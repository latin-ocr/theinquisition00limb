only to declare that nothing is legally done against him, on Account of which
he may, or ought to be pronomiced an Heretick, or any ways be suspecled
of heretical Pravity; and that therefore he is wholly released from his pre-
sent Trial, Inquisttion and Judgment. But they carefully avoid putting into
his Sentence that he was innocent, or not guilty, that if so be he should after-
wards be informed against, and the Crime legally proved, he may be con-
demned notwithstanding the aforesaid Sentence of Absolution‚ But isit should
huppen that any one is pronounced wholly innocent, and is afterwards accu-
sed of the same Crime, their Docirine is, that notwithstanding his Sentence of
Absolution‚ he may be again judged and condemned ·, because, inthis crime
no Sentences whatsoever can ever be accounted as an adjudged Case, in Favour
of the F aith. This Pius V. hath determined by a certain Rescript, which 1
shall here give intire‚.

nating alt Herefies, and the evil Principles of erroneous Opinions. Since therefore,
even when in alo-wer Station we managed the Affairs of the most holy Offise of the
Roman and Univeiy'al Inquzfition against heretical Pravity, we have at length by
long Ufie, and that Experience which leads into the true Undetstanding of ‘spis-'535²
