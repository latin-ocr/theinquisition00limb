Bzovius, vincial Council, in February, 1528. in which, after he had condemned ther
a·1528· Dostrine of Luther‚ Melantton, Suinglius, Oecolampadius and their Followers‚
§- 41· he publiffi'd a general Decree, by which he declares and renews all the anci-
ent Canons of the Lateran Council against Hereticks‚ their Favourers and
Defenders, Persons suspe& of Heresy, and relapsed, as they are extantin the
Decretals, and sometimes guards them by annexing a Puniffiment. He more-
over ordains, T hat the Suffragans‚ if they suspett any Places of Herejy‚. shall imme-
diately go themselves, or send other fit Persem, and oblige those of the Neighhourhood‚
by an Oath, to discover such Hereticks‚ who keep unlawful Conventicles. He alst)
strictly commands them, ffhat the should proceed with all Diligence and Care in
this Affair‚ and proceedsummari y and openly in the Busincss of such heretical Pra-
vity. And if they be remiſs or negligent in purging out this Leaven, let them
know that they shall incur the Punishments ordained by the Sacred General La·-
teron Council. Let them also tremble at the Punishments puhlifhed against the
Inquisttors, who offend in their Office, by the Sacred Council of Vienne. Let the· Suf-
fragans also diligently ohserve the Constitutions of Urban V. Clement. V. and
Boniface VIII. He beseeches mox-coverv the King, ‘That he would= imme·-
diately drive out all Hereticks from every Part of his Dominions. Lastly‚ he
ordains, That the Rulers and Confitls of Cities shall take a corporal Oath, ac-
cording to the Sacred General Lateran Council 3 that they will, according to their
Office, affist, with all their Might, and-lend their helping Hands‚ faithfully and
effectually‚ to the Church in this Affair of Hercfi, when it shall he demanded of
them. And whereas the Bifhops and Inquisttors‚ whilst they proceed in this Mat-
ter, may poffibly require Afflstance from secular Judges under Excommunication, he
declares they shall not incur Excommu'nication by st) doing. To these Things he
adds, in the Conclufion‚ after having recounted various Errors that had
been condemn’d‚ an Exhortation to Christian PrinceS, that they should la-
bour to extirpate Heretick33 and sets before them the Examples of Con-
stantine, Valentinian, Theodosius, and others, who by. their vigorous Endea-
vours against Heredeks, found Favour with God, and obtained immortal
Honour amongst Men. And on the other hand, puts them in Mind of
Licinius, Julian, Valens, and others, who experienced the Revenges of the Di-
vine Anger, and received the just Rewards of their Wickednes53 because,
far from refisting heretical Errors, they supported and propagated them.
He earnestly befieches and exhorts in the Lord, the Christian Princes, that as they
would consult their Safety, as they would preserve unhurt their Rights of Sovereign-
ty, and as they defire to preserve in Peace and Tranquility the Nations subjefft
to them, they would powerfully defend the Catholick Faith‚ and endeavour to
their utmost to ⁵suppreſs the Enemies of it. This will be easy, when the aulient
Editts of Christian Princes against Hereticks‚ their Books and Favourers, are re·-

stored. When once these are put in Exccution with an wholesome Severity‚ thera
