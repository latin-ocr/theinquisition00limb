differed from them, and stained most of them their CharaRers with the Guilt
of Rapine and Murder. Their religious Quarrels were managed with
such an unrelenting, furious Zeal, as disturbed the imperial Government,
threw Kingdoms and Nations into Confusion, and turned the Church it self
into an Aceldama, or Field of Blood. Some few there have been who were
of a different Spirit, who not only abstained from persecuting Counsels and.
Measures themselveS, but with great Justice and Freedom censured thern in
others. But: as to your Saints and fathers, your Patriarchs and Bishops,
your Councils and Synods, together with the Rabble of Monks, they were
most of them the Advisers‚ Abetters and Prafficers of Persecution. They
knew not how to brook Oppofition to their own Opinions and Power, brand-
ed all Doetrines different from their own, with the odious Name of Heresy,
and used all their Arts and Influence to oppress and destroy those who pre-
sumed to maintain them. And this they did with such Unanimity and Con-
stancy, through a lon-g Succeffion of many Ages, as would tempt a stander
by to think, that a Biffiop or Clergyman, and a Persecutor, were the same
Thing, or meant the self same individual Charafier and Offiee in the Chri÷
stian Church.

I arn far from writing these Things with any Design to depreciate and
blacken the episcopal Order in general. ’Tss an Office of great Dignity
and Use, according to the original Design ofits Institution. But when that
Design is sorgotten‚ or wholly perverted 3 when, instead of becoming Over-
seem of the Flock of Christ, the Bishops tare and devour it, and proudly usurp Do-
minion over the Consciences of Christians‚ when they ought to be content
with being Helpers of their Joy, I know no Reason why the Name should‘
be complimented, or the CharaGler held sacred, when ’tis abused to Inso-
lence, Oppreffion and Tyranny ς or why the venerable Names of Fathers and
saints, should screen the Vices of the Bifhops of former Ages, who, not-
withstanding their writing in behalf of Christianity and Orthodoxy, brought
some of them the greatest Disgrace on the Christian Religion, by their wic-
ked Praetices, and exposed it to the severest Satyrs of its profeffed Enemies:
And for the Truth of this, Iappeal to the foregoing History. If any Ob-

what Use and Application of them they please. Sure I am that the repre·
senting them in their true Light, refleRS an Honour upon those reverend
and worthy Prelates‚ who maintain that Moderation and Humility, which is
effential to the true Dignity of the Episcopal Charadrer, and who use no
other Methods of ConviCtion and Persuafion‚ but those truly Apostolical ones,
of sound Reasoning and exemplary Piety. May God grant a great Increast,
and a continual Succeffion of them in the Christian Church.
