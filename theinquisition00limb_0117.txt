ture in their Defence, they, some of them, made use of infamous Methods ¹⁴ffe²0r35

of Scandal, and endeavoured to blast the Cliarac’ter of a reverend and wor-
thy Divine Dr. Williams, in the most desperate Manner 3 because they could
no otherwise answer and refute his Arguments. But his Virtue stood the
Shock of all their Attempts to defame it3 for after, about eight Weeks
spent in an Enquiry into his Life, by a Committee ofthe united Ministers‚ which
received all Manner ofComplaints and Accusations against him ,- it was decla-
red at a general Meeting, as their unanimous Opinion, and repeated and a·-
greed to in three several Meetings succeffively, that he was intirely clear and
innocent of all that was laid to his Charge· Thus was he vindicated in the
amplest Form, after the stristest Examination that could be made, and his
Adversaries, who dealt in Defamation and Scandal, if not brought to Re-
pentance, were yet put to Silence. It was almost incredible how much he was
aSufferer for his Oppofition to Antinomiamfin, by a strong Parry, who left no-
thing unattempted to crush him, if it had been poffible· But as his Inno-
cence appeared the brighter, after his Chara&er had been thoroughly fifted,
he was, under God, greatly instrumental in putting a Stop to thole pernici·
ous Opinions which his Opposers propagated3 which struck at the very Es«
sentials of all natural and revealed Religion. His Gospel ‘Ti‘uth remains a
Monument of his Honour, a Monument his Enemies were never able to
destroy. However, nothing would serve but his Exclufion from the Mer-
chant's Leffiire at Pinnem-Hall. Three other worthy Divines, who had been
his Partners in that Service‚ bore him Company, and their Places were sup-
plied with four others, of unquestionable Rigidness and Sterling Ortho-
doxy· Many Papers were drawn up on each Side, in order to an Accomrno-
dation ς so that it looked, as Dr· Calamy tells us, as if the Creed making Age
was again revived. It was infisted, that Arminiantsm should be renounced on
one Side, and Antinomianism on the other. But all was in vain; and the
Papers that were drawn up to compose Matters created new Heats, instead
of extinguilhing the old ones. These Contentions were kept up for several
Years, till at last, the Disputants grew weary, and the Controversy thread·
bare, when it dropped of it self.

The next Thing that divided them was the Trinitarian controversy, and
the Affair ofSubscription to human Creeds and Articles ofFaith, as a Test of
Orthodoxy. In the Year 1695. a great Contest arose about the Trinity, amongst
the Divines of the Church of England, who charged each other with Trime-
:sm and Sabelliamssn ς and according to the ecclefiastical Manner of managing
Disputes, bestowed Inveffives and scurrilous Language very plentifully, up-
on each other. The Dissenters, in the Reign of his late Majesty, not only
unfortunately fell into the same Debate, but carried it on, some of them
at least, with equal want of Prudence and Temper. In the west of Englsmd,
where the Fire first broke out, Moderation, Christian Forbearance, and
Charity, seemed to have been wholly extinguished. The Reverend and

Learned Mr. James Peme, Minister in the City of Exeter, was dismiss'ed frptjn
