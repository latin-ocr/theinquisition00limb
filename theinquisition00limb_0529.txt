risdiffiffion of the Inquifitors. For the Church (loth not judge of those that
are without, and the Jurisdiffion of the Inquifitors is only granted them
against heretica! Pravity and Apostacy. The Inquisition indeed in Spain is in-
troduced against those, who being converted from the Jews or iwahometnns,
to the Christian Religion, return again to Jztdczism or Ilsnlbonzetnnism³ and
give such Marks of that Apostacy as are capable to conviet- t'hem. Such a
one, as well as a Christian, that goes over to the Jewish Rites, may be pu-
nished by the Inquifitors as any other Heretick or Apol-iate. And in order
to prove this Crime, they admit the Testimony of Jews 3 and when it is
legally proved, they are by the royal Laws of Spain delivered over, as Re„
lapsed and Impenitent‚ to the Fire.

Belides this there are other Cases in which the Jews are subject to the In-

quisition, concerning which Znnchinus de haereticz's, and Campegius discourse‚Aaot. ai
and which I shall here mention. ⁶⁶ Because the Church doth notjudge 0fZanchin.
⁶⁶ those who are without, some, without making any Difference, l)elieve,⁶· 3⁶·
⁶⁶ that the Inquifitors can’t proceed against the Jews, nor punish them. O-
⁶⁶ thers indeed grant, that the Jews are not against their Wills to be com-
“ pelled to receive the Christian Faith, or Baptism, but yet that in certain
⁶⁶ Cases they are subjecft to the Inquifitors. And to prove it they use this Diu
⁶⁶ stinction. A Jew either offends by Contempt of the Orthodox Faith, or
⁶⁶ hindring the -Office of the Inqui-fition. Or else as to their own Faith, or
*ί otherwise not relating to ‘the Premisses. In the two latter Cases this is
⁶⁶ nothing to the Inquifitor. But if he offends as to the Contempt of the
⁶⁶ Faith‚ by reproaching the Churches or Altars, or even the sacred Orna-
⁶⁴⁶ ments of the Church, and the like, or hinders the Inquisltor in the Dia
‘⁶ spatch of his Office, the Inquifitor may proceed against him, because the
‘⁶ Nature of his Offence is such as subjects it to the Court of >the Church.
<⁶ The Penalties by which such a Jew may be punilhed, are various. Chri—
⁶⁶ stians may be forbid to have any thing to do with him, and this is a
⁶⁶ most grievous Punifhment to Ilve amongst Men, and to be absolutely de-
⁶⁶ prived of their Affistance. He may also be fined, and receive other cor-
⁶⁶ poralPunilhment‚ viz. Imprisonment or Whipping.'’ · ,

There are yet other CaseS‚ in which the Jews are subject to the Inquifitor, Cam e ”
if they relapse into Judaism, or if any one simply forlakes Christianity forin zagcgh.
Judaz'snz, orif a Jew persuades a Christian to the Jewish Rites. All which c. 36.
are mentioned in the Extravagant of Gregory X. to the Inquifitors of the Pre-
dicant and Minor Orders, in the Year 1 271. With Gricf ofHeart we have heard
and relate, that not only certain Penlons converted from the Error of Jewish Dark-
ness to the Light of the Christian Fausto, are known to return to their former
-Wickedness ·‚ hut that nznny Christians denying the Truth of the catholic-k
Faith‚ have damnably gone over to the Jewish Rites. This is so much the more
reprobate, as hereby the most holy Name of Chrzst z's by a kind of friendly Enmisy
more ftcurely blasphemed. Since therefore it becomes us to obviate by fit and [βατὴ
Remedies this damnable Plagae, by these Apostolick {Vritingn we command all of 5071,
