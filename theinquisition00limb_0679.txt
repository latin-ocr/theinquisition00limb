cause all Places are subje& to the same chief Pontiff‚ by whom all the Inqui-
fitors are delegated. To this may be added the punishment of being thrnst
into a Monastery, which, tho' now seldom inflieted, was much more in use
formerly. Bzovius gives us an Instance of it in the Year 1479. “ Thisgs. 8.
“ Year was condemned at Mayence, John Ram-sd, of the Upper Wefel,
“ D. D. and compellcd by the Inquifitor to recant certain Articles which'he
⁴⁶ was reported publickly to have preached at Worms. All his W‘ritings
“ were before his Face thrown into the Fire and burnt, and he himself sent
‘⁸ to do Penance to the Convent of Austin Friars in that Place, where he died
‘⁶ in alittle while of Grief.'' Bzovius also relates the Articles against him,
most of which were against the Papal Authority. The first of them deserves
to be mentioned: T hat the Prelates of the Church have no Authority to ordain or
add any &thing to what Christ and his Apostles have ordained: Tea, that neither
Apostles nor the Popes have received fitch Power from Christ.

There is also another Punishment of Beating or Whipping‚ when Criminals
are condemned to be whipped with Scourges or Rods. If they are religious
Pei-sons, they are whipped in their own Monastery by other Religious, in the
‘Presence of the Notary of the holy Office. This Punilhment, Paramur be-l. ιε. ς.
ing Witness, Laurentius Valla suffered, who being condemned sor Heresy ate-4· ΜΩ
Naples, was preserved from the F ire by the King's F avour, but upon this
Condition‚ that after he had publickly recanted and damned the Things he
had uttered, he should atone for his Crimes by Whipping. And accordingly
in the Convent of the Predicants, being led round the Cloysters with his
Hands tied, he was whipped upon his Shoulders and Back, by the Religious of
the House.

Sometimes they are condemned to Fines, according to the Rescript of A·
lexander IV. Super exstirpatione3 and this they are especially defirous of laying
upon rich and covetous Persons. Alexander IV. makes this Dispofition in the
Affair. As to the Money which may poffibly arist from such Puntfhments, or from
the third Part of the Fines or Condemnations, to be exacted from such Persons and
Places, or from the EffeHs to be seized on by Occafion of Heresy or Hereticks,
according to the Tenour of our Constitutions, let it be depofited in the Hands of
three faithful and approved Men, to be choftn by you and the Diocestzn, or his
Vicar in his Absence, and be faithfully kept by them, and let such Expences as
are neceffary to the Prosecution of the Affair against Hereticks‚ be allowed you,
and every one of you, without any Difficulty, by the Advice of the Bifhop hirnjelf,
and let a full and faithful Account be given to the said Diocesan of all stzch Ex-

enses.
p But here must be observed what Zanchinus reaches. “ If the Inquisitorczp. Μ’·
“ condemns any one as an Heretick, he can’t condemn him in a certain Sum
“ of Money‚ for two Reasons. First, because as he condemns him for an
“ Heretick, all his Effeets are to be taken from him ·, so that since his All
“ isto be forfeited, 'tis idle to talk of taking from him a Part, or any
“ Thing less than All. Secondly, because as he condemns him for Heresy,
