this Guilt, that the Things for which Christians have persecuted each other,
have been generally Matters of no Importance in Religion, and ostentm&
such as bave been direffly contrary to the Nature of it. If my Reader
would know upon what Accounts the Church harh been filled with Divisions
and Schisms‚· why Excommunications and Anathemas have been so dread-
fully tossed about ς what hath given Occasion to such a Multitude of Sus-
penfions‚ Depositions and Expulfions; what hath excited the Clergy to such
number-less Violence8‚ RapineS, Cruelties and Murders, he will probably be
surprized to be informed, that ’tis nothing of any Consequence or real lm-
portance, nothing relating to the Substance and Life of pure and unde-
filed Religion3 little belides hard Words, technical Terms, and inexplica-

ble Phrases‚ Points of mere Speculation‚ abstruse Qestims, and metaphysi-

cal Notions3 Rites and Ceremonies, Forms of human Invention, and cer-
tain Institutions, that have had their Rise and Foundation only in Supersti-
tion. These have been the great Engines of Divifi0n3 these the sad Occa-
sions of Persecution- Would it not excite sometimes Laughter, and some<-
times Indignation, to read ofa proud and imperious Prelate‚excommunicating
the whole Christian Church, and sending, by Wholesale‚ to the Devil‚ all
who did not agree with him in the precise Day of observing Easter ἓ Especi-
ally when there is so far from being any Direffion given by Christ or his
Apostles about the Day3 that there is not a single Word about the Festi-
val it self0 And is it not an amazing Instance of Stupidity and Superstition‚
that such a paltry and whimfical Controversy lhould aetually engage, for ma·
ny Years‚ the whole Christian world, and be debated with as much Warmth
and Eagerness‚ as if all the Interests of the present and future State had
been at Stake; as if Christ himself had been to be crucified afresh, and
his whole Gospel to be subverted and destroy'd.

The Arian Controversy, that made such Havoek in the Christian Church,
was, if I may be allowed to speak it without offeram», in the Beginning
only, about Words; though probably, some of Arius his Party went farther
afterwards than Arius himself did at first. Arius, as hath been shewn, ex·
pressy allowed the Son to be περ χρονων 4} ‘esea mma-112 before all ‘Times and Ages,
πληςπς Θεος, Persen G⁰d2 duanam-705, anchangeable‚ and begotten after the most
perfecit Likeness of the unbegotten Father. This, to me, appears to bid
very fair for Orthodoxy‚ and was, I think, enough to have reconciled the
Biihop and his Presbyter, if there had not been some other Reasons of the
Animofity between thern. But when other Terms were invented, that were
hard to be understood, and difficult to be explained3 the original Controver-
sy ceased‚ and the D³spute then was about the Meaning of those Terms, and
the Fitness of their Use in explaining the Divinity of the Son of God. Asia,-
knew not how to reconcile the Bishop's Words, aaymm, ever begotten3 with
the Assertion, that the Son, συνυπαρχει αγεννητως τω θέω, coexists unbegottenly with
θοάς and thought it little less than a Contradiffion to affirm, that he was
αγςμνηΊογςνης, unbegottenly begotten. And as to the Word mmm, Cim-substantia&
Arius seems to have thought that it destroy'd the personal Subfistence quthe
