1535. This Decree abundantly shews, that the Inquifition was brought into
Portugal before this Year, and that the Course of it had been for some

Lewis Paramur relates‚ whom many others follow, ‘⁶ That one Sahavm'ra of De oss-'gg

“ 1539. by forged Letters or Bulls, and declared that he was sent by the·
“ chief Pontiff to‘ erest the sacred Tribunal of the Inquifition in this King-

“ But that afterwards confidering the great Advantage that would arise

“ himself, written by his own Hand.” This short Account is taken from
the larger one of Pareamus, by Anthony de δουβτ, a Predicant‚ Master of
Divinity, Counsellor of the King, and of the snpream Tribunal of the holy
Inquifition, inhis History of the Portngczllnquisition prefixed to his Apho-
