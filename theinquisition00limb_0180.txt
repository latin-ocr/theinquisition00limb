12 The H1s‘r0n’r of the INQUISrTon.

“ those especially wherein their Errors and Herelies are taught ·, according

Thus did the Christians imitate the Heathen Cruelty, by. persecuting those
that differed from them, and followed the Example of Julian, in destroying
their Schools, which the Heathens themselves condemned as barbarous and
cruel: For thus Ammianus Marcellinus declares, b. 25.. His Laws, ahsolutaly
commanding stnne Things to be done, andforbidding others, were generally good, some
few excepted 3 among which was that cruel one, by which he prohibited the Clam·-
stian Masters of Rhetorick and Grammar to teach‚ to prevent any from forsaking
the Worship of the Gods: But in Process of Time, under the Government of
the Popes„the Ediets of the Christians vastly exceeded this Cruelty of Julian.
'Tis true, these were Laws made by the Civil Magistrate, but that they
were publiffied with the Approbation of the Bishops, no one can doubt, who
compares our Times with the Antient. The Bissmps could not bear that their
Decrees and Anathemas should be ssighted as infignificant and harmless F lafhes.
They would fain have all condemned by their Sentence appear to others to
be justly condemned ; and eagerly thirsted after the Mitres and Churches of
those, whose Doctrines they were pleased to anathematize3 and therefore,
in order to get Poffeffion of them, it was found neceffary to arm the secular
Power, and to ena& civil Laws against them, that hereby they might strip
them of their DignitieS, and drive them into Banishment, in order to enter on
their vacant Sees. Nor let any one imagine, that the ancient Times were
more holy than ours ·‚ the same worldly Spirit that now influences our SynodS‚
governed the Councils of the ancient Bishops: Even the Council of Nice, so
much celebrated and extolled, is an abundant Proof of this. Such was the
fierce and. restless Spirit of the Bishops there met together·, so many and
bitter their Contentions, that, forgetting the principal Cause of· their meet-
ing together, they meanly presented Accusations against each other to the Em.-
peror, who, that he might put an End to their Qarrels‚ ordered the Ac·-
cusations to be burnt 3 and commanded them that they should immediately go

ing nothing but Revenge, would rest contented, with having'procured the
Condemnation only of their hated Enemies, and not rather use their utmost
Endeavours to excite the Emperor to banish those whom they had condemned?
5³1st Ec. tssut not to rely on Conjectures, Socrates expressy tells us: ‘⁶ That Theodofius
7.c. 3· ‘⁶ Bishop of Synada in the greater Phrygia, crueily persecuted the Hereticks
’ “ of the Macedonian ὃεὲὶ, of which there was a great Number. in that
“ City 3 driving them not only from the City‚ but from the very Coumry
“ also·, not according to the Custom of the orthodox Church, which uses no Me—
“ thods of Persecution‚ nor thro’ Zeal for the true Faith.·, but from a covetous
“ Defire of enriching himself with the Spoils of the Hereticks. To this End
⁸‘ he left no Means untried to ruin' the F ollowers of Mandonius, arming his
⁴⁶ Clergy, and persecuting them by innumerable subtle Methods, and Tricks
“⁶ of LaW. But his Malice was principally levelled against their Bishop Aga-
