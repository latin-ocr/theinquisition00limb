The Hrsromr ofthe INQUISITION. 129

Jews and Moors in Portugal, who would not profess the Christian Religion, to Raynald:
depart the Kingdom, and set them a Day, after which, if any of thern were “- ¹496·
found there, they should forfeit their Liberty. The Moors immediately passed §⁰ ²6³ ἃς·
over into Africa. And as the Jews were preparing to depart, the King com- Βῑονῐιιε,
manded that all their Children, who were not above fourteen Years old, should ‘²- 1497·
be taken from their Parents, and educated in the Christian Religion. It was §. ²⁷·

a most affeffing Thing, to see Children snatched from the Embraces of their
Mothers, and F athers embracing their Children violently torn from them,

and even beat with Clubs, to hear the dreadful Cries they made, and every

Place filled with the Lamentations and Yells of Women. Many through In-
dignation threw their Sons into PitS, and others killed them with their own
Hands. What added to their Misery was, that those who would have gone

over to Africa to avoid these Evsss, were not suffered ·‚ for the King deferred
giving them the Liberty of sailing Day aster Day. And although at first he
assigned them three Ports, where they might go on board, he afterwards
forbid their sailing from any other but that of Lisbon. This brought a vast
Number of the Jews to that City. Bu in the mean while the appointed Day

was past, so that such of them as could not get off were necessarily made
Slaves. Most of them being overcoire with these Calamities, chose rather
either fincerely or feignedly, to malie Profeffion of Christianity, than to

live in such Miseries, and being baptized, recovered their Liberty and Chil-

dren. No Violence however was offered to the Affoors, least the Saracena· in

Asta and Africa should make Reprisals on the Christians in those Countries.

The Papists usually ascribe “his Afflon of the King’s to a pious Mind, and
his Zeal to propagate the Christian Religion, and provide sor the Salvation
of Children, and yet in the mean while condemn it as wicked and unjust,
and contrary to the Laws and Constitution of the Gospel 3 since it is not law-
ful to compel any one against his Will to the Christian Worship, or to take
Children from their Parents, unless the Parents forfeit their Right in them by
their Crimes.

In the Year 1500, Francis Ximenes, Archbishop of Toledc), by the Pope’s Bzovius,
Persuasion, took great Pains to convert the Moors of Granada to the Christiana. 1500-
Faith. He first of all gained over their chiefPriests‚ which they call Affa- ἓν· ¹⁶·
quim, by Gifts and Favours. A great Number followed their Example.
However others vigoroussy opposed szenes, and endeavoured to deter the
Moors from Christianity. Ximenes ordered these to be put in Irons in Prison,
and to be very cruelly used. Of this Number was one Zegri, who was the most
powerful amongst them, upon account of the Nobility of his Birth, and his
excellent Qalifications of Mind- and Body. Ximenes lay‘ng aſsde almost all
Humanity, determined to pumfh him most severely. He delivered him to one Peter
Lym, his Chaplain, a Man ofatruly Lyon—Zz'ke Mad, who soon brought him
to Ximenes his Beck, and made him in a few Days desire to be carried before
the Alfaquin of the Christians. Bound and dirty as he was, he came before
Ximenes, and declared he would be a Christian, for that he had had a Vifion
from Ala (as the Moors call God) that Night, admonissiing him to it. Blut
