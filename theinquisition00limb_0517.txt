W I TH these Fortune-Tellers are properly joined Witches or Hags,

which in Italy they commonly call Strigiae, from their Resemblance to
the Scritch-Owl, a Night and troublesome Bird‚ because they are reported
to deal in their Witchcraft principally at Night, and to suck the Blood os
Infants. Others call them Sorcerefl‘es, Charmers, and the like. They areB rrrrr d.

, said to have been a Se& of People, principally &Vomem who arose in Italy incon3enfis ΑΒ

the Year 1400. They gather together in certain Places near T owns and-suffia
Villages, at particular Times, and especially the Night preceding Friday‚
when the Devil appears to them in a vifible human Shape. When they en«
ter into this Gang, they first, and before all Tfflngs, do, by the Devil’s
Command, deny their holy Faith and Baptism, the Lord God, and the
bleffed Virgin Mary, and after this trample under their Feet on the Ground,
a Cross made by one ofthe Witches. After this they promise Allegiance bea
tween the Hands of the Devil, taking him for their Lord, and promise Obea
dience to him in all Things. As a Token of all this, they put their left Hand
behind their Back, and touch the Devil's Hand, and offer him somewhat as
a Mark of their Subjection. From henceforth they are said to believe the De<
vil to be their true Lord and God·, and as often as they go to their nightly=
Affemblies‚ which they call the Play of good Fellowship, they worship the
Devil appearing in human Shape, and by bowing their Head profoundly·
down, adore him as their true God. 'Tis reported of thern, that they go
to this Affembly or Play, truly and corporally, when awake and in> their
perfect Senses: lf the Place benear they go on Foot3 if distant, they are
carried by the Devil through the Air.

Many Authors have written largely of these Witches or Hags, James S prex*
ger, Sylvcster de Prierz'o, Bartholomew Spineus, and others, who warmly con-
tend that they are all corporally carried to these Night—Plays or Dances,
