 

The Hrs‘ronv ofthe INQUISITION, -757

House, upon a Coffer covered over with a Linnen Cloth‚ and often commu-
nicated of that Bread, believing it to be the true Body of Christ. After
four Years he was thrown into Prison, and was very difficultly prevailed with
to abjure his Error. But whilst he was in his Imprisonment, he was found to
have relapsed into the same Error, and to have repeated this Ceremony. But
before he was punished as a Relapse, he died in Jayl, without a Confeffion
ofhis Sins, and the Sacrament of the Eucharist. The Inquifit01·s commanded
his Body to be taken up and burnt.

Raynczld gives us another Instance of one, who did not indeed celebrate 01
administer the Sacrament of Penance as a Priest‚ though he really was none,
but who said he was a Bishop, though he had not 'the Pope’s Bull, and as such
consecrated Priests. And because 116 was made an Example of extream
Cruelty, Iwill here relate the Matter exaffly as I find it in his Annals.

‘⁶ James the Priest, a false Minorite‚ born in the DutchyofJulz'ers, forged
“ the Pope's Bull, and declared in the Netherlands that he was a Bishop;
‘⁶ and although he had not been ordained a Bilhop, 116 consecrated Priests
“ by a false Ceremony in several Dioceses of Germany and the Low Countrien
“ At length he was convicled ofhis Wickedness, and the Magistrates 01 Utrecht
‘⁵ thought fit, not to condemn him to the Flames‚ that he might be quickly
‘⁶ consumed, but to be gradually burnt by boiling Water, that so they
‘⁶ might conquer his Obstinacy, because he most impudently refused to
(ἶ acknowledge his Crime. But being gradually let down into the boiling
‘⁶ Cauldron, and overcome with the Extremity of the Pain, he detested his
‘⁶ Wickedness, and pray’d that: he might receive a milder Punilhment. His
“ Judges being moved with Compaffion, ordered him to be taken out ofthe
“ boiling Cauldr0n‚ and then to be beheaded.'' Hedcz tells the same Story in
fewer Words, in the Life of Florentius, the fiftieth Bishop 01 Utrecht. “ A cer-
“ tain Person of the Profeffion of St. Francis, took upon him the Charaeter
“ of a Priest and Bishop, and ofSuffragan to Bishop Florentius. And having
“ for a long while performed all sacred Offices, it was at last discovered, that
‘⁶ his Charaeler and Letters were forged. Upon this he was deprived, and
‘⁶ condemned to be put in boi³ing VVater, But as soon as ever he was thrown
“ into it, he moved, by his Cries, the Compaffion of the Eishop‚ and was
“ immediately taken out, and being beheaded‚ obtained the Favour of Bu-
“ rial. Most of those who were consecrated by him, were reconsecrated by
“ some other Biffiop, whilst others returned to the World and married, all his
‘⁶ Acts being null and void.''

In the Records of the Chapter 01 St. Saviozlr’s at Utrecht, in the forecited
Book, fol. 105. 53³ seq. this very Story 13 to be read, anzi the Sentence
against the said James is added3 and because it gives us a just· Accounc ot'
the Custom of that Age, I will here faithfully transcribe it, as I find it 111
the said Book.

“ In the Year of our Lord 1392. Sept. 30. one James, of the Order osthc
“ Friars Minor, a Presbyter, born in the Dutchy osJa‘licrs, was verbally
.‘.‘ and affitually degraded, in the Manner'underorecitess inthe City of‘}slz'0⁴cl-2l»
