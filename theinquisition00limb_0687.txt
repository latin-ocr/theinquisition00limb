‘⁶ lhew'd the same Liberality to some others, who prayed to be affisted with
‘⁶ the Money arifing from these Sambenito’s‚ to redeem their Brethren or
“ Kindrcd from Turkifh or Mem-ist) Captivity. But ifany one desires thus to be
‘⁶ freed from his Sambenito, 'tis necessary before all Things, in order to ob-
“ tain his Defire from the King‚ that he before—hand secure the good Will of
“ the Inquifitors and Secretaries. For otherwise, tho' the King himselfshould
“ grant it, and the Money be paid down, they would use all their Endeavours
“ to frustrate it, and would cunningly and malicioussy tllrow in effestual Ob«

“ ter informed of the Affair‚ and even the Pope himself, if he should have
“ happened to grant the Absolution. And if the Matter should 601116 thus

Belides this Condemnation to perpetual Imprisonment, such Persons are
also injoined other Penances, viz. Sometimes to stand in the Habit marked

: , with the Cross at the Door of such a Church, such 3 Time, and so long,

viz. on the four principal Festivals of the glorious Virgin Μαι-γ of such a
Church, or on such and such Festivals‚ at the Gates of such and such Churches.
Concerning this there is 3 Decree extant of the Council of Biterre, c. 26.
where, after commanding that Penitents should be present at divine Service
on Sundays and F estivals, this is added, That on the Mass of every Sunday and
Festival‚ between the Epistle and the Gospel‚ they shall publickly present themselves
with Rods in their Hands, stripped of their oulward Garment, and with their Veil
or Hat off, to the Priestcelebrating Mass in the Presence of the People‚ and there,
after having received Discipline, the Priestfhall declam, that they suffer this Disci-
pline for heretical Pravity. Sometimes before they are ffiut up in Prison, they
are publickly exposed, viz. being cloathed with the Habit os the Croffes,
they are placed upon an high Ladder in the Gate of some Church, that they
may be plainly seen by all, where they must stand till Dinner-time‚ after
which they must be carried, cloathed in the same Habit, to the same Place,
at the first Ringing to Vespers, and there stand till Sun set 3 and these 8116813-
cles are usually repeated on several Sundays and Festivals in several Churches,
which 316 particularly specified in their Sentence. However, there is no
mention made in the Book of the Sentences 01 1116 Tholouse Inquifition‚ of
such a 8116613616, 011 1116 Α66011111 of Heresy, but of two only who were con-
demned for false Witness. But if they break Prison, or do not otherwise ful-
fill the Penances injoined them, they are condemned as Impenitents, and as
under the Guilt of their former Crimes; and if they fall again into the
Hands of the Inquifitors, they are delivered over as Impenitents to the secu-

the Commands of the Inquifitors. Thus ’tis determined by the Council of
