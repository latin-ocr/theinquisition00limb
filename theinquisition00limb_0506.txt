“ upon a certain Scaffold built os Wood, in the Market—place of the city,
“ which they call Noede, because he assumed to himself, by certain false A-
‘'‘ postolick Letters which he had forged, the Title and Narne of the Bishop
‘¹¹' of Laubatch, and being for some tinne taken as a. Suffragan to the Bishop of
“ Utrecht, had presumed to celebrate and exercise the leffer and greater Or-
‘⁶ ders, and other Episcopal Functions in the said Bishop’s Diocese, and for
“ ten Years before that in the Dioceses of Treves, Mayence, and Strasburg. After
“ his Degradation, he was delivered over as a Laick to the Scultet and Sca·
“ hines * osUtrecht, who were present, and received him into their Court·, and
“ by their Sentence, Florentius, Lord B‘ishop of Utrecht, prefiding· in the
“ said Place, the said James was condemned to be burntwith Fire, in a Caul-
“ dron, made ready for that Purpose near the Scaffold. But he was at last
“ gracioussy taken out of the Cauldron, and beheaded in the same Place.

‘⁶ And therefore the aforesaid Lord Florentius, and the fix under-written
“ Bishops, more being met together, and each of thern robed in their Pon-

Judges together in the under-written Affaz‘r. The Empire of Reason presiding in
the Mina cf the Judge, Justice fils upon the Tribunal in the Examination of ‘Truth‚
and the Righteousng-'i of the Judges, as a King upon the Throne, out of whose Mouth
proceeds a t·zco-edged S word. By the terrible Aspeff of which the Pleasitre of a Man's
own Will is scattered, and the criminal‘ Appetite of the Wicked, without RespeH of
Persons, is limited under the Rule of the Law. For this hath been taken Care of
by the Judge, from whose Countenance right Judgment proceeds, that Judges should be
appointed in the bVorlcl, who should love Righteousness, judge the Children of Men,
and punish Offenders, according to the A'sIeaficre of their Fault. Attending therefore
with great Grief of Heart to thy heinous Wickedness, unheard ofin all Ages, which
thou hast' committed, who art the Head of ScundaZ, and Rock of Offence, and with
frequent Sighs and Groans recounting the most unhappy Boldneſs of thy Rashness,
which even disturbs the Heaven, and makes the very Earth to tremble, we are
forced, Justice demanding it, to proceed against thee, to that just Punifhment and‘
Revenge which thou hast deserved. Having therefore called on the Name of Christ,
fitting on our Tribunal, and having God only before our Eyes, and having taken the
Counsel of prudent and skilful Persons; whereas hy thy Confcffion, and by other
,Proof, it evidently auid legally appears to us, that thou hastforged Apostolical Lat.-
