The HrsroRY ofthe INQU'ISITION.

S'tivers, This agrees with the Account of Isaack Orobio, who had a plentiful
Fortune at Seville, and was nevertheless used very hardly in the Prison of the
Inquifition there. Although his Estate was very large, yet he was allowed a
very small Penfion to provide himself Provifion. This was Flesh, which they
made him sometimes dress and repare for himself, without allowing him the
Helpos any Servant. In this iiffanner are the richer Prisoners treated. As
to the pomer, and such who have not enough to supply themselves in Jayl,
their A‘llowance is fixed by the King‚ viz. the Half of 'a sslver Piece of Mo*

honest; first by the Receiver, then the Dispenser, then the Cook, then the
Jayl-Keeper‚ who, according to his Office, distributes the Provision
amongst the Prisoners. Gbnsalvius adds, that he gave this particular
Account of this Matter‚ because all these Persons live, and have their cer-
tain Profits out of this small Allowance of the King to the Prisoners, which

coming to them through the crooked Hands of these Harpies‚ they cannot ³

receive it till every one of them hath taken out more than a tenth Part
of it,

The Author of the History of the Inquifition at Goa tells υς, this Order is
observed in distributing the Provifions. The Prisoners have Meat given them
three times every Day3 and even those who have the Misfortune to be
in this Case, and they have Money, are not treated much better than o-
thers, because their Riches are employ'd to make Provifion for the Poorer.
Iwas insormed by Isaack Orohi0‚ that in Spain they sometimes give the Pri-
soners Coals, which they must light, and then dress their own Food. Some.-
times they allow them a Candle. Those who are confined in the lower Cellsae

ment, and by the Miseries of it forced to confess Things which ostentimes
they have never done.

And how dreadful the Miseries of this Prison are, we have a famous In· p

stance given us by Reginald Gonsalvius Montanus. In the Age before the last, a
certain English Ship put in at the Port of Cadiz, which the Familiars of the
Inqtiifition, according to Custom, searched upon the Account of Religion,
before they suffered any· Person to come a-shore. They seized on several
