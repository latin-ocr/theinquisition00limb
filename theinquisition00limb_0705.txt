 

The H1 STORY ofthe IN-Quisimom 275

Because Negatives constantly deny the Crime ot Heresy, and profess that
they are, and always were Catholicks‚ and are willing to die in the Faith of
the Catholici< Church, they are first strangled before they are burnt. But
Souza says, that Hereticks convist and negative, if after they are delivered to Ι· 3· ⁶- 65
the secular Judge‚ they do not confess before him the Catholick Faith‚ are §- Π· .
burnt alive3 because, as it appears that they are Hereticks, so by being li-
lent when they ought to answer, they are looked upon as obstinate. Thus it was
-astuallyjudged by all the Judges of the Council of Supplication in the City of
Lisbon‚ An. 1629. the second Sunday of September, and twelfth Day of that
Month‚ when, in an Ast of Faith then celebrated, three Men, Hebrews by
Birth, and called new christiam, were delivered over by the Inquifitors to
the secular Court for Judaism, of which they were conviCted ; who, persisting
in the Negative‚ affirmed before the Inquisitors that they were Christians.
And being brought before the secular Judges, and interrogated concerning
the F aith, would make no Answer ς upon which they were delivered over to
>the Officers to be burnt alive, and were accordingly burnt alive

How the P R o c E s s ends agairss a Fugitive H E R E T 1 c rt.

’ F the accused Person be a Fugitive, after he is waited for a competentniresh
Time, he is cited by the Bithop or Inquifitor in the Cathedral Church osam-212}

¹that Diocese where he hath offended‚ and in other Churches ot that Place where ‘⁰²²¹‘ ‘³9'
he lived, and particularly from whence he made his Escape, personally to ap-
,pear on a certain Day in such a Cathedra] Church of such a Diocese‚ there to
hear, upon a certain Hour, his definitive Sentence before them, to which they
add, whether he appears or not, that they will proceed against him to a defini-
tive Sentence, as Law and Justice require. This Citation is fixed upon the Gates
of the Cathedral Church. In this Citation some Delay is granted, viz. of
thirty Days‚ and that is peremptory‚ so that this single one serves lor three, in
which the Criminal is cited to all and singular the Proceedings of his Trial.

lf the Criminal doth not appear, his Contumacy is complained of in the
several Terms of the Edist, and the Fifcal of the Inquifition puts in his Bill
of Accusation, after which the Process is carried on according to Course of
Law, observing the Custom and Laws of the holy Office. &Vhen all this is
finished‚ if the Crime really appears, Sentence is pronounced against the
Criminal whenever the Process is rightfu'lly and legally determined. If he
bath been informed against for Heresy, he is declared an obstinate Heretick‚
and as such left to the secular Arm. If informed against as one suspected of
Heresy, and if excommunicated, because he would not appear, and ifremain-

ing under the Sentence of Excomnlixpnication for a Year, heis not pronounci
