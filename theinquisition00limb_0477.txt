So Gregory IX. ordained in one of his Extravagants against the Patarenes, be-

who hold private Conventicles, or who differ in their Life and Manners from’the Con-
versation of the Faithfhl, let hini endeavour to disccver them to his Confeffor, or some
one else, who he believes may give Notice to the Prelate‚ otherwise let him be excom-
municated. And this Obligation of informing against Hereticks is so strist,
that it takes place notwithstanding any Oath‚ Covenant, or Promise to the
contrary. But if the Wife only should happen to know that her Husband eats
Flelh on forbidden Days‚ and knows him to be so furious, as that probably he
would murther or abuse her, if the informed against him, some think her
Fear may excuse her from the Suspicion of Heresy. But we shall speak more
fully of the Obligation to inform in the following Book.

The Council of Narbonne hath determined the several WayS‚ by which any
one may be said to be a Favourer of Hereticks. Cap. 14, 15, 16. We account
those equally Favourers of Hereticks, who obstruit the Extirpation or CorreHion of
Hereticks or their Believers, and those who don’t give that Affistance to it, which
they can’t omit without a manifest Fault. But such Persons may be more or ἰώ guilty

i'n theſs,² Mamers, from a careful Confideration of Circumstances. He, for Instance‚
greatly favours Hereticks or their Believers who conceals them, when he may, and

= ought to discover them. He favours them more, who by concealing them, or other-
l wise maliciousty endeavours to prevent their Examination or Imprisonment, or Punifh-
⁴ ment. He most of all, who releases those who are apprehended or itnprisoned, with-

out the Churches Leave·, or if such ‘Thin-gs are done by his Counsel, Helo, Com..
“mand or Care. But he is above all others to be accounted guilty of this Crime, who
having temporat Jurisdic‘tion, defers to persecute these aforesaid pestiferous Hereticks‚
or Persons declared to be Rebels against the Church‚ or to extirminate them out of his
Country or Province, or to animadvert against them without Delay, Such a one is
justly to be fitspetied of being joined in wicked Society with them, who negleets to puta
Stop to fh greata Wz'ckedmss, after having received the proper Information by the
Church or otherwifi,⁹ ·‚ stnce he both may do it, and is bound to it ·, especially if he is
under the Obligation of an Oath to do it. But neither are they free from this Crime,

κ who, when they have the Opportunity of Time and Place, and Leave to apprehend

Hereticks, or the aforesaid Rebels, and to affist those who are to take them up, wicked-

l ly negleit it ·‚ especially cf required hy those who apprehend them, or are willing to do it,

And fince there are many, and almost unsearchahle Methods of doing Harm, by which
Hereticks, their Believers and Favourers endeavour to destroy the Vineyard of the
Lord of Sabaoth, which ought to be prudently and vigorously opposed, let your Piety
take Care, according to the Grace given you of the Lord, to find out thefi’ Evils, and

apply the wholesome Remedy ς and letyour Prudence make up what can't fh eafily be
committed to Writing.

Lastly‚ Friar Ivonetus describes· the Marks and Signs, by which Persons
may be known to be F avourers of Hereticks. There is extant a Volume OleSy
the Fragment of which is in a Parchment Book of the Vatican Libram, Hm·
