26 The Hm-onv of the INQursrmon.

“ Another of the Vineyard let out to the Husbandrnen. The third of the
“ Nuptial Feast prepared for those who were invited. By these he plainly
“ Ihews, that the Kingdom was to be taken away from the heretical Jews, ands·
“ their City to be burnt with Fire. See here now the very Confiscation ofEf.
‘⁶ fects, and Fire with which Hereticks are punished.” Nor is this Reasoning
to be wondered at in a Man, who every where in the Old and New Testament,'
and even in Paradise it self, finds out an Inquifition against Hereticks, and en·
deavours to prove by many ArgumentS, that God himself exercised the Office
oflnquifitor of heretica] Pravity against Adam in Paradise, lib. 1. tit. 2.] The
first who ordained this Punilhrnent of burning Hereticks, after it had been
some time in Use in the Church of Rome, was Frederick II. by a Law
which begins, Inconfinilem. ᾗ. 4. which says: By the Tenor of this present Law,
we decree, thatthe Patarenes, ana' all other Hereticks whatsoever, being condemned,¹⁴
fhall snffir that Death which they affea‘l, and that being committed to the Flames, they
shall be barm alive in the View of all Men. This Law manyPopes have con-v
firmed, and therefore the Punishment ofFire hath been ordinarily inflicted up-
on impenitent Hereticks, as is the Custom ofthe Church of Rome to this Day.
Fanornzilanns says ἐξ, that Hereticks ought to be punished with Fire, and burm, and
that in this the Divine, Canon, Civil, and Common Law agree. Simancas also †
not only endeavours to prove by many Arguments, that Hereticks ought tou
be burnt, because Heathens and Hereticks thus puniffied the Catholicks‚ as
Eusebius, Rnffinns, Socrates and others testify ·‚v but contends that 'tis the most an-
tie'nt Punilhrnent, as appears from the Acts ofthe Council of Chalcedon ; because
the Bishop of Alexandria is there reported to have said, If Eutiches pretends to
hewiser in his Opinions than the Church‚ he is not only worthy of punish*
ment, but to be burnt·‚ and because, as Nicephorus, Eccles. Hzst. Book 180.
Chap, 4. relates, they ordered Anatolius the Heretick, to be burnt alive.
322 cathol Simancas also infers this Puniihment from a certain Law of Theodostus, say-
thstitg ²2⁵5· im, that Ts‘seoaostm published a constitution, in which are these Things. Far--
40· 9· 48, &Zona-e rme cau-mazaei, that whofoever shall bring over a Servant or Freeman unwil-
lingly, or by Panasion, to the wicked δεξί’, or Ceremony from the Christian War-
fhz'p, shall lest heah his Fortnne and his Head. And a little after, Let him farther
know, that his (ἱερεῖς shall be fmfez'ted, and afterwards he himself put to Death, who
shall pervert any one from the Faz'th hy false Dobi‘rine³ Simancas adds, A Law iruly
worthy of aSpanish Emperor. Vid. Cod. Theodos. Tit. de Judaeis L. prima.&
lib. 16, tit. 6. l. 55.
§a 523. So that Hereticks-must be punished with Fire, and if that can't be done,
’ they must at least be banished and expelled, and their Effects forfeited, agree-
able to the Laws ofthe old Gothick Kings in Spain, by which the Goods offic-⁷
retlcks wer-e confiscated, and they themselves deprived of Honour and Dignities,
and banished for ever2.
With this Punishment of Fire only Hereticks relapsed, obstinate and impe-
nitent are punished, wh0, after Sentence, are delivered over to the secular*
