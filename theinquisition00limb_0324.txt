C H A P. XXX*

Of the INQUISITION in Spain agaiissHERE‘rmKs.

HE Tribunal of the Inquifition in Spain, at first ereeted to discover

Jews and Moors‚ now began to proceed against Hereticks‚ and exercised

the same Cruelty against these, as they had hitherto against the others.
Charles V. King of Spain, who with great Difficulty had brought the Inqui-
fition into the Necherlauds against the Lutherans and Reformed‚ recommended it
to his Son Philip in his Will. We have the Clause of the Will given us by Cae-
sar Carena, from Lewis Paramm, in his Treatise of the Office of the most
holy Inquifition, Praelud. ᾗ. 62. in which the Emperor thus speaks: Out
of Regard to my Duty to Almighty God, and from my great Affebiion to the
most strene Prince Philip II. my dearest Son, and from the strong and earnest De-
stre I have, that he may he safe under the Proteftion of Virtue‚ rather than the
Greatness of his Riche5‚ I charge him with the greatest AffeHion of Soul, that he
take especial Care of all ‘Things relating to the Honour and Glory of God, as becomes
the most Catholick King, anda Prince zealous for the divine Command5; and that
he be always obedient to the Commands of our holy Mother the Church. And, amongst
other Thing5‚ this I principally and most ardently recommend to him, highly to honour
and constantly support the Office of the holy Inquisttion‚ as constituted h God against
heretical Pravity‚ with its Ministers and Officials, because by this single Remedy the
most grievous Offences against God can be remedied. Alfi) I command him, that he
would he caresul to preserve to all Churches and ecclefiastical Persons their Immani-
ties. And again in his Codicil to his Will he thus enjoins his Son. Iardently
destre, and with the greatest poffihle Earnestness heseech him, and command him by
his Regards to me his most affeffz'ionate Father, that in this Matter, in which the
lVeffare of all Spain is concerned, he he most zealously careful‚ to punish all in-
fefflaed with Heresy with the Severity due to their Crimes, ancl that to this Intent‚ he
confer the greatest Honours on the Office of the holy Inquisition‚ by the Care of which
the Catholick Faith will be encreascd in his Kingdoms,and the Christian Religion preserved.
Dc nel. Philip gave full Proof of his Zeal to execute his Father's Commands. For
nel. Deca‘as Famianus Strada testifies of him, when he was requested by many to grant
