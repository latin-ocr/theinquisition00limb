Faith in the Netherlands‚ and France‚ a Man of an austere Temper‚ supported
by the Royal Authority ommis, who commanded him to burn many who
were inseeted with Heresy. But when afterwards the said Friar, according to
Mat. Paris, under the Year 1236. abused the Authority given him, and trans-
greffed the Bounds of Modesty and Justice‚ growing haugffly, powerful and
terrible, condemning to the same Puniffiment the Innocent as well as Guilty,
he was put out of his Office by the Pope's Order, and shut up in perpetual
Imprisonment. Afterwards Fulco exercised the {ame Severity in Lmgywdov, Du cange,
upon Account of whose exceffive Cruelty‚ Philip the Friar sent in the Yearz‘btd.
1301. certain Persons to enquire into his Mismanagement, and ordered that
for the future those who were suspe&ed of Heresy should be put in the Royal
Prisons at Tholoust’, and that the King’s Subiects should not be detained by the
Inquisltor’s Decree, without the Bishop's Advice first had, and the Affistance
of the Royal Seneschal. It would have been well if these two Persons only had
exceeded the Bounds of just Judgment; but in Reality this was the Fault of
most of them. And therefore, that the Minds of Men might not be too
much exasperated‚ they added some of the Order of the Friars Minors to the
Predicant5‚ by their Gentleness to temper the others Rigour. This was ac‘tu-
ally done in the Year 1238.

And indeed this Tribunal of the Inquifition was the fittest Method in the
World for Persons to oppress their Enemies, under the Pretence that they
were infected with Heresy, and was abused to this Purpose by political Men as
well as Ecclefiasticks, if it be true what Raynczld writes of the Emperor Frede- Ῥ ¹233·
rick, that he was greedy of Revenge‚ and used by various Pretences and Sub- 9· 33, 34·
ornation of Crimes‚ to rage against those, whom he inwardly hated. To this
Purpose he pretended great Zeal to cut off Hereticks‚ and appointed that Apud
in all the Provinces and Places of Note there should be a Judge, together (negorz
with a Prelate, to take Cognizance of the Examination of Persons by Torture 3 Ep* ²4³⁹
and sor this pious Precaution‚ as it appeared, he was commended by Pope
Gregory. But he improved this to gratify his Revenge‚ causing many inno-
cent Catholicks, who had incurred his Displeasure, to be accused of Heresy,
and burnt alive, to the great Grief and Offence of all·, insomuch that Gre- Ep. 2440
gory gravely admonished him, that he should endeavour to extirpate Hereticks,
and not destroy the Catholicks.

However‚ the Roman Pontiffs did much more insolently abuse their Power.
For they were not afraid to brand with the Name of Heresy, and to proceed
against as Hereticks, Kings and Princes‚ and even the Emperor himself, is
they would not own their unbounded Power‚ and do every thing according to
their Beck. Of this we have a famous Instance in the Emperor Frederick .· He
had made very severe Laws against Hereticks, greatly increased the Authority of
the Inquifition, and in the Year 1236. having found some Persons at Palem-e Raynald.
