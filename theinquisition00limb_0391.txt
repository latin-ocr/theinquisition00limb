de haeret. Valentinian and Martian concerning Eutyches and his Books. l. quiam,
ς. Nulli. and Omnes. c. de haeret. Justinian ordained the cutting off the Hand
, of those who wrote out the Books of Antimus‚ condemned in the fifth Sy·l. ac, 6
ξ nod. And ’tis worth Observation what Brunus says concerning Hereticl<s§.2. ’
and Schismaticks 3 ‘That it appears to have been a most ancient Custom cf the
' Church, that when Hercsses were condemned, their eritings fhoula' be destroyed,
from hence ; that ofall the Herestes‚ which for a long Time continued in the Church,
the Books containing them are now no where extant, and tloe Opinions of most of
them would have been altogether unknown, unless the Renzembrance of them had
been preserved in the Writings of the holy Fathers, who endeavoured to confute
them.

All these Laws against the Books of Hereticks were made by Emperors
, who had the legissative Power in their Empire. [⁶⁶ But after the Yeaerst. cen.
“ 800, the Popes of Rome usurped to themselves many Branches of the ci-Trfd· l· ὁ·
“ vil Government, forbidding the Reading of Books, and commandingp· 5ῗὲ-
» “ them to be burnt, after they had condemned the Authors of thern 3 but till
“ this very Age, there are but very few Books found, that are prohibited
‘⁸ after this Manner: At least, the universal Prohibition of reading Books,
Ἴ “ containing heretica] Doctrine, or suspected of Heresy, under the Penalty
’ “ of Excommunication, without any other preceding Sentence, had not yet
‘⁸ grown into Praffice.”] But after that the Pope had arrogated to himself the
Judgment of the Faith, and order'd himself to be acknowledged the infal-
lible Judge of all Controverfies of the Faith, he also assumed to himselfall
Judgment concerning Books, and the Power of prohibiting them. From this
Claim of Power have sprung those expurgatory Indexes, by which, not on-
ly the Books of such' Authors as are condemned by the Church of Rome are
prohibited, but the Writings of all, even of the greatest Romanists themselves,
are subjeeted to a Censure ·‚ and whatsoever is 'found in them contrary to the
opinions of the Roman Church, or not altogether agreeable to them, is
marked with a †, and commanded to be blotted ουκ jand every Place
is so carefully noted, that no one can be ignorant, what Words are to be
erased. So that ifthe Popes Command, as contained in that Index, is to be
oberved ; we shall read no Books as written by the Authors„ nor have their
Sense, but only that of the Court-of Rome. [“ Pope Martin V. by his Bull Hass. cm,
“ excommunicated all Sects of Hereticks‚ but especially the chlefists and frid. ⁴26·
‘⁸ Huffites·, but without any Mention of those who read their Books, astho’p· 551-
“ they were in the Hands of a great many. But Leo X. having condemned
‘⁸ Luther, forbid also all his Books to be read under Pain of Excommuni-
“ cation. The Popes after him, by the Bull, In caena, condemned and ex-
“ communicated all Hereticks, and therein devoted also to the same Curses,
“ allthose who read their Books. And in other Bulls, against Hereticks in
‘⁸' general, did thunder out the same terrible Sentences against the Readers
“ of those Books. This occafioned a very great Confufion: For as the
“ Names of the Hereticks who were condemned were not published, Per-

ζξ sons were to judge of the BookS, rather from the Nature of t(t‘hg. Do·-
