Persons excommunicated, and Partakers, and Perfhns guilty ofthesczme C rime, fhall be
admitted to bear W itneſs, especially when there is a Deficiency of other Proofs against
Hereticks, their Believers, Favourers, Receivers, and Defenders, if it mav be
prefiimed from probable Conjeblures, and the Number of theffes, or Qiczlity ofthe
Perfhns, as well those who depose, as these who are deposed against, that such [Vitnes-
ses do not spenkfalsely. In this the Council os Biterre agrees, Cap. 12. Altho' in
this Crime all Criminals and infametis Persons, and those who are Partakers of their
Guilt, may be admitted as Accusers and lVitneffes. The Decree of Alexander IV.
is to the same Purpose, An. 1261. Feb. 1. beginning, Consuluit nos.
‘Next to Persons excommunicated are joined Hereticks, Jews, and hfidels, pogna, rb.

as Witness'es, an Herctick '1s not allowed as a 'Witness lor one of the Faithful.
But isan Heretick, whether in Prison or elsewhere, charges one ofthe Faith-
ful, or one who is esteemed as such, with the Crime os Heresy, or as a Par-
taker ofhis Crime, tho’ this doth not amount to half Proof, so as to occafion
his being apprehended‚ yet it is Discovery enough to proceed to a secret Inqui-
fition against him. But, as was said, the Testimony of an Heretick against an
Heretick‚ is admitted, but not for an Heretick. They affirm the same of a
Jew and an Infidel, wh0‚ when they are admitted as Witnesses, must not
swear upon the Gospels as Christians d0‚ but according to their own Laws.
Inlike manner the Testimony ofa Wife, Sons and Daughters, or Dome-
sticks, against Persons accused of Heresy, is allowed, but by no Means in
their Favour and Behalf. C. Filii, de haeret. lib. 6. The Reason Simancas Tit.64;
gives, why Kindred are admitted as Witnefl‘es against Kindred, is, because §- 47- ,
they can’t poffibly be suspeffitecl. Yea, some add, that when other Proofs carena,
are wanting, the Judge may compel not only a Brother, but even a Wife, οῖς, {⁰1} ς’
Son, to witness against a Father. Servants also may be tortured against their
Masters.
Even perjured Persons, who having taken an Oath before the Inqui-
fitors to speak the Truth, have forsworn themselves by concealing it,
l and would afterwards correct themselves, and swear back again against
l themselves and others, are to be admitted, if it plainly appears that they
ἶ a& not from Levity ofMind, nor the Instigation of Enmity, nor from being
corrupted by Money, but from their Zeal for the Orthodox Faith, and
that on this Account they would discover in Favour os the Faith what they
had concealed before, according as Alexander IV. hath decreed, and as may
be found in the VI. of the Decretals. And altho’ perjured Persons are not
allowed as Witnesses even after Repentance, yet ’tis quite different in a Cause
of the Faith; and the D06tors observe, that such a one’s second Depofition
must be stood to, when hereby he discovers the Crime of Heresy. But if
when he takes his second Oath, he denies what he deposed concerning He-
resy when he took his first, the firi} Depofition must be stood t0, and nfot
