secular Justice comes to 'them and claims them. If any of them are in holy
Orders, they are degraded, and deprived ot all their Orders, before they are
delivered to the secular- Arm. After this they read the Sentences against the

[ἔγ. Geddes, who himself was once present at it. His Words are these: “ The Prisoners are no

‘ sooner in the Hands of the Civil Magistrate‚ than they are loaded with Chains, before the

“ Eyes of the Inquifitors‚ and being carried first to the secular Jayl, are, within an Hour or two,
“ brought from thence, before the Lord Chief Justice, who, without knowing any Thing of
⁴‘ their particular Crimes, or of the Evidence that was against them, asks them one by one} In
“ what Religion they do intend to die ?· tf they answer‚ That they will die in the Communion of
“ the Church of Rome, they are condemned by him, To be carried sorthwnh to the Place os Execu-
“ tion, and there to be first flranfgled, and afterwards burm to Afhes. But if they say, They wtll die
⁴‘ in the Protqstant, or in any other Faith that is contrary to the Roman, they are then sentenced
“ by him, ib bf carried sorthwith to the Place qf execution, and there to be burm alive.
