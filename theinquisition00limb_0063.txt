&Visdom kept in tolerable Peace and Order. The Bishops which had been Soc. ις,
banished hy Constantius his Predeceffor, he immediately recalled, ordered their c, ¹·
Effests, which had been confiscated, to be restored to them, and commanded

that no one should injure or burt an)⁷ Christian whatsoever. And as Ammianus
Marcellinus, an heathen Writer osthose Times, tells us, he caused the Christian 1. ι’.. c. ς..
Bistiops and People, who were at variance with each other, to corne into his
Palace, and there admonished them, that they should every one profess their

own Religion, without Hindrance or Fear, provided they did not disturb the
publick Peace by their Divisions„ This was an Instance os great Moderation

and Generosity‚ and a Pattern worthy the Imitation ofall his Succeffors.

Iu the beginning ofJulian’s Rcign some of the Inhabitants os Alexandria, Soc. l. 3.
and, as was reported, the Friends osAthanastus‚ by his Advice, raised a greatc·¹ .²,² 3' 4·
Tumult in the City, and murthered Geor-ge, the Bishop ofthe Place, by taring him Enssmst'lff'
in pieceS, and burning his Body 3 upon which Athanafius returned immediately “ “
from his Banishment, and took Pofleffion ofhis See, turning out the Arians from
their Churches, and forcing them to hold their Assemblies in private and mean
Places. Julian, with great Equity, severely reproved the Alexandriam for this
their Violence and Cruehy, telling them, that though George might have
greatly injured them, yet they ought not to have revenged themselves on him,
but to have left him to the Justice of the Laws. Albana-fias, upon his Resto-
ration, immediately convened a Synod at Alexandria, in which was first assert-
ed the Divinity of the Holy Spirit, and his Consubstantiality with the Father
and the Son. But his Power there was but short 3 for being accused to Jals'anc- 130
as the Destroyer os that city, and all Egypt, he saved himself by ssight, ixit
soon after secretly returned to Alexandria, where he lived in great privacy [ flTheod.
the Storm was blown over by ‘Julian’s Deam, and the Succeffion of Jovm tol· 4- Ε· ²·
the Empire, who restored him to his See, in which he continued undisturbed to
his Death.

Although Julian behaved himself with great Moderation‚ upon his first Ac-
cession to the imperial Dignity, towards the Christians, as well as others, yet
his Hatred to Christianity soon appeared in many Instances. For though he
did not, like the rest ofthe Heathen EmperorS‚ proceed to sanguinary Laws, Soc. [ης.
yet he commanded, that the Children of Christians should not be instrufted in ⁰· ¹420*st
the Grecian Language and Learning. By another Edi& he ordained, That no
Christianffhould bear any Office in the Army, nor have any Concern in the Di-
stribution and Management of the publick Revenues. He taxed very heavily, Theoti, γ
and demanded Contributions from all who would not sacrifice, to support thelgjjcf³
vast Expences he was at in his Eastern Expeditions. And when the Governors θ’·
ofthe Provinces took Occasion from hence to oppress and plunder them, he
dismissed those who complained with· this scornfuernswess Your God bath com-
manded you to fitffer Persecution J He also deprived the Clergy of all *their Immu-
nities, Honours‚ and Revenues‚ granted them by Constantine, abrogated the
Laws made in their Favour, and ordered they should be listed amongst the
Number of Soldiers. He destroyed several of their Churches, and stripped ·
them os their Treasure and sacred Veffels. Some he punissied with Baniur-
