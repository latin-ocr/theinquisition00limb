How the PRocnss begins by Acczffation.

‘N J H E N the Accuser reports to the Inquifitor any Crime committed by

another, and the Accusation hath the Appearance of Truth, they
proceed in this Mamer, according to the Instruffion of Eymerick‚ which hath
been long observed. First the Inquisitor inquires, whether the Accuser will
accuse, and proceed in the Affair by way ofAccusation, or not ? If he says
he will proceed by way of Accusation, he is to be admonissied by the Inquisi-
τος, that he renders himselfliable to the Punishment of Retaliation‚ unless his
67, Proof be good. But this Method of Proceeding the inquisitor must not eafb-
ly. allow, because 'tis not customary in a Cause of the Faith, and because 'tis
very dangerous, and greatly difficult to the Accuser. But if the Accuser per-
fists, he must give his Accusation in Wrsting, which must be written by the
Notary, in order to begin the Process, But others contend, that in the Crime
of Heresy ’tis not necessary that a Person should oblige himself to the Law of

Retaliation. And as they now seldom admit the Person of an Accuser, they

have constituted a publicki Minister, whom they call the Fiscal, who sustains

the Person of the Accuser, and accuses the Criminals, who doth not obliget
himself to the Punishment of Retaliation‚ nor any others which false Accu-²-
sers usuall suffer.

'2121' Formeryly, when the Process was carried on at-the Instance of the Accuser,
after the Accusation was made before the Inquifitor, the Inquisitor command=
ed the Accuser to produce the Names of his Witneffes, who being cited by the>
inquisitor, are striffly examined upon Oath. If what they depose doth no·
thing concern the Fast, the Inquifitor must advise the Accuser, to withdraw-‘⁸2'
the Word Accusation, and put in the Room of it Denunciation, that so the
Inquisitor may proceed Ex officio, and not at the Instance of the Party, be·-
cause so very dangerous to the Accuser. But if the Proosof the Witneffes-
be full, the Inquifitor produces them, and giving them their Oaths upon the
four Gospels to declare the Truth, which he can oblige them to take if they
refuse it, strictly examines thern in ajudicial Manner before the Notary and'

two religious Persons, or otherwise reputable„ Then he interrogatesthem
