The H1sromc of the INQUISrT-'IONJ 16⁷7·

The same Synod commands, That in Provincial or Synodical Councils‚ a proper
Remedy shall be provided, bestdes the forementioned Penalty,· against ficch negligens
Persons, according to the Degree of such Fault or Negligcnce,⁴ all Privileges, Ex-
emptions‚ Customs and Statutes whatsoever to the contrary notwithstanding. But Ι
am persuaded that few offend against this Decree, or incur the Penalty os
Suspenfion by Negligence or Lenity ·, fince all Compaffion is banished from
this T ribunal, and fince all who are promoted to this office-'of Inquifitor im-
mediately divest themselves, Ι will not say of all Pity only, but even of Hu-
millsltthe'thiiqlgiziitors offend, by unjustly extorting Money‚ it was ancientlypegQ in

from their Offices such Inquisttors and Commzſjaries as are found guilty, and when Com. ω·
removed, otherwise to punish and correo}⁸ them according to their Defert. But now
as the Prelates of the several Orders neither appoint or remove Inquifitorss
so neither do they punish them; but the Affair is referred to the Cardinals·x
Inquifitors General in Christendom. In Spain the Prefident of the inquisition,-
whom they call Inquifitor Major, punishes the delinquent Inquifitors‚ which

of all Kingdoms at the Court of Rome 3 for heis the Jhdge of all, and the In-·
quisitors are delegated by him, and because it appertains to him to take·
Cognisance of· their Causes, and punish their Offences. And if= any others take?
Gognisance of these Affairs‚ they doit by aPower derived from the Pope„
which he cignfresume as often as he thinks fit, and bring. the whole Affair·
. fore him el .
beWhen any Inquifitor is to be puniihed for his Offence, they take Care not
tolessen Mens Opinion of the Dignity and Authority of the holy Office by·
his Condemnation or Punishment‚ which they say is more dangerous than·
tosuffer an Offendor to go unpunilh’d3 unless· it be such an Offence as·
gives Scandal‚ and therefore must not be passed over with Impunity„ And
they alledge this Reason 3 That the Apostolick Inquifitors are both dreaded
and hated‘¹ by many, and especially by wicked Men; and therefore if they
should be easily or publickly punilhed‚ the foolish and mad People would
soonbe drawn by their Crimes to hate and dishonour the holy Office. So that·
when there is a Neceflity to punish the Inquifflors, it must be done with Cau·
tion, to prevent greater Inconveniences.

However‚ from these Laws it is very plain, that the Tribunal of the Ina

ry unjustly, throwing them into Prison‚- and treating them in a very barba·
rous and unworthy Manner. Of this we have a fresh Instance in the Inqui- ’raven-n,
fition at Goa, in relation to Father Ephraim, a Capucine‚ whom out of merewavelsg*
Hatred and Revenge they seized, by Craft and Subtlety, and carried &BC-15·
away to Goa‚- and these shut him up in the Prison of· the inquisition. ςἨκῑ
