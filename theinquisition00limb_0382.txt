The Hrs‘roav ofthe INQUISITION.

One may easily infer from this Doctrine of Sozffa, what the Subje&s of Great
Britain, and other Kingdoms and States must expefl, if all Things are to be
done according to the Pleasure of the Inquisitors, and how little Saiety they
will find by such Treaties against the Violence of the lnquifitors, unless
they are protected by the Authority of their King, against these their vile and
unrighteous Praetices„ [Of this we have a noble Instance given us by Oliver
Cromwd, Protector of Englcmci. Thomas Mamerd, Consul of the English Na-
tion at Lisbon, was thrown into the Prison of the Inquisltion, under Pretence
that he had said or done something against the Roman Religion. M. Mea-
(ἴσως, who was then Refident, and took Care oi the Englzfh Affairs at Lisbon‚
advised Cromwel of the Affair3 and after having received an Express from
him, went to the King of Portugal‚ and in the Name of Crmnwel, demand-
ed the Liberty of Consul Maynard. The King told him, 'twas not in his

Power, that the Consul was detained by the Inquifition, over which he had

no Authority. The Refident sent this Answer to Cromwel, and having soon
after received new Instructions from him, had again Audience of the King,
and told him, That since his Majesty had declared he had no Power over
the VInquifitiom he was commanded by Cromwel, to declare War against the
Inquisition. This unexpecsted Declaration so terrified the King and the Inqui-
fition, that they immediately determined to free the Consul from Prison 3 and
immediately opened the Prison Doors, and gave him Leave to go out. The
Consul refused to accept a private Dismiffion, but in order to repair the Ho-
nour of his Character, demanded to be honourably brought forth by the In-
quilition. The same Maynard continu’d many Years after under the same
Charaeter, in the Reigns of charles and James II. and liv’d at Lisbon till he
was about eighty Years old, without any Molestation from the Inquifition.
This Story was well known to all foreign Merchants, who lived at that
Time, and many Years after at Lisbon]

Osthe Power of the INQJISITORS.

HAT the Inquifitor may discharge his Duty without any Hindrance‚
T Power is given him to compel the Governors of Cities to sware that
they will defend the Church against Hereticks. We ordain moreover, that

’ the Earls‚ Barons, Governors and Consuls cf Cities audather Places, shall take their
us- corporal Oath at the Admonition of the Bishop‚ andsweczr that they will faithfully‚

effetfi‘ually andfincerely affist the Church, according to their Office and utmost Power,
against Herelicks and their Accomplices, when required by the Bzfhops .· And tf
they refuse to do this, let them be deprived of that Honour which they poffess, and
never be raised to any other. Let them farther be excommunicated, and their
