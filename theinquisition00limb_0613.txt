And in order the more effeetually to prevent all Danger to the Witneffes,
which may asise from their being known, Camillus Campegizss advises, not only
to suppress their Names, but even all Circumstances that may tend to point:
out or discover them. For he says he thath ostentimes seen that the gramina
such aCopy hath given Rise to Enmities, Hatreds, XVounds and Death 3 anfi
sometimes, that those under Inquifition, falsely imagining a Person to have
deposed against them, who hath not, nor said or did any Thing against them,
have notwithstanding, thro' such a false Persuas10n‚ contrived not only great-⁷
ly to injure him, but even his Destruetion. Thus it happened at Feriam, and
at other PlaceS, as he says he was credibly informed. And therefore he ad-
vises the Inquifitors, to proceed very caudously in this Affair‚ and so to de·
send the Catholici< Faith‚ as to secure the Lives of the Witneffes. For he
says there are few to be found, who are willing to inform or depose in this»
Cause of Hereticks, and that if the Safety of the Witneffes should be endan-
gered by the World, he imagines there would not be so much as a fingle ln-
f rmer.

0 When any just Exceptions are objthed against the Witneffes, the Crimi-
nal is admitted to prove them. But his Witnesses are so cautiously examined,
as if poffible to prevent their knowing who the Witnesses against the Criminal
are. And, in order to this, they are interrogated not only concerning the
Enmity or Conspiracy of the real Witneffes against the Criminal, but of
others also who are not Evidences against him.

But here I· cannot omit, what J. Royas says, ‘⁶ That by suppreffing theam. 2.
“ Names of the Witneffes‚ Criminals are deprived of the full Means of making Afffft· 4·
“ their Defence‚ and by Consequence it must be very imperfeft and maimed,
⁸‘ For which way can the accused Person, kept secretly in, Jayl, and dep-fi..
‘4 ved ofthe Comfort and Affistance of his Friends and Relations‚ and Pro-
“ curators, either object the Defects osthe Evidence‚ or thejust Exceptions
“ against the Witneffes, if he is ignorantof their Name5‚ if they should hap-
“ pen to be his Enemie8‚ or Criminals themselves, or infirmous, or excom-
“- municated, or otherwise uncapable? For, in so heinous a Crime, punish,
“ ed with all Kinds os Punishments‚ viz. Excommunication‚ Forfeiture -
“· of Estate, the Delivery of the Person to the secular Arm, his own and
“· his Family’s perpetu-al Infamy, stronger Proofs are necessary than in other
⁰³·- Crimes. Nor canit be rash to affert, that the Witnefl'es, whose Names
“- are not-discovered„ cannot be, as to the Criminal‚ above Exception ·‚ be·
“· cause he cannot obje& any Thing against them, when he doth not know
“ them. They only are said to be beyond all Exception, who cannot be re-s-
“= je&ed as Witneffes by anyjtast Exception made against them3 and there-
“ fore, as in this Case, one solemn Usage of the Law is over-ruled by sup-
“ preffing their Names, there is no Room to urge against them Crimes‚ De-
“ fens, and Objedlions. But afterwards, as I considered the Words of the
“ Extravagant of Innocent VI. Thatfztll Credit shall lm nevertlwlfi given so what ·
“ such Wieneffes say, I am, upon this Account, ready to recant. However,
fi} in my poor Opinion, 1 should not dare to condemn any one is there‘were
