oi the London Pastors and Curates to appear before him at Lambeth‚ andimme-
diately suspended Thirty seven, who refused to subscribe to the Unity of'Ap-
parel, and fignified to them, that within three Months they should be totally
deprived if they would not conform. So that many Churches were shut up·‚
and though the People were ready to mutiny for want of Ministers, yet the
Archbishop was deas to all their Complaints, and in his great Goodness and
Piety was resolved they should have no Sacraments or Sermons without the
Surplice and the Cap. And in order to prevent all Oppofition to Church
Tyranny, the star Chamber publiihed a Decree for Sealing up the Press, and
prohibiting any Person to print or publilh any Book against the Qeen’s In-
iunffions, or against the Meaning of them. This Decree was figned by the
‘Bishops os Cantaba-try and London.

This rigid and fanatical Zeal for Habits and Ceremonies, caused the Puri-
tans to separate from the Establilhed Church, and to hold private Affemblies
for Worship. But the Qeen and her Prelates soon made them feel their Ven-
geance. Their Meetings were disturbed‚ and those who attended them ap·
prehended, and sent in large Numbers, Men and Women, to Bridewell, for
ConviCtion. Others were cited into the Spiritual Courts, and not dischargod
till after long Attendance and great Charges.. Subscriptions to Articles of
Faith were violently preffed upon the Clergy, and about one Hundred of
them were deprived, Anno 1572. for refufing to submit rothem. Some were
closely imprisoned, and died in Gaol, through Poverty and Want. And that
serious Piety, and Christian Knowledge might gain Ground, as well as Uni-
formity, the Bishops, by order of the Qeen, put down the Prophesyings of
the Clergy, Anno 1574. who were forbid to affemble, as they had done sor
some Years, to discourse with one another upon religious Subjefits and Ser-
mons ·, and as some serious Persons of the Laity were used to meet on Holy
DayS, or aster they had done work, to read the ScriptureS, and to improve
themselves in Christian Knowledge ·, the Parsons of the Parishes were sent for,
and ordered to suppress them. Eleven Dutch Men, who were Anabaptists‚
were condemned in the Confistory of St. Paul to the Fire, for Heresy ς nine
of whom were baniss‘oed, and two os thern burnt alive in Smithfield. In the
Year 1583. Copping and Thacker, two Puritan Ministers, were hanged for
Non—Consormity. It would be endless to go through all the Severities
that were used in this Reign upon the Account ofReligion. As the Qeenwas
of a very high and arbitrary Temper, she preffed Uniformity with great
Violence‚ and found Bishops enough, Parker, Aylmer, Whitgift, and others,
to justisy and promote her Measures 3 who either enter’d their Sees with per·
secuting Principles‚ or embraced them soon after their Entrance, as best be-
fitting the Ends oftheir Promotion. Silencings, Deprivations, Imprisonments,
Gibbets, and Stakes, upon the Account oi Religion, were some of the pow-
erful Reasonings os those Times. The Bishops rioted in Power, and many of
thern abused it to the most cruel Oppreffions. The Cries of innocent Priso-
ners, widowed Wives, and starving Children, made no Impreffion on their
HeartS. Piety and Learning with them were void* of Merit. Refusal of
