The Haut-om ofthe INQUISITION.

Our Saviour sent his Disciples like Sheep into the midst of VVolves, in or-
der to bear Testimony to the Gospel by their Patience under Suffedngs,
and hereby spread the divine Savour of it through the World. It was
far from his Design‚ that likeVVolves they ssiould tear and devour the Sheep ·‚
or that they should violently compel those by the Terrors of Torments and
Death to embrace his Religion, whom they could not gain by the Foree
of Arguments ε Belides, all agree that Faith is the Gift 0fG0d‚ and there<
fore can never be produced by human Force3 nor can God be pre-
vailed on by external Violence to communicate this his excellent Gift. The
Mind >is to be convinced by Arguments 3 the Tongue and bodily Members
may be forced by external Violence 3 but this can never extort from any one a
real Belief of that to be true, which he is perswaded in his Mind is false: So
that nothing can be more direffly opposite to the Genius of Christianity‚
than to persecute the Erroneous ; to expose thern under the infamous Narne
of Hereticks to the Fury of the Mob‚ and punilh them with a cruel
Death.

Nor are we to think, thatOthese gentle Means of propagating Christianity·

Rulers, upon their Conversion to the Faith, are obl’iged to subjeff² their
Scepters to Jesus Christ ι For the Change of F ortune makes no Change in his
Religion 3 nor can the Alteration of any worldly Affairs take away the F orce
and Obligation of his Commands 3 for Christ, by his Apostles, preached one
Scheme of Doctrines to last for ever. 'Tis true, that Kings are to sub-
*rnit their Scepters to Christ, not by forcing Men with Punishinents, in Op-
pofition to his Commands, to profess, contrary to their Conscience and real
,Sentiments‚ what they believe to be false, and so to fill his Church with Hy-
pocrites instead of true Believer33 but by ordaining equal and just Laws,
agreeable to the Gospel Precepts, for the Preservation of the Publick
Tranquility3 and that there may be nothing to obstruit the true spi-
ritual Worship of God, and the Salvation of Souls. This is that most harm-
less, and yet most powerful Method of propagatis-ig the Gospel, agreeable to
its Nature and Genius, by which in the BegInning, it was spread in a
{hort Time through the wholeWorld‚ by a few weak and defenceless Persons,
instrueted only by the Divine Spirit‚ through the Weight of its Arguments‚
and the Power of its Mirm-les ·. and by which it may be still propagated‚
and preserved pure and uncorrupt‚ against all the Atternpts of Unbelievers
and Hereticks ε For our Lord did not furnish his Disciples with carnal Wea=

pons to oppose the Frauds3 >Irnpostures, Violence and Persecutions of the
World, but with spiritual VVeapons‚ which through God are powert'ul to
bring every Imagination into Captivity to the Obedience of Christ, that
they might triumph over the World in the midst of Affiistiom, by their
Innocence, Simplicity, Fortitude and Patience, *So far indeed was hg ‚fer
