The HrsTORY of the INQUISITION.

‘⁶ in these Rules, if they shall think proper to do it in their Kingdoms, Pro-

The Venetiam Senate, as they defend their own Authority against the Inqui-

Power of the Inquifitors. For as Father Paul justly observes, they confider,
that the main Design of the Ecclesiastieks, is to assume to themselves a Power
to prohibit not only Books of Religion, but such as treat ofany other Matters
whatsoever3 and to deprive Princes of the Power ofprohibiting in their own
Territories any Book, ifthey have approved it, whatever be the Subjeet ‚it
treats of. The Consequenceofwhich they see would be this, that they can·
not prohibit any Book from being brought into their Dominions, and pub-
lickly sold, if the Ecclefiasticks approve of it, though it be in it selfdange-
rous to the Commonwealth. For these Reasons they have vigoroussy endea-
voured to reserve this Power to themselves, and not to suffer it to be transfer-
red to the Inquifitors. On this account great Differences arose between the
Pope and the Senate‚ and in the Year 1595. there met the Cardinal Nuncio
and the Inquifition on the Pope's Part, and the principal Senators on the Se-
nate's Part, who, after long and continued debating the Affair for four whole
Months, at length agreed, that the Power of prohibiting Books in the Vene-
tian Territories, should belong to the'Senate‚ and not to the Inquifitors. Of
this Agreement only sixty Copies were printed at the earnest Request of the Ro-
mans, for this Reason, that it should become known but to a few. Whereas on
the other hand, innumerable Indexes of prohibited Books, in which the Power
of prohibiting them is ascribed only to the Ecclefiasticks, are every where to
be found ·, by which Artifice they defign, that this Agreement shall be
known only to a few, and may ⁴be gradually wholly lost. For which Rea-
son Father Paul thinks, that the Senate ought particularly to guard against
these Arts.

And indeed the Romanists have given Proofs enough, that they claim to
themselves only the Prohibition and Approbation of Books, and would entire-
ly deprive the Secular Powers of it, that they may not have the Power of
prohibiting Books, which they see dangerous to their Government, and de·
signed to excite Sedition and Rebellion. We have a famous Instance of this
in Cardinal Baronius, and on the other hand, we have as noble an Instance of the
just Vindication of the regal Majesty in the King of Spain, though himself sub-

A. 1097, je& to the Yoak and Bondage of the Inquisition. Baronius, in the Beginning
9. 1 ἢθη. of the Year 1605. published his Eleventh Volume of Ecclefiastical Annals‚ in

which he inserted a long Discourse of the Monarchy of Sicily, in which were
many Things contrary to the Honour of many of the Kings of Arag0n‚ and
particularly against King Ferdinand, and the other Ancestors of the King of Si-
cily, who then reigned, who also was King of Spain. This Book, as soon as it was
brought to Naples and Milan, was prohibited by the King's Ministers, as ma-
nifestly injurjous to their Sovereign. As soon as the Report of this Prohibition
came to Rome, Baronius called together a Counsel of Cardinals‚ upon the Va-
cancy of the See by the Death of Clemens VIII. and bitterly inveighed against
