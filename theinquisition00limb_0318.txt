gramine Pardon and Mercy to the Penitent, and of punishing and cormOEng
the Obliinate. This Statute was inserted into the Acts of Parliament, with
this Condition added, That the said lnquifitors, in all privileged Cases, should
share ft‘he Process with the Royal Judges. [Father Paul, in his History of
the Council of wenc, B. 5. p. 484, and 487. mentions Anthony Demohares, In-
quifitor of the Faith·‚ and p. 494. speaks of other Inquifitors in Franco.
And Thamnus, in his History, B. 8. p. 377. says, that in the Year 1551.
19th Cal. Febr. there was a royal Law rehearsed in the Senam, concerning
the Power and Office of zWatthew Orry, Inquifitor of heretical Pravity]
How long the Inquifition continued in Franco, and how and when it ended,
Ι can’t exactly affirm. Ι am apt to think, that when Liberty of Religion was

granted by the Royal Edicts to Diffenters frorn the Church os Rome, that
Tribunal immediately ceased of it self. ’

C H A P. XXIX.

Six CARmNALs appointed at Rome IN QUISITORS Gener-als.

N Italy the Pope took all poffible Measures‚ that the Inquifition should dis-
Ι charge its Office with the greatest Rigour. For when, in the Year 1530..
the Vicar General of the Order of preaching Friars, fignified to Clement VII.
that the Lnthemn Heresy prevailed in Italy, to the great Detriment of the
Catholici< F aith, this Pope publiffied a Ball, beginning, Cum ficut ex relatione.
And least this Heresy should spread like that ofArius‚ he commanded the In·
quisitors to proceed against all, even the Regulars of every Order3 but that
they should absolve the Penitent‚ dispense with them upon account of their
Irregularity·‚ and grant Indulgences to the Cross-Bearers appointed for the
Service of the holy inquisition. He commands the Bishops, that in this Affair
they should favour the Inquifition, any Thing to the contrary notwithstanding.

And that the Inquifition might proceed without any Impediment, he ap-

, 2, pointed a new Council of Cardinals Inquifitors Generals. Before this the In-
1. 21. ‚ quifitors were often forced to go to Rome to consult the Pope upon more dif-
1 · ficult Affairs ; and therefore least the Office of the Inquifition should be inter·

rupted by the Absence of the Inquifitors‚ Urban IV. in the Year 1263. crea-
ted by a Rescript, beginning, Cupientes, John caetanus Urfinus, Cardinal of
St. Nicholas in carcere Tzdliano, General and Protector of all the Inquisitors, that
there might be no need of their going to the Pope in Matters of Difficulty,
but that they might consult the Cardinal by Letters, who was himselfto con-
sult with the Pope in all Cases of Importance. Among other Things he. thus
commands: Whatever great and dangerous Impediments have arisen in the before
mentioned Affair‚ let them bestgnified to our beloved Son, John, Cardinal Deacon
