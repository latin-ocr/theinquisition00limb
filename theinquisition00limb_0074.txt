,48 TheINTRoDUCTION.

Augyst- returns him Thanks, that he had destroy'd these HeresieS, and exhorts him

l-pm. 75- firrher, that he would reform the See of Alexandria, and not only depose the
heretical Clergy of Constantinople from their clerical Orders, but expel them
from the City it self.

Evag. ὀὶ· Proterius was substituted by this Council Bishop of Alexandria, in >the room

c. 5- of Dioscoi‘2153 and, upon his taking Poffeffion of his Bishoprick, the whole
City was put into the utmost Confufion, being divided, some. for Dioscorus, ἢ

Niceph. some for Proterius. The Mob assaulted with greatViolence their Magistrates‚

¹·¹5·‘³· 8· and being opposed by the Soidiers, they put thern to flight by a Shower of
Stones ·‚ and as they betook themselves to one of the Churches {or Sanctuary,
the Mob besieged it, and burnt it to the Ground, with the Soldiers in it.
The Emperor sent two thousand other Soldiers to quel this Disturba-nce, who
encreased the Miseries of the poor Citizens‚ by offering the highest Indigni-

Evag. ].2. ties to their Wives and Daughters. And though they were for some Time ¹

‘³3' kept in Awe, yet, upon Marcian’s Deam, they broke out into greater
Fury, ordained Timotheus Biffiop of the City, and murthered Proterius, by
running him through with aSword. After this, they hung him by a Rope,
in a publick Place, by way ofssDerifion, and then, after they had ignominioussy
drawn him round the whole City, they burnt him to Ashes‚ and even fed on
his very Bowels in the Fury ostheir Revenge. The Orthodox charged these
Outrages upon the Eutychians ·, but Zacharias, the Historiam, mentioned by
Evagriics, says, Proterius himself was the Cause of them, and that he raised
the greatest Disturbances in the City : And, indeed, the Clergy of Alexandria,
in their Letter to Le0‚ the Emperor, concerning this Affair, ackno'wledge,
that Proterius had deposed Timotheus, with four or five Bishops, and several
Monks, for Heresy, and obtained of the Emperor ⁴their aCtual Banishment.

c. 5- Great Disturbances happened also in Palestine on the same Account·‚ the Monks
who opposed-the Council forcing Juvenal, Bilhop of Jerusalem, to quit his
See, and getting one ‘l‘heodofiur ordained in his room. But the Emperor soon
restored Juvenal, after whose Arrival the Tumults and Miseries of the City
greatly encreased‚ the different Parties acting by one another just as their
Fury and Revenge inspired them.

c. 9, 10. Leo succeeded Marcian, and sent circular Letters to the several Bishops‚
to make Enquiries concerning the Affairs of Alexandria, and the Council of
Chalcedon. Most of the Bishops adhered to the Decrees of those Fathers, and
agreed to depose Timotheus, who was sent to bear Diostorus Company in Ba-
nishment.

Under ZenO, the Son-in—Law, and ‘Successor of Leo, Hunnerick the Vandal
grievoussy persecuted the Orthodox in Africa. In the Beginning of his Reign,
he made a very equitable Proposal, that he would allow them t'ne Liberty of
,choosing a Bishop, and worssiipping according to their own Way, provided
the Emperor would grant the Arians the same Liberty in Constantinople,
and other Places. This the Orthodox would not agree to, choofing rather
to have their own Brethren persecuted, than ro allow Toleration to such as

differed from thern. Hunnerick was greatly enraged by this Refusal, and ωςῗιτᾶ
