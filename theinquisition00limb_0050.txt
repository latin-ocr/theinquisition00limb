he apprehendet} tha: the absolute Co-eternity ofthe Son with the Father was in-
consistent with the Son’s being begotten of him, he says that Alexander held
he was mtbegottens'v begesten, or begotten and not begotten, thus making his own
consequences pass sor the Bishop's Sentiments. On the other hand, Arius as-
serted, ‘The Son bath a beginning, and is from none of the Things that do exist ; not
meaning that he was not from Everlasting, before ever the Creation had a Βε-
ing, or that he was created like other Beings absolutely out of nothing, or that
like the rest of the Creation he was mutable in his Nature. Arius expressy de·-
clares the contrary in his Letter to Eusebius, his intimate Friend, from whom
he had no reason to conceal his most secret Sentiments, and says, ‘³ This is what
we bave and do profess, ‘snat the Son is not unbegotten‚ nor in any manner a part of
the unbegotten God, nor from any partos the material World, but that by the Wzll and
Council of the Father he existed before all Times and Ages, perfeei God, the only bego!-
ten and anchangeable, and that therefore before be was begotten or formed he was not,
i. e. as he explains himself, f There never ‘was a ‘1‘ ime when be was unbegotten.
His affirming therefore that the Son had a Beginning, was only saying, that he
was in the whole of his Existence from the Father‚ as the Origin and Fountain
os his Being and Deity, and not any Denial of his being from before all Times
and Ages3 and his sayinglthat he was no part of God, nor derived from
Things that do exist, was not denying his Generation from God before all
Ages, or his being compleatly God himself, or his being produced after a more
excellent Manner than the Creatures‚ but that as he was always from God, so
he was different both from him, and all other Beings, and a Sort os middle
Nature between God and his Creatures 3 whose beginning, as Eusebius ofNi-
comedia writes to Paulinus Bishop of Tyre, was Ξ not only inexplicable by Words,
but unconceivable by the Underslanding of Men, and by all other Beings superior to
Men, and who was formed after the most perfeb'z' Likeneſs to the Nature and Power of
God. This is the strongest Ev1dence that neither Arius nor his first Friends put
the Son upon a Level with the Creatures, but that they were in many respeQS
of the same Sentiments with those who condemned them. Thus Alexander de-
clares the Son to be ¹² before all Ages. Arius expressy says the same, that he was
ἱ before all fimes and Ages. Alexander says, the Father only is unbegotten. Arius,
flhat there never was a Time when the Son was not begotten. Alexander, that the
Subſsstence of the Son is inexplicable even by Angels. Eusebius, that bis beginning is
inconceivable and inexplicable by Men and Angels. Alexander, that tbe Fatber
was always a Fatber because of the Son. Arius, that the Son was not before he
was begotten, i.⁷ e. Thai be was from before all Ages the begotten Son of God.
