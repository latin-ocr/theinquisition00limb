198 The H1s'r01w of the INQUISITION.

Dominionsos the King. The first Instruffion of Seville, An. 1484. c. 21. hath
ordained Punishments against such temporal Lords‚ as do not obey the Ins
quifitors. Because the most serene Kings have commanded, and Reason requires it,
that Inquisition should be equally made for the Crime of Heresy, as well in the Lands
of Nobles, as in their own; therefore the Inquzfitors who now are, or hereaf-
ter shall be, must ordain in their Diocefts, that they may freely proceed to make In-
quifition in the said Countries. But ff the Nohles shall not ohey the Commands of the
Inquisttors, they must proceed against them for Rebellion and Contumacy, and inflia)
on them all the Censures and Punishments appointed by the Low, But when criminals
are sent from one Place to another, it must be at their own Expence if they
have Effeets, according to the Decree of the Madrid Instru&ion, An. 1561.
c. 9. The same is also observed in Portugal.

2 35· Ifthe Inquifitor cannot find out the Place to which the Crimina] is fled, he
cites him personally in the Cathedral Church of that Diocese to whom he be-
longs, and in the Parish Church of that City, where he dwelt before his E·-
scape, and finally in his own proper House in which he commonly lived, per-
sonally to appear within a certain Term before the Inquifitor, to answer con-
cerning the Faith and Articles of Faith, under this Penalty, that if he doth
not appear within the Term affigned him, he Ihall be excommunicated with
the greater Excomrnunication.

Thus the Council of Biterre prescribes, cap. 14. As to those who are absent
thro' Contumacy, cause them to besolemnly cited in their Parish or Cathedral Church,
and in the Places where they dwell, or have been used to dwell. And having thus
put forth legal Editts against them, and after having waited a proper Time, and ha·

ving carefully considered and discuffi’d the Ans, and having receiv’d the Advice of ⁷

such Prelates, in such Matters, as you have thought fit to consult them about, under
their Seal, proceed to their Condemnation, according to the Exigency of the Crimes‚
the Presence ofGod and his Gospels supplying their Absence. And zf any of them are
afterwards willing to return and obey, receive from them, and in general from all
such who have been guilty of Contumacy and Difhbedience, or of whose Escape you
have Reafim to be apprehenfive, good S ecurity and Bail, or cause them to be confined,
if you think it more expedient.

But in the first Council of the Prelates, probably at Tholouste, ’tis thus de-
creed of such absent Persons. But if there are any Persons criminal‚ or ficspebted,
belonging to your Inquifition, who are not present, or have not been so, and who do not
take Care to appear or excuse themselves, within a competent T erm peremptorily by
you affigned them, and published in the Churches, proceed, without Doubt, against
them, as against Impenitents. And 'tis our Sense, that all such Persons belong to your
Inquisttion, who either have offended within the Bounds of the said Inquzfition, or
have a Dwelling there, or had when the Inquisition was first made ·, or who have
restded there upon account of any Office publick or private 3 or who having no fixed
Abode, shall be found there when cited by you, whether they have any Security or not,
if you have began to make Inquisttion against them, or have enjoined them their Pur·
gation. For against such Impenients, or Absenters, you may and ought to proceed ;
excepting only, if other Inquisttors have begua to proceed against them, upon ac-

count
