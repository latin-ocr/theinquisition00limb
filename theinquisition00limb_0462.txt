other Sins, such as Covetousness‚ Intemperance, Lust, &a to which Men are
naturally prone. Others to which Nature doth not lead Men, yea rather to
which the Appetite and Pleasure of Men is repugnant3 such as, in the Titne
of a Fast not to eat till Night, or pray, or not to eat Swines Flesh, not to
drink Wine, or to observe the evil Ceremonies ofthe Mzhometans or Jews. Ar
to the former, Men are carried into them by their own Wills. As to the lat-
ter, the Will is undoubtedly governed in its Choice by the Understanding,
and therefore it may be concluded that they proceed from an evil In tention and
Belief. So that ifseveral Witneffts depose in general, that such a one hath a
good Reputation‚ their Testimony deserves no Credit to prove such a one to
be a Catholick‚ ifhe be convicted by two Witneffes‚ to have particularly said
or done something repugnant to the Catholick Faith. This is the Case when
the Aetion is forbidden. But if it be of an indifferent Nature, which may be
either good or evil, they say there ought to be no Presumption of a Crime‚
but that the ambiguous Deeds or Words ought to be interpreted on the more
charitable Side. If, for Instanoe, any one says, The Lutherans are more no-
ble, i. e. in the Catholick Sense, the Peers and Nobles in France are Luthe-
rans more than the common People, 'tis not heretical. If it be understood
of the Nobility of their Virtues and Morals, 'tis suspicious; if of the Nobili-

. ty of Religion, 'tis heretical. But this they say must only be understood as to the

full Proofof an Offence, and not asto any Presumption for which a Person may
be tortured, especially if he be suspected. For in a doubtful Case Heresy is to be
presum'd, and istheProofs appear too plain, he is to be put to the Torture (be.-
cause the Salvation ofhis Soul is concerned) that he may confess under Torture,
and be reconciled, and receive his Penance, that ifhe be capable of Correffition

- his Spirit may be saved, according to St. Paul, Farther, 'tis usual in this Office

of the Inquifition, that in expounding the Words of any Proposfflon, the Na-
ture and Condition of the Speakers be attended to ; particularly whether the
VVords were spoken by a Countryman, of poor Capacity, in a blundring Way,
and without Deceit and evil Belief3 or by a learned Person, of an acute
Understanding, and in a subtle NIanner ; for then they are to be understood
to be deceitful. All these Things are to be considered by the Qalificator Di-
vines, whom theInquifitors call and consult, and to whose Opinions the In·
quifitors ought wholly to assent. Finally, they affirm, that if the Mind and
intention is not to be proved by the external Affions, it can never be proved,
and so the Crime of Heresy can never be punished. From hence Royas con-
cludeS, that he who confeffes an heretical Aetion or Word, but denies the
wicked Intention‚ denies that which is the principa] Form and Substanoe, and
is therefore to be delivered over as adiminute, impenitent and negative Here-
tick. The same is to be affirmed of him, who being fully convict ofseveral
Errors, confeffes some, but denies others ·‚ because heis deficient in a substan-
tial Part. 'Tis not so with one who confeffes all his Errors, tho' not the se-
veral Times which are proved by legal Witneffes.

From this long Account, ofwhich this is only the summary, one may infer,
that ’tis the common Opinion of the Spamfh Doti-ors, that such who confess
an heretical Word or Action, but deny the Intention, are to be put to the T0r7

ture
