attended only by a small Retinue 3 and proper Security should be given, [hag
no Ι njury and Disturbance should be offered to him or his.

After the Imperial Power was thus insulted, no one will wonder that thelike
Process should be carried on against Ezeline, Lord of Pasiam, and zealoussy at-
tach’d to the Emperor’s Party. For in the Year 1248. the same Pope [nno-tf. 1248.
cent, as we learn from his Letters to the Prelates of the Milaneze‚ the Mar-⁹· ²5> ²⁶·
quisate of ‘1' reviso and Emilia ἦ, pronounced the Ecclefiastical Censures against
him on the Day of the Festival of the holy Sacrament, He had appointed
Inquifitors of the F aith against him before, because he had been aspersed with
the Report of Heresy. In order to refute the Charge, he sent Meffengers to
Rome, who bound themselves by a solemn Oath‚ in the Name of Caesczr‚ to
declare that his Sentiments were right concerning the Catholick Faith. But
as that Purgation was not allowed of by the Bissiop of Sabine, who was ap-

, pointed to take the Report of the Meffengers, nor by the Pope himself ·‚ be-

cause, as he pretended, the Importance of the Affair required the guilty
Person to be present ς he fixed him the Calends of August for the Day in which
he was to clear himself ς and according to the Papal Manner provided for his
Security·, hereby demonstrating, that he must entertain no Hopes of Re⁴³
conciliation, unless he would in all Things subje& himself to the Beck and
Pleasure of the Pope, and own him as supreme Judge in all Causes whato
soever.

But as Ezeline did not appear, the Pope, in the Year 1251. deputed the Raynalth
Bishop of Treviso, and the Prior of the Predicants at Mantua, t70 let him known· 1251·
that he should be subje& to all the Punishments ordain’d against Hereticks,§' 3⁶² 37=·

and that an Army of Cross-Bearers should be sent against him and his Fol-
lowers. This Process lasted some Time before the Pope pronounced the long ..
intended Sentence. At length, in the Year 1254. on the Day of the F estival ‘¹- ¹254·
of the Sacrament, Ezeline was condemn’d for Heresy, and subjected by the ς’ 35> 363
Pope's Sentence, to all the Punishments of Hereticks. Innocent publish’d a,
rnost bitter Sentence against him, in which he charged him with the most hor-
rid Crimes. He commanded also all the Prelates‚ that they should publish
the Condemnation of Ezeline, for Heresy·, and punish all who adhered to him,
with the Punishments ordain'd against the Followers of Hereticks. There are
extant-also the Pope’s Letters upon the same Subje&, to Alberic his Brother 5
by wh1ch he gave him all his Brother’s Effecflcs, whom he had condemned to
the Punishments of HeretickS, and confirmed the Sentence of William‚ Κίος,
of the Romans, by which he condemned him for Rebellion, and deprived him
of all his Landsvthat were subje& to the Empire‚
