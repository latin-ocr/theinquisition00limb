tholick Religion is equally extinguished there by the Violence of persecutions,
as those Doctrines are in Spain, which are contrary to the Church of Rome,
and which they render 0d10us by the infamous Name of Heresy. And yet
they will not allow that any just Argument can be drawn from hence to prove,
that that Persecution was given by divine Providence, as a most effectual Re-
medy for the Exstirpation of their Religion. If other Parties of Christians
would use the same Diligence and Cruelty of Inquifition against them, Ι may
venture to affirm, that they themselves could not withstand it, but that within
a few Years the Popish Religion would be extinguished in all Protestant
Countries, and scarce a fingle Person left who would dare to profess it. But
God forbid, that the Christian Re1÷gion should ever be propagated this way,
which doth not confist in a seigned and hypocritical Profeffion‚ but in a sincere
and undiffembled Faith. And therefore as no one ought to assume to himself
the Power of Judging concerning it, but God the Searcher of Hearts, to him
only let us leave it to pass the true Judgrnent concerning every Man’s Belief,
Let us in the mean while detest the Ty ranny of the Papists, and {trive to re-
duce those who, in our Judgment, hold Errors, into the way of Truth‚ by the
good Offices of Charity and Benevolence, without arrogating to our selves a
Judgment over the Consciences of others. And out of a serious Regard to the
last great Day of Judgment, let us approve our Consciences to God, and every
one of us expefting from his Mercy an equitable and righteous Judgment‚
pray without ceafing, Amsn, O LORD, AND JUDGE THY CAusf..
