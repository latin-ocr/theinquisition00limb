Friends to his Family‚ he took Care that the Council should confist of such
Persons as were well affected to them. In order to this his Excellency chan.
ged the Governrnent of rnost of the Towns of Holland, deposed those Magi-
strates who were ofthe Remonstrant Persuafion, or that favoured them in the
Bufiness ofthe Tolerati0n‚ and filled up their Places with Contraremonstrants,
or such as promoted their Interests, making use of the Troops of the States to
obviate all Opposition. The Consequence ofthis was the Imprisonment of se·
veral great Men of the Remonstrant Persuafion, such as the Advocate Olden-
hammam, Grotius and otlzers; and the Suspenfion, or total Deprivation osa
considerable Number os the Remonstrant Clergy, such as Vitenbogart of the
Hszgzte, Grovinckhovius of Remmiam, Grevius and others, by particular Synods
met together for that· purpose, and to prepare Things‚ and appoint Persons
for the ensuing national one at Dort. The Persons fixed on were generally the
most violent of the Contraremonstrant Party‚ and who had publickly declared,
that they would not enter inm Conimunion with those who differ'd from thern,
nor agree to any Terms ofsv1oderat30n and Peace. There were also several
foreign Divines summoned to this Council‚ who were most of them in the Cal-
vimstick Scheme, and professed Enemies to the Arminians. The Lay Commis-
sioncrs also, who were chosen by the States‚ were most of thern very partial
ContrarernonstrantS, and two or three of thern, who seemed more impartial
than the others, were hardly suffered to speak ; and ifthey did, were presently
suspet‘ted, and represented by Letters sent to the Senes, and Prince Maurice
at the Hague, as Persons that favoured the Remonstrants‚ which was then con-
sides'd as a Crime against the Governrnent‚ insomuch that by these Insinua-

- vinus, they were in danger of being stripped of all their Employments. The
=first Srffion and Opening of this venerable Affernbly‚ was Nov. 13, 1618.

John hogerum was cholen Prefident of it; the same worthy and moderate Di-
vine, who had befwe mannam into Low Dutch Beza's Treatise, to prove the
Lawfulness of punishirzg Hereticks, with a Presace Recommendatory to the
civil Mag1strate3 choses, not by the whole Synod, but by the Low Coun-
try Divines only , the Foregners not being allowed any Share in the
Election.

At the fifth Seffion the Remonstrants petitioned the Synod, That a compe-
tent Num'oer os their friends might have leave to appear before them, and
that the Citation m ghr he sent to the whole Body‚ and not to any fingle Per-
son, to the End that they might be at liberty to send such as they should·
judge best qualified to defend their Cause; and particularly infisted‚ that Gro-
vinckhovius and Goulart might be of the Number. One would have thought
that so equitable a Request should have been readily granted. But they were
told, that it could not be allowed that the Remonstrants should pass for a di·
stin& Body‚ or make any Deputation of Persons in their cornmon Narne to
treat of their Ari-{um and agreeably to this Declaration the Summons that
were given out, were not sent to the Remonstrants as a Body or Part os the
Synod, but to such particular Persons as the Synod thought fit to chose out of

them3 which was little less than citing thern as Criminals before a Bogy of
