tem, and 792st impudentl)¹ and damnably presumed to usttrp and assribe to thv fhlfrafhly
and fallaciousty the Title of the Pontifical Dignity, and to confer on great YVanbers of
PersOm the greater and leffl’r Orders, to perform Chrilins -Γ, to consecrate Churches
Chapels ancl Altars, to reconcile Petfims, and confirm them, by anointing them on th}
Forehead, and to exercise other Offices incumbent on the Ministry of {oe Pontifieal
Dignity‚ under a false and feigned Episcopal T itte, in the Dioceses cf 'Treves‚ May-
ence, Strasburgh and Utrecht‚ and in other Places, for the Space cf ten Tears and
more, although thou wast not a Bishop, and in Fan art not, to the great Danger of
thy own Soul, and the Souls of many others, and to the Injury and Contempt of the
whole Catholick and Universal Church; even although we Florentius Bzfhop of
Utrecht, out of the Motion of our Clemency, have thought fit to indulge thee for a
long while with Space for Repentance, whilst thou hast been kept in Custody in our
Jayl‚ that thou mightest study to appease the Anger of the most High, whom thou has}
grie-voussy offended with thy horrible Impieties‚ and with devout and frequent Prayerf
and T ears mightcst endeavour to obtain his Mercy. But thou being ignorant to return
to a found Mind, and to bring forth those Fruits meet for Repentance, which we
have long expaveat, with an hardened Heart, and obstinate Mina, hast not been
afraid, wespeak it with Grief, to despise the Spacemercifully granted by us to thee
for thy Repentance, even to this present Time, to the Loss of thy own Salvation.
Therefore we Florentius, and the other Bishops above named, being specially and

which we have seen, heard and known, and do know and understand, do perpetuallv
degrade, depose and deprive thee, being legally cited to the said Aa, from alt Eccle'-
fiasticalOrders, and the Priestly Office‚ as a Falstfier of Apostoliclt Letters, an A-
buser of the Ecclestastical Sacraments, an Enemy of Souls, a Destroyer of the Raso·-
ful, and a Transgreffor ofthesacrea⁷ Canons, and we sententially condemn thee thus
ablually to be degraded, and at length degraded, to be left to the secular Court, and
then to he punished without danger of Death.

“ After the aforesaid Sentenee pronounced on him, being present, the de-
“ graded Person was carried down, and cloathed with the sacerdotal Vest-
“ ments, carrying the Chalice, &css’ After this follows a long Aecotmt of
the Degradation in the said Book. But as I¹ shall professedly treat of this
Degradation in the following Book, Ι shall there together and at once give
an Account of this whole Affair, and say nothing of it here, that I may not
repeat the same Thing. '
