, The H1sronY ofthe INQUISITIONss

under the Pretence Of spiritual Food‚ they minister the Delights ‘’she'' ’9ίίίαῖ P ν avity·
But their θήκῃ), ω themselves is yet more savage 3 fince, besides the Loss of their
immortal Souls, they expose their Bodies to a cruel Death3 being prodigal of their
Lives’ and scarless of Destrubiion, which by acknowledging the true Faith they
might escape, and which is horrible to expreſs, their Survz'vors are not terrified by
their Example. Against fitch Enemies to God and Man we cannot contain our
Indignat20n‚ nor refuse to punish them with the Sword of just Vengeance3 but shall
purfite them with so much the greater Vigour‚ as they appear to spread wider
the Crimes of their Superstition, to the more evident Injury of the Christian Faith‚
and of the Church of Rome, which is adj'udged to be the Head of all other
Charche53 infhmuch that they have propagated their Falsehood from the Bor-
der5 ⁰f Italy, and the Parts of Lombardy, where we are certainly informed
their Wickedness fdoth more especially abound, even to our Kingdom of Sicily.
This being most highly offenstve to us, we ordain in the first Place, that the
crime ⁰f Herff, and of every condemned Sed, whatever be the Name of it,
shall be reckoned amongft' the publick Crimes, as the ancient Laws declare.
Tea, let such know that they shall be deemed guilty of High ‘T reason it self
For as the Crime of Rebellion reaches to the Loss of the Life and Goods of the
Persons condemned, and after they are dead, makes their Memory infamous 3 let
the fizme be observed as to the aforesaid Crime‚ of which the Patarenes are guilty,
And that the chedneſs of those who walk in Darkneſs, because they are not Fol-

lowers of God, *may be discover'd, we Will, that if there be none to acccuse them, ’

stria Enquiry be made by our Officials after fitch who commit thcsse Crimes, as
well as after other Malefattors 3 and that all who are informed against, if there
be but the least Suspicion‚ be examined by the Ecclesiasticks and Prelates: And if
they shall find them to err in any one Point from the Catholick Faith‚ we, by this
our present Editt, condemn the Patarenes, and all other Hereticks‚ of every Kind
and Name, to suffer Death, committing them to the Punishment of the Flame5‚
that they may be burn'd alive in publick View 3 if after being pastorally admonished
to forsake the dark Snares of the Devil, they will not acknowledge the God of Light.
Nor are we displeased that herein we gratify them, fince we are affitred they can
reap no other Fruit of their Error but Punisbment only. For stede, let no one dare
to interceed with us 3 if any shall presume to do it, let him know he shall justly in·
cur our Indignation. Dated at Padua, Feb. 22.

The third Law is this:

We condemn the Receivers, Accomplices, and Abettors of the Patarenes, to For-
feiture of their Goods and perpetual Banishment3 who by their Care to save others
from Punishment, have no Fear or Regard for themselves. Let not their Children.
be in any wife admitted to Honours, but always accounted infamous 3 nor let them be
allowed as Witneffis in any Cause5‚ in which infamous Persons are refuſsd. But
if the Chilclren of those who favour the Patarenes shall discover any one of them,
so that be shall be convic‘ted, let them, as the Reward of their Acknowledgment of
thed fgsilth, be entirely restored by our imperial Favour, to their fotfeited Honour
*an ate.
