The H1 STORY of the INQU1s1r10N.

“ Faith‚ or who professes an heretical Error contrary to the Faith‚ or who
“ defends an Error of his own, or one of other Hereticks‚ or· who is con-
“ victed before the Judges of the Fai'th of heretical‘ Pravity‚ or confefl‘es it
“ himself; or finally who is condemned for it by their Sentence.

“ A secret or concealed Heretick is one who errs in his Mind concerning
“ the Faith, and purposes to be obstinate in his Will, but yet hath not shewn
“ it outwardly by Word or Deed. He who is a concealed Heretick irrthis
“ Senfe‚ is generally called an Heretick purely intellestual z and the common
“ Opinion oft-he Doctors is, that such a one doth not incur the Sentence of
“ Excomrnunication, andis not subject to the Judgment of· the Church for
“ his Heresy‚ because the Church hath no Power over purely interna} Aes,
‘⁶ and‘cannot by its jurisdiction direct, prohibit or punish theut-‚andbe-
“ cause Excornmunication doth not belong to the Court of· Conscience„ but to
“· that of externa] Judgment. ’

“ John Royas however affirms, that the Canoniffs differ from this general
“ Opinion of the Divines‚ and determine that an altogether concealed Here-
“ tick is excommun-icated‚ because there is no Need of the Service of Men in
“ Ρεῃλ][ὶες,κνῇἰώ are ipso jure, contracted. For as a Man falls into Heresy
‘⁴ by a mere Act of his will, so for the same Reason, because he by his Will
“ alone believes heretical Ermrs, he actually? {alls into Excomrnunication·;
‘⁴ especially because Excommunication necessarily draws along with it imme-
“ diffie Execution, and cleaves to Heresy as a Leprosy to a Leper, and a.
α Shadow to a Man. He adds: If any one contrafts Heres-32 in his Mind and.
“ Undcrstanding‚ believing Gocl was not incarnare, or that holy Mary was not
‘¹ a Virgin‚ and deth not proceed to the external Aet, by openly declaring it
‘⁶ to hiwstlfor another, but contains his Error and aforesaid Heresy entirely
ln his Heca, but-afterwards, through the Influence of better Counsels‚ for-
i‘akcs ancl repents ofit, and then comes, as hath been often done, to the In-
‘·‘ quii'ztjorsofheretical Pravity‚ confeffing that he received and believed the
³⁶ said Errors, desiring from them Absolution and wholesome Pmance, is not.
“ such an one an Heretick, even though altogether and entirely concealed and
'³‘ mental, and by Consequence excommunicated‚ and therefore to be absol-
ved? And whereas 'tis objected⁹ that the Church doth notjudge of secret
“ Things‚ he adds, this is meant only of that Courr, which consiste of the
“' Actor, the Criminah the Judge and Witnesses ·, whereas the Crime of He-
“ resy, tho’ altogether conoealed, requires nothing external‚ because 'tis a
mental Offence, and is committed by the mere Thought of the Mind, and
‘⁵‘ therefore the Church may well-judge ol this without the Judgment of a
³‘ Court, and by a Parity of Reason· of Excommunication which cl‘eaves to
“ Heresy. Befides the Church forbids the inward Λᾶς of the Mind, and
‘³‘ declares a Person an Heretick, tho’ secret or mental, and therefore itjudges
“ ofrsecret Things, ancl therefore why notos Exssrommunication, which ad-

“ heres to Heresy-. This is a Decifion of great Mon-rent. For an excom·
