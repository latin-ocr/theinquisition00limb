The HISTORY ofthe INQmsrTmN,

from their City Friar Ro-wland the Inquifitor in the Year-1234. The Year
following the Pope committed the Office of the Inquifition to the Prior
of St. Mary ad gradus, and to Friar Radnlph, a Predicant at Viterbo‚ corn-
miffioning them to enquire out all Hereticks coming from other Cities,
and to absolve from Censures such who abjured their Heresy, and recon-
ciled themselves to the Church. Upon this Affair he gave Letters to both
of them at Peronse the second of the Ides of August, and ninth Year of -his
Pontificate. But two Years after, 13 Cal. oFJune‚ and the eleventh of his
Pontificum, at Viterho, he sent Letters to the Provincial of Lomhardy, a Pre-
dicant, by which he invested him with the Power of maang Inquifitors. The
Letters begin thus z Ille humani, &c. I think it worth while to give you them
entire, because they very distinffly represent the Office given -to the Inquisi-
ποτε After beginning with the usual Complaint of the Rise of Heresy„ he
enjoins the Inquifitors their Office in these Words: We therefore being wit-

1.> . ling to prevent the Danger of so many Souls, entrecii, admonish‚ and beseech your

lVisdom, and strictly command you hy these Apostolick VVriting5‚ as you have any
Regardfor the Divine Judgment‚ that you appoint finne of the Brethren committed
to your Care, Men learned in the Law of the Lord, and such as you know to be

fit for this Purpose, according to the Limitations of your Order, to be Preachers

General to the Clergy ancl People affembled, where they can conveniently do it; and
in order the more effettually to execute their Office, let them take into their Affistance
some discreet Perstms² and carefnlly cnquire out Hereticks, and fitch as are defamed

for Heresy. And if they find out either any really culpable, or such who are defamed,

let them proceed against them according to our Statutes, lately publilhed against Here-
ticks‚ unless upon Examination they will algsolntely ohey the Commands of the Church.
Let them also proceed against the Receiver5‚ Defenders‚ and Abettors of Hereticks,
according to the same Statutes⁴ But if any will abjure their heretical Defilement‚
and return to the Ecclefiastical Unity, let them have the Favour of Absolution ac-
cording to the Form of the Church, and he enjoined the ufical Penance. But let
them be more especially [ανῆ-ΓΖΔ, that sttch who appear to return, don’t commit Impiety
under the specious Pretence of Piety‚ and the Angel of Satan thus tranrform himself
into an Angel of Light. Therefore let them peruse the Statutes which we have
thought fit to puhlzfh concerning this Affair, that they may hewareof their Suhtlety,
according to the Discretion given them of the Lord. And that they may more freely
and cff²tiztally execute the Office committed to them in all the Premiffiw, we, con-
fiding in the NIercy of Almighty God, and the Authority of the bleſjed Apostles Peter
and Paul, remit for three Y ears the Penance enjoined them, to all who shall attend
their Preaching for twenty Days in their several Stations, and likewifh to those who
fh zll give them Affissmzce, Connfi‘l or Favour, in their Endeavours to subdue Here-
·tic':s, their Alienon, Receivers, and Dffmders, in their fortified Places and Castles.
Aeci as for those who shall happen to die in the Prosecution of this Affair‚ we
grant a plcnary Par-don of all their Sins for which they are contrite in their Hearts,
and which they confess with their ,Mouths. And that nothing may be wanting to
the said Friars in their prosecuting the foresaid Bustneſs‚ we grant them, hy the Te-
nour os thffe Prest’nts, full Power of involving‚ under the Ecclelicfiical Censure, all
