who were to make the Proceffes‚ and to execute other Things pertaining to
the Affair of the Faith. Or they might desire the Pope to create for them
two or three Persons for Notaries of their own Nomination. As to those who
had been Notaries, the Inquifitor could compel them to execute that Office,
although they were become Religious, by a Bull of Urban IV. beginning,

take a new Oath of them faithfully to execute their Office, and to preserve
