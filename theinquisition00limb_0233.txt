The H1sromr osche INQUISITIONss 65

Hereticks, and all his Subjects absolved from their Oath of Allegiance3
and Power was given to any Catholick Man, tho' withoutPrejudice to the Right
of the supreme Lord, not only to a& againl’t his Person, but to seize and de-
tain his Country·, under this Pretence chiefly, that it might be effectually
purged from Heresy by the Prudence of the one, as it had been grievoussy
wounded and defiled by the Wickedness of the other,

The Earl, frighten’d by this Sentence, and especially by Qhe terrible Ex· 95;
pedi-tion of the Cross-bearers against him, promised Obedience, and fought
to be reconciled to the Church 3 but could not obtain it without delivering
up to the Legate seven Castles in his Territories for Security of Performance,
and unless the Magistrates of Avignon, Nemes, and Agde, had interceded for
him, and bound themselves by an Oath‚ that if the Earl should disobey the
Commands of the Legate , they would renounce their Allegiance to
him. It was farther added, that the County of Venaifiin should return to the §- 6.'
Obedience of the Church of Rome. The Manner of the Reconciliation of the
Earl of Tholouse‚ was, according to Bzovius, thus: The Earl was brought be-
fore the Gates of the Church of St. Agde, in the T own of that Name. There were
prestent more than twenty Archbifhops and Bilhops, who were met for this Purpose.
T he Earl swore upon the holy Bady of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Relicks of the
Saints‚ which were exposed with great Reverence before the Gales of the Church,
and held by several Prelates‚ that he would obey the Commands of the holy Roman
Church. When he had thus bound himfielfby an Oath, the Legate order'd one of the
sacred V estments to be thrown over his Neck‚ and drawing him thereby‚ brought him into
the Church, and havingscourged him with a Woip, abfhlved him. Nor must it be omitted,
that when the said Earl was brought into the Church, and received his Absolution as he
was scourging, he was fi> grievously torn by the Stripc’s, that he could not go out by the
same Place thro’ which he entered, but was forced to paſs quite naked as he was thro’ the
lower Gate of the Church. He was also served in the same manner at the Sepulchre
of St. Peter the Martyr at New Castres, whom the Earl had caused to be stain.

However, the vast Army of the Cross-bearers was not idle after the Re-
conciliation of the Earl of Tholoufi’, but every where attacked the Hereticks,
took their Cities‚ filled all Places with Slaughter and Blood‚ and burnt many
whom they had taken Captives. For in the Year 1209. Biterre was taken by Bzovius,
them, and all, without any Regard of Age, cruelly put to the Sword, and the a. 1209·
