Luke xii. fage in Luke, I am come to find FJre on the Earth ; and what will I, if it be already
49, 51· kindled? Suppose ye that I am come to give Peace on Earth? I tell you nay,

but rather Di‘vtfion. How is it explain’d by Christ himself? Why, iu the
very next Words: For from henceforth, i. e. upon the Publication of my Reli-
gion and Gospel, there ffmll he five in one House divided‚ three against two, and
two against three, διο, Can any Man need Paraphrase and Criticism to ex-
plain these Paffages ofany Thing‚ but of that Persecution which should be-
fall the Preachers and Believers of the Gospel ? Or imagine it to be a pro-
phetick Description of a Fire to be blown up by Christ to consume others,
when the whole Connefftion evidently refers it to a Fire, that the Opposers
of his Religion should blow up, to consume himself and Followers? 'Jesus
knew ’swas such a Fire as would first consume himself. I am come tosend Ere
on the Earth ‚- and what will J, 'f it he already kindled? Or, as the Words should
be transsated, How do I wifh it was already kindled? How do I wilh it to} break
out on my own Person, that I might glorify God by my Sufferings and
Death? For asit follows, I have a Baptzssn to be baptizes! with, a Baptism
with my own Blood : And how am I straiten'd till it be accompltfh'd ! After this
Account of his own Sufferings, he foretells the {arne should befall his Fol-
lowers: Supposeye that I am come to give Peuce ονε Earth? I tell you, Nay, but
rather Divzfion, i. e· as I my self must suffer to bear Witness to the Truth,
so, after my Decease, such ffiall be the unreasonable and furious Oppofition
to my Gospel‚ as shall occasion Divisions amongst the nearest Keladone, some
of whom shall hate and persecute the other for their embracing my Religion.
And of Consequence Christ did not demere, in the mrst express TZrms, as the fore-
mentioned writer asserts, That he came to do that which we must suppose he came
to hinder. He did only declare, that he came to do what he was resolved not
to hinder, i. e. to publish such a Religion as his Enemies would put him to
Death for, and as would occasion Divisions amongst the nearest Relations,
through the unreasonable Hatred and Oppofition thar some would shew to
others upon Account of it· This Matter is elsewhere clearly expreffed

'john xvi. by Christ ε These Things have I spoken to you, that ye should not he ·ffinded. They
’ ³, z, 3· fhsdl put you out of the Synagogues 3 yea, the Time cometh, that whosoever killeth you,

will think that he doth God Service. And these Things will they do unto you, because
they have not known the Father nor me, i. e. have not understood either natural
Religion, or the Religion of my Gospel.

There is therefore nothing in the Condu& or Doerines of Iesus Chri-st
to countenance or encourage persecution. His Temper was benevolent‚ his
Conduc‘l: merciful, and one governing Defign of all he said, was to promote
Meekness and Condescension, universal Charity and Love. And in :his all

nomm. his Apostles were careful Imitators of his Example: Let Low, saith St. Paul,

be without Diffimulation5 be kindly affeflioned one to another with brotherly Low,

13.in Honom prefering one another. Jj it be poffible‚ as much as in you lies, live
xiii. 10.peaceably with all Men. And the Love he recommended was such, as worketh

no ill to his Neighbour, and which therefore he declares to be the sulfilling of
the Law. And, least different Sentiments in lesser Matters should cause Di-
