Hereticks, and Hinderers of the Office of the Inquifition‚ and condemned
to other Punishments, according to the arbitrary Will of the Inquifitors.
He would unquestionably have complained that: he wanted Words to describe
such an execrable Cruelty. For if what the Arians did was beyond Descrip-
tion‚ how much less can any Words give a just Representation of the Barba-
rity of the Inquifitors‚ which is as much superior to the Cruelty of the Ari-
ans, as theirs was, according to Athanastus‚ to that of the Heathens. But
Athanasius goes on : Oh their new Heresy ! Such are its chedneffis aiod Impie-
ties, that let the Devil be ever so bad, this will appear to be the Devil all over.
Such a monstrous Evil never rose up before ; for those who had any heretical Opini-
ons, used to keep their Thoughts and Sentiments to themsx⁷ves. But now Eusebius
and Arius, like Serpents crawling out of their Dens, vomit openly the Poison of their
impious Selit 3 this taking the Liberty publicfcly to blaspheme, (md the other as publick-
ly to defend his Blaſjohemy ε But this he could not defend till he had found an Emperor
to stipport his Blasphemy. On the other hand, the Fatheis in a general Council‚ of
about 300 Bishops‚ condemn'd the Arian Heresy‚ and shew'd that 'twas contrary
to the Faith of the Church .· But the Defenders of the Sea, Jeeing themselves despis’d,
and being ableto alledge nothing agreeable to Reason‚ have invented a new Way, and
attempted to support themselves ογ the secular Power 3 in which one cannot help being
amaz’d at their Instilence and Wickedness 3 and how much it exceeds all other Herefies.
For the Madness of other Herefies conststs in perswastve W'ordsgin order to deceive the
Simple: And as for the Hminem, the Apostle tells us, they deceive Men by their Elo-
quence and Oratory‚ and subtle Speeches ; and the Jews, forgetting the Scriptures,
contend about Fables and endleſs Genealogies .· voe Manicheans alst), and Valentini-
ans, and the other Hereticks, endeavour to support their Tristes ογ adulterating and
corrupting the sacred Scriptures. But the Arians, more perverse than all the rest,
plainly declare all *the other kindred Herefies to be inferior to theim, stnce they allow
themselves in much more impious Pratum, and endeavour to rival all others, but
especially the Jews in their Wickedneſs and Villainies 3 for as they immediately brought
Paul before the Governors Tritona, whom they could not convii? oftloe Crimes οο-
jebl‘ed to him ς fh these, every Day devising fresh Tricks, use no other Arguments but
the Power of the Judges 3 and if any one but once contradicts them, he is immediately
dragged before the Governor and Captain: And farther‚ other Hercfies being over-
come by the Demonstration of the T ruth, shut their Mouths in Sileme, and have no-
thing to do hut to blush upon Convittion. But this new and execrable Heresy when over-
come with Reason‚ and put to shame ογ the Power of Truth‚ endeavours to bring
Men over to its Interest ογ Violence‚ Stripes and Jails, when Words prove inef-
fettual to perswade them ς and even ογ this shews it fielf to be an Enemy to true Piety
and the Worship of God .· For ’tis the Property of true Religion, not to force butper-
swade. Thus our Lord, far from forcing Men, left them to the Liberty of their own
WM, commonly thus speaking to all: If any one will come after me; and to his
Disciples .· And will you go away also? But what is more suitable to the Nature
cffsuch an Heresy as this, which is quite repugnant to true Religion, and in Re· ·
