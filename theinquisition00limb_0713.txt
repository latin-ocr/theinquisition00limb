was sent to London‚ an Order came from the Qeen that the Punilhrnent
should be inflieted. Finally, on the fixth of February the Bodies were dug up,
anda large Stake fixed into the Ground in a certain Part of the Marker-
place prepared for that Purpose, to which the Bodies were ried, and a large
Pile ofWood placed round them to burn them. After this the Chests were
set up on end with the dead Bodies in them ⁶¹⁵, and fastned on both Sides with
Stakes, and bound to the Post with a long Iron Chain. After the Pile was
set on Fire, they threw a great Number of the Books of the Protestants in-
to it, which they had gathered together, which were soon consumed by the
spreading FlameS. Not long after this, Brookes, Bishop of Glocesten dealt in
the same Manner at Oxford, with catharine, the Wife of Peter Martym who

Befides this, the Statue of such deceased Person is now brought forth in
publick, on which the Name of the Person, whose Memory is to be condemn-
ed, is written in large Chai-aetem, and before which all the erroneous or he-
retical Articles, and all the heretical Deeds or Works‚ which have been legally
proved against the Deceased, are recited in the same Manner in which they
were done, as tho’ the Deceased himself was living and present. This Statue is
delivered to the secular Court, which the secular Judge afterwards burns, as
he would have burnt the Deceased, if he had been living, and died ob·

We haveavery famous Instance of such a Sentence pronounced against a
dead Person, in this Age, by the Inquifition at Rome, in Mark Anthony de Do-
minis, as Bzovius relates it under the Year 1479. ᾗ. 12. and following. He
left the Church of Rome and the Arch-Bishoprick of Spalaw, and came into

their Answer was, tha: they knew not what Religion she was of, because they did not under·
stand her Language. But that notwithstanding this, the Cardinal by his Letters ordered the
Dean of frideswida» ce dig her up, which the Dean accordingly did that Evtning„ and buricd her
in a Dunghill. After this, in Quem elizabeth’s Rcign, she was, by Ordci· .· spark-er, Arch ss=shop

out of the Dunghill‚ and buried in her former Place, and her Bones mixed with those of mule]-
