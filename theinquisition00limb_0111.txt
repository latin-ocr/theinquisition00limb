indeed the same Arguments that will vindicate the Alterations made in Scot-
land by the King and the Bishops‚ will vin-dicare those made in Exgland by the
Parliament and the Presbyterians.

It would have been highly honourable to the Presbyterian Party‚ had they iri-effiyteri·
used their Power, when in Poffeffion of it, with Moderation, and avoided allam·
those Methods of Persecutions and Suspenfions they had themselves felt the
Effe& ofin former Times. But to do them Justice, they had no great Incli—
nation for moderate Mensures. As soon as they camo into· the Choreb, all
others must out who would not comply, and submit to Sequestrations and Im*
prisonments. The solemn League and Covenant was imposed and rigoroussy
exaOEked of all People, as they would escape the Brand and Penalry oi Mal-ig-
nants. Many of the Epii'copal Clergy, both in the City and Country, were
expelled their Livings, though by a Gmemfiry, not afterwards imitated by
them, Provisum was made‘ior the Szipport of their *Nives and Chi-ldrem The
Lord Mayor‚ Aldermen‚ and Cornmon-Couneil·Men of Lomlm, presente
a Remonstrance to the parliament, defiring a strict Course for suppreffing all
private and separate Congregati0n53 that all Anabaptists‚ Hereticls, &a
as not conformed to the publiek Discipline‚ may be declared and proceeded
against3 that all be requ red to obey the Government settled, or to be settled,
and that none disaffefred to the Presbyterian Government, be eniploy’d in any
Place of publick Trust. An Ordinance of Parliatnent was made, hy which
every Minister that lhould use the CornmomPrayer in Church or Family‚ was
to forfeit five Pounds sor the first Time, ten- Pounds for the second, and io
suffer a Years Imprisonment for the· third. Also every Minister, fur every
Negleet of the Direcstory‚ wasto pay sorry Shillings3 and for every Contempt
of it, by writing or preaching, to forfeit, at the Discretion of those before
whom he was convietecu any Sum not under five Pmmds, nor above fifty
Pounds. The Parliament also appointed Elderships to suspend, at their Dif-
cretion, such whom 'they shouldjudge to be scandalous, from the Sacramenc,
with a Liberty of Appeal· to the elaffical Eldership, ὅθί. They set up also ar-
-bitrary Rules about the Examination and Ordination of Ministers by «frier-s,
who were to be sound in Faith, and such as usually received the Sacrament,
And in these Things they were quicken’d by the Scots, who complained that
Reformation moveri so ssoffly, and that Seels and Errors encreascd‚ and En-
deavours were used for their Tolera-tion. Great Restraints also were put up—
on the Liber-*ty oi the Prel‘s, by several Ordinances madefor that Purpose.
And to say the tuith, when they once got Presbytery established, [hey used
the farne Methods of Suspenfions‚ Sequestrations and Fines that the prelatical
Party haddone before, though not with equal Severity 3 and were as zealous
for Uniformity in their own Covenant and Dffciphne, as the Bishops were for
hierarchy, Liturgy‚ and Ceremonies.
