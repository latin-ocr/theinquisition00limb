reticks to the secular Arm, and prefs the Civil Power to put their Sentence
in Execution. But to return from this Digresfion. Martin not content to
blame Ithacius, after Priscillian was put to Death, excommunicated him, and
with him those who were the Authors of his Murther. The Fear of this
Excommunication saved many, that had been 'thrown into Psison, from
Death. The Emperor, who favoured Ithacius and Ursatus, oftentimes preffed,
and at last commanded assartz'n that: he ssiould communicate with him ·‚ but
could not prevail, till he had promised to recal the Tribunes that had been sent:
into Spain to destroy the Churches: Nor could he be at last prevail'd with,
notwithstanding the vigorous Endeavours of the Biffiops‚ to subscribe to his
Consent to communicate with him ·, so unjust did it seem [ohim to punish Men
with Death for their Errors in Matters of Faith. Few indeed was the Number
of these Biffiops, who had the Courage to oppose this persecuting Spirit·, and
therefore, generally speaking, the poor Hereticks were made to undergo all
Sorts of the most cruel Punilhments.

UT neither did the Arians, when >they had ¹an Emperor of their own
Party‚ refrain from any Sort of Cruelty, but persecuted those, by

bound thern with cruel 'Chains3 That they sent Sarapammo into Banifhment,
and beat Potammo in so barbarous a manner on his Back, that he was left for
dead, and died soon after of his Bruises and Pain 3 That they would not suf-
fer a dead Woman to be buried ; That *they eje&ed many Bissmps from rtheir
Sees, and sent thern into Baniffiment.; and that they obtained an Edi& from
the Emperor, that the Bilhops should not only be banifhed from the Cities and
Churches, but even puniffied with Death wherever they could be found. And
he adds: ffhat so dreadfully were Men terrified by them, that some pretended to
believe their Herefie53 and others through Fear chose rather to fly into Desartg
than fall into their Hands. In another Place he says: How many Bishops
were brought before Governors and Kings, and heard this Sentence from their
Judges: E1THER Sunscmmz, on DEPART FRoM YOUR CHuchas? For
<the Emperor hath commanded you should be banished from your Churches. How
-many in every City stattered themselves up and down for sear of being accused as
