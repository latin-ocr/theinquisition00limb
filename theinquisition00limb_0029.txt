of their being wise and reasonable, and never to dispute their spiritual Decrees.
The very Claim of such a Power is the highest Insolence‚ and an Affront to
the common Sense and Reason of Mankind ·, and where-ever ’tis usurped and al=
lowed, the most abjeel: Slavery both of Soul and Body is almost the unavoid-
able Consequence. For by such a Submisfion to spiritual Power the Mind
and Conscience is arftually enssaved, and by being thus render’d pasfive to the
Priest‚ Men are naturally prepared for a servile Subjeffion to the Prince, and
for becoming Slaves to the most arbitrary and tyrannical Governrnent. And Ι
believe it hath been generally found true by Experience‚ that the same Persons
who have afferted their own Power over others in Matters of Religion and
Conscience, bave also afferted the absolute Power of the Civil Magistrate‚ and
been the avowed Patrons of those admirable Doehines os Paflive·Obedience
end Non-Refistance sor the Subjeast. Our own Nation is sufficiently witness to
the Truth of this.

Need ofDivine Revelation to asfist us in our Inquiries into the Nature ofReli·

small Share of Reason, without any supernatura} Help, will suffice, if attend-

Conscience out to keeping to any Person whatsoever, because no Man can be
answ'erabl'e for it to the great Godbut myrself3 and that therefore the claim or
Dominion, whoever makes it, either over mine or any others Conscience‚ is meer
Imposture and Cheat, that bath nothing but Impudence or Folly to support
it, and as truely vifimary and romantiek as the imaginary Power of Persons dis-
⁴order-‘d in their Senses, and which would be ef no more Significancy and Infla-
ence amongst Mankind than theirs, did not either the Views ol ambitionis Prin-
