them at once five violent Strokes, which put him to such intolerable Anguilh
that he fiiinted away. After he came to himself, they inflifted on him the
last Tortore. The Torturer tied Ropes about Orobio's Wrists‚ and then put
those Ropes about his own Back, which was covered with Ide-ather, to pre-
vent his hurting himself. Then falling backwards, and putting his Feet up
against the wall, he drew them with all his Might, till they cut thro’ Orobio’s
Flclh even to the very Bones 3 and this Torture was repeated thrice‚ the Ropes
being tied about his Arms aboutthe Distance of two Fingers Breadth from
the former Wound‚ and drawn with the same Violence. But it happen‘d‚
that as the Ropes were drawing the second time, they ssid into the first
Wound, which caused so great an Effufion of Blood, that he seemed to be
(dying. Upon this the Physician and Surgeon, who are always ready, were
:sent for out of a neighbouring Apartrnent, to ask their Advice, whether the
Torture could be continued without Danger of Death, least the Ecclesiasti-
cal Judges should be guilty of an Irregularity if the Criminal should die in his
Torments. They, who were far from being Enemies to Orobzb, answered‚ that
he had Strength enough to endurethe rest ofthe Tormre, and hereby preserved
him from having the Tortures he had already endured repeated on him, be-
cause his Sentence was, that he should suffer them all at one time, one after
another. So that if at any time they are forced to leave off thro’ Fear of
&Death, all the Tortures, even those already suffered, must be succeffively
-inflified, to satisfy the Sentence. Upon this the Torture was repeated the
third time, and thenit ended. After this he was bound up in his own Cloaths,
and carried back to his Prison‚ and was scarce healed of his Wounds in se-
venty Days. And inasrnuch as he made no Confesfion under his Torture‚ he
was condemned, not as one convicted, but suspeeted of Judaism, to wear for
two whole Years the infamous Habit called Sambenito, and after that Term to
perpetual Banishtnent from the Kingdom of Seville.
p, 19, Ernestus Eremuzzdus Frifius, in his History of the Low Country Disturban-
ces, gives us an Accouut from Gonsalvius, of another Kind of Torture.
There is a Wooden Bench, which they call the Wooden Horse, made hol-
low like a Trough, so as to contain a Man lying on his Back at full Length,
,about the Middle of which there is a round Bar laid across, upon which the
Back of the Person is placed, so that he lies upon the Bar instead of being let
into the Bottom of the Trough‚ with his Feet much higher than his Head.
As he is lying in this Posture, his Arms, Thighs and Shins are tied round
with small Cords or Strings, which being drawn with Screws at proper Di-
stances from each other, cut into the very Bones, so as to be no longer dis-
cerned *. Belides this, the Torturer throws over his Mouth and Nostrels a
thin Cloath, so that he is scarce able to breathe thro’ them, and in the mean
Consalv. whileasmall Stream of Waterlike a Thread‚ not Drop by Drop‚ falls from
4276, 7700ss high, upon the Mouth of the Person lying in this miserable Condition,
