How the Articles and W itnqffies for the C R 1 M r N A L are produced and
exammecl.
H E N the Crimina] hath received a Copy of the Evidence and Proofs pegma,

against him, if he infists on his Defence, a ce2 :ein Term is grantedl· 2-mi3·

him to exhibit the Articles by which he would prov his Innocence. This
Term is not fixed to any precise Day‚ but lest ta* :he Pleasure of the Judge‚
who can grant him more or fewer Days, aa he thinks fit. And because the
Defence of the Criminal consists of three Parts, viz. in denying the Fati, or
disabling the WitneffeS, or proving his good Life and Behaviour, his being a
good Christian or Catholick, the Articles to be proved are disposed into Me-
thod‚ according to the aforesaid Divific-n. But yet the prudent and Catho-
lick Procurator or Advocate must consider his Oath, and both insert in the
Articles the Things which he believes to be true, just as they have been sug-
gested to him by the Criminal, he is to defend, and continually admonish
him fimply to confess the Truth.

At the End of the Articles produced by the Criminal, the Names of thee. 49·[
Witneffes by which he would prove his Innocence, are put down, and the
particular Article upon which he would have each Witness examined, speci-
fied. For as it can't eafily happen that any single Witness should know all the
Matters contained in all the Ardeles, therefore to prevent the Inquifitor, or he
to whom the Inquifitor commits the Examination, the Trouble of being
forced to guess who knows the Contents of such and such an Article, or of
examining all the Witneffes upon every vArticle, 'tis particulary shewn, that
such a Witness must be examined upon such and such an Article, and so of
the rest. By some he endeavours to prove, that the Person who he imagines
hath deposed against him, is his morta} Enemy ς by others, that he hath lived
a good Life, and so on. ’

If after the Articles have been produced and admitted, the Criminal will
add one or more additional Articles to them, the Inquisltor may admit them
as well as the first, because ’tis not expressly prohibited by Law. In forming
these Articles, a skilful Advocate or Procurator must consider those Things,
which may either remove or extenuate the Crime, i. e. prove the Falssiood
of the Accusadon, or extenuate the Guilt by proper Circumstances3 as,
whether the Person was mad or drunk when 116 said it, of which more
hereafter. ⁴

After the Criminal hath once produced and named his Witneffes, the In-
quifitor may, if he sees fit, and knows there is no Fraud or Deceit‚ allow
the Criininal to name others afterwards, and admit them.
