F arther, Urban IV. hath granted another Privilegc to the Inquifitors, that
they may absolve themselves and their Affistants, and dispenso with them·
selves as to their lrregularity. <T hat you may the morefreely promote the Affair
the Faith, we grant you hy the Authority of these present, that if z't should happen that
you, and the Friars of your Order, your Affistants, should in any Cases‚ by human
⁷Frailty, incur the Sentence of Excommunicatz'on and Irregularity, or rememher that
you have incurced it ·, stnce you cannot eastly, on this Account, have Recourfie to your
Priors, because of the Office enjoin’d you, you may mutually absolve one another upon
these Accounts‚ according to the Form of the Church‚ and by our Authorz'ty may dis-
pense with your selves, in Cases in which the said Priors can do it hy Grant of the A-
postolick See. They can likewise absolve their Servants and Familiars from
Excommunication for apprehending any one upon Account of their Office, as
Innocent IV. says in a Bull, beginning, Devotionis vestrce.

But there are three Cases in which the Inquifitors cannot mutually absolve
themselves. The first is, when they have omitted to proceed against any one
they ought to have proceeded against. The second, when they have falsely
charged any one with Heresy, or said that they have hindred the holy Office,
who in Rcality have not. But because 'tis very heinous not to abt for the Extirpa—
tion of the aforesaid Pravity, when such infeHious Wickedness requires it3 'tis
alst) very heinous, and most worthy of Condemnation, malicioussy to charge innocent
Persons with such Pravity. We therefore command the aforesaid Bishop and Inquisi-
tor, and others substituted hy them to execute the said Office, in Virtue of their holy O-
bcdience‚ ana' under the Threatning of eternal Damnation‚ that they proceed so dis-
creetly and readily against Persons suspected or defamed for such Pravity, that they
do not malicioussy or fraudulently, falsely charge any one withso great a Crime, or
with hindring thern in the Execution of the Office of the Inquzsstion. But if through
I latrcd, Efzvour or Low, or with a V iew of any temporat Gain or Profit‚ the Bishop
or Superior shall omit to proceed against any one, contrary to Justice and their Con·

science, when they ought to proceed upon ficch Pravity 3 or with the same View shall

charge any one withsuch Pravity, or hindring the Office, and upon this Account shall
hy any Means presumo to trouble him, besides other Punishments to he inflitted on them
according to the Quality of the Fault, fitch Bishop or Superior shall herehy incur the Sen-
tence cf Suspensson from his Officesor three Ycars, and others the S entence of Excommu-
nication. From which Sentence of Excommunication thofh who incur it, fhallnot obtain
the Benefit of Absolution from any one but the Pope himself, except in the Article of
Death, and not then without Satisfat‘t'ion made, any Privilege whatsoever to the con·
trary notwithstanding. But the Inquifitors are not subjeft to this Penalty, if they
omit to proceed through Ignorance‚ but only when they know they ought to
have proceeded, and have then omitted to proceed through Hatred, Falyour,
