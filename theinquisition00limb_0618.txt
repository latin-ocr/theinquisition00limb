188 The H1s1-01w of the INQUISITION.

If whilst the Cause is depending there arise new Prooss against the Criminal,
or he commits a new Offence, or if there appears any Thing favourable in his
Behalf·‚ if, for Instance, the Informer or Witness, upon recollecting himself,
comes to depose any circumstance that may extenuate the Crime3 or if any
other comesto discover any Thing that may make the Criminal's Innocence
appear, they are to he received. This is especially to be observed, in case
any Diseovery can be made of a Conspiracy against the Criminal‚ or os
the Subornation of the Witness or Witneffes to give Evidence against him.

C H A P. XXII.
Of the Defence of the CRIMINALS.

cap, 57, F T E R the Parties have prepared their Prooss, Pegna says, a Copy of'
the defenfive Process must be delivered to the Criminal. But Carena·
observes, that sor the Space of twenty Years‚ during which he aCted in the
Inquifition at Cremona, he never saw a Copy of the defensive Process given to
the Criminals in that Court, and he advises all the Inquifitors‚ to ἃᾶ in
the same Manner3 because sometimes the Criminal produces in his De-
fence Witnesses ofa tender Conscience, who rather make against him, and
for this Reason Inconveniencies may arise from the Grant ofthis Process. And
this he says is the Prastice of the Spanifh Inquifition. But whatever the
Copy is which is granted him, he hath a Term fixed him for making his
Defence, within which, if he thinks fit, he gives in his Informations as tc>
Fa& and Laus, to prove his Innocence.
symm, Obstinate Hereticks are denied a Defence, but Criminals, not yet con-
cath. Inst,vi‹5ted, are allowed to make the best they can. The first and principal
⁶· 17· Defence of those who are innocent, is to deny the Crimes which are falsely
obje&ed to them. Suchaone must constantly perfist in his Denial of them,
that he may not unjustly condemn, and give false Evidence against hirn-
self. Such a one however can’t prove dreffly by Witneffes that he did
not say or do such a ”1‘hing3 but when the Place and Time ofthe Crime, said
to be committed, is affigned, he may prove that lie was not then and there
present, and that therefore he did not say or do any Thing of which he is
accul‘ed. gind when he bath proved this by several reputable Witneffes, he
is to be ab olved.

Anotherkind of Defence is, is he can refute the Witnesses, i. e. if he can
prove they archis Enemies, or suborned with Money by his Enemies, or
have conspired against him.

But ’tis not an easy Matter to set alide the Witneffes in a Cause of the
Faith‚ because, as we have said, in favour of this, infamous Persons, such
as are privy to and Accomplices in the Crime, excommunicaret} PersonS, lansd
