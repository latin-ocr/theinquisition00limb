“ legal Admonition, if it be shewnto the erroneous Person, thatsthe holy
“ Scripture, or the Determination of the Catholick Church be contrary to his-
“·Herefies. But if the Heresy be not· condemned by Name, evident Argu-
“ ments shall be esteem-Zd as a just Admonition 3 in a Word, whatever is a

Fire with their Μοιιίίας gagged, and their Tongues tied, that they may not qffend

{193² whczcffl-AEgzfmlgffiirggtgyheretick is one, who will not repent of his Error, as to
⁶‘ which every impenitent Person is also obstinate. So that if his Heresy be
“ plainly proved, and he will not confess his Error with a pure Heart‚ nor
ὅ( readily abjure his Heresy, and submit to the Penance enjoined him, he is
‘⁶ to be left to the secular Judge as obstinate and impenitent, although he pro-
‘¹· tests a thousand times over that he was and is a Catholick‚ and is resolved
ff, 27, “ to live and die in the Christian Faith. So that the Impenitent is thesarne
“ that others call Negative·, and if such a one be convieted to have said or
‘⁶ written any Heresy, it fignifies nothing, though it be proved that he wast
“ a Catholici< before, or after, and every time else, unless he will return to
‘⁶ the Church, and submit to his Penance.''
³ But Simcmcas gives a different Account‚ viz. That a Person may always re-
tra& his Confeffion before the Tribunal ofthe Inquifition, and that his last
Confession only is to stand, from whence 'tis to be concluded, whether he
be a penitent or impenitent Heretick. If he persists in his Confestim, and
submits himself to the Church, he is penitent. If he retraets his Confe‘ss'ion,
Erit. 13. heis accounted and punished as an Impenitent. His Wordsssare plain, “ In the
«ᾗ. 14- “ Process of the holy Inquifition, the guilty Person may retra& his Confes—
“ fionwhen and how he pleases 3 and although he gives no probable or suffr-
“ cient Reason‚ his Retraetation is to be admitted3 and his last Confeffion is
“ to stand, whether it be for or against him ; for by this 'tis to be determi-
“ ned, whether the Criminal be penitent or impenitent. And this is the
ἕξ Course of the Law.'’
