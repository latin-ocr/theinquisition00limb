can’t make his Innocence appear plainly to the Judge‚ when at the
same time he can’t be fully convicted by Witneffes, or the Evidence of the

'Ti however disputed amongst the DoRors, whether the Proofs are to be
given to the Criminal when the Process is carried on Ex mero officio. Some
affirm it, some deny it. These different Opinions Camillus Campegius thus re-
conciles. Some Things precede all Inquifiti0n‚ and are the Original of the 1n Zanch,
Inquifition it self, viz. such Things as excite the Judge himself fo make In-C- 9·- 9-9·-
quifition‚ or which any ways give Information of the Crime committed..
These Things are called Informations‚ which are received in Court, by
which the Judge is certified of the Defamation. And he thinks the Dostors
are to be understood of these Things when they affirm, that a Judge pro-
ceeding merely by Office, and not at the Instance of any one else, is not obliged
to give a Copy ofthe Proofs. But if the Crimina] denies that he is defamed of
such a Crime, the Judge ought to inquire concerning the Fame and Insaniy,
and upon Knowledge of this must begin to proceed to Inquifition concerning
the Offence. Not that he is obliged to ascertain the Crimina] ofthe Infamy it
self, because ’tis sufficient that the Judge knows him to be defamed. So
that if in this Case the Crimina] demands a Copy, the Judge is not obliged
to give it him. But if the Judge proceedsat the Instance of another, he is
obliged to give him a Copy of the Infamy it selfiif he demands it. The Rea-
son of the Difference is this, that when any one proceeds ex mero officio, 'tis
sufficient that the Infamy appears. to the Judge, so that there is no need of
a formal Trial, because there is no Adversary to try the Cause with 3 but
the Trial is, as it were, between the Infamy it se1f‚ which is in the Place cf
an Accuser, and the Answer of the Person under Inquifition. Add to this,
ῑὴῗῑ anInquisition may be carried on, ex mero officio, without any preceding
In am .

Heiidds farther, that a Copy of the Proofs is not to be given, when the
Criminal is found contradi&ing himself, faultering or trembling. For such
ContradiGtion, Faultring, or Trembling, when other external Proofs are
wanting, may determine the Judge to proceed to Torture upon any one ol
thern. But others say that every Variation is not ,enough to order to the
Torture, Bernard Comenfis writes to the sa nie Purpose.

‘⁶ ln the Crime of Heresy the Judge or Inquisitor proceeds merely by Vir· tum-n.
“ tue of his Office, because he doth not proceed upon the Accusation of an Inq. m
‘⁵ Accuser‚ but upon Depofitions taken by Virtue of his Office, and there· 5⁰⁶1* ζζι
“ sore'tis not neceffary that he should deliver the Criminal a Copy of the ω’ ’ ’
“ Proofs and Artieles. But Pegna teaches the contrary in his·Annotations
“ upon the &North ‘Tradere Copiam.

If the Person to be put to the Qestion is caught contradiffing himself, and
there are at the same time other Proofs sufficient for the Torture, both
these Things must be added'in his Sentence. But if both os‘them don'tcon-
cur, but only one of thern, i. e,. if he is caught in Contradiction without
other Proofs, or if there are other Proofs, but no such Inconsistency, let it

be put in his Sentence just as it appears, ’ [ia
