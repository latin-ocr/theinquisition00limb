The H1sToRY ofthe INQUISITION.

Appeal. Furthermore we will, and by our Apostolick Authority decree‚ that any
one of you may prosecute the Affair or Arnen, though begun by another, even al-
though he who begun it, should be under no canonical anpeo'iinent ·, and that from the
⁶ Date of these Prefients, you, and every one of you, shall have perpetual Power
and Jurisdit‘t'ion in all and singular the Premises, even though not begua, puseus,
and future 3 that ye may be able to proceed against the aforeffaia' with that Vigour and
Firmness in the Premzfi‘s, though not begun, present and future, as though your, and
every one of your Jurisdio‘tiom in all and fingular the Premises, had been perpetu-
ated by Citation or other lawful Manner 3 notwithstanding the Edic‘ls concerfnng the
two Days Journey, made in a general Council‚ ancl ofPope Boniface VIII. our
Predeceſjbr of bleffi’d Memory‚ by which, as well the Judges as the Conservatom, de-
puted by the aforefizid See, are prohibited from proceecling themselves, or patting
others in their Room, without the Cities and Dioceses in which they were deputed,
¹and from forcing any Persons more than one Days Journey froin the Bounds of such

Diocese 3 and any other Constitutions to the contrary notwithstanding. This Decree Es ιιιιι
was dated from Avignon, Feb. Cal. 10. 1318. Soon after four F riars Minoi-smirne.
about the Year 13 18. were condemned and burnt as Hereticks at Marſs’illes by {ml- Patr.

the Inquifitor of heretical Pravity‚ who was himself a F riar Minor, because,f
as they say, they were —resolved to adhere and keep to the Purity‚ Truth and

Poverty of the Rule of St. Francis, and because they would not consent to
make the Rule less struit, nor receive the Dispensation of the Lord Pope
John XXII. made concerning it, nor obey him nor others in this Affair.
Others of the same Order affert, that these four were unjustly condemned, and
affirm them to be glorious Martyrs‚ and that: the Pope‚ if he consented to
their Condemnation‚ was an Heretick, and forfeited his Power„ Upon this,
the three next Years‚ viz. from the Year 13 18. or thereabouts‚ they were all
condemned for Hereticks by the Judgment of the Prelates and Inquifitors of
heretical Pravity in the Province of Narbonne, Beziers, Lodun in the Diocese
of Agde, and at Lunelle, and the Diocese of Magalone‚ who believed that the
aforesaid four F riars Minors were holy Martyrs‚ and who believed and held and
thought as they did concerning Evangelical Poverty, and the Power of the
Pope, viz. that he lost it, and was become an Heretick. Many however pri-
vately gathered up the burnt Bones and Ash-es of these four Friars‚ who had
been condemned as Hereticks, and kept them for Reliques, and kiffed and
worihipped them as the Reliques of Saints ς yea‚ some marked their Names
and the Days in which they suffered in the Calendars. This Account of Eyme-
rick agrees well with what we read of the Beguins in the Sentences of the Tholoufi’
Inquifition. Amongst other ThingS, we read Fol. 155. in the Sentence of Peter
Morestus de Bello Podio‚ that he believed, that John XXII. who was then Pope,
ancl whom he calls the Boar of the Forest, had destroyed the Inclosure of the Church‚
and done more barm to the Church of God, 'than all former Hereticks had done.
In the 156th fol. 'tis ascribed to Bernard¹ de na Jacina, that he said twice or
clerice, when he was speaking about the Pope’s Power to dispense with the Rule of
St. Francis : Do you believe ¹that if the Pope bound the ‘sall of an Ass upon Earth,
the Tail of an Aſs would be bound in Heaven ?
