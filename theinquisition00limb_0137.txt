The INTRODUCTION.

Indeed‚ a stri& and constant Adherence to scripture, as the only Iudge in
Controverfies of Christian Faith, would be the most likely Methorl ro intro-
duce into the Church, a real Uniformity of Opinion as wellas Praftice.
Forifthis was the Case, many Disputes would be wholly at an End, as ha-
ving nothing to give Occafion to :hem in the sacred Writings‚· and all others
would be greatly ffiorten'd, as hereby all foreign Terms, and human Phra-
ses of speech, by which the Qoestions that have been controverted among&
Christians, have been darken'd and perplexed, would be immediately laid
allide, and the only Enquiry would be, What is the Sense of Scripture ? What:
the Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles? This is a much more short and ef-
fectual Way of determining Controverfies, than sending Men to Nice and,
Chalcedon, to Councils and Synods, to Athanasius or Arius, to Calvia or Armi-
mim'us, or any other Persons whatsoever that can be mentioned, who at best.
deliver but their own Sense of Scripture, and are not to be regarded any far-
ther than they agree with ir. It was a Departure from this, as the grear:
Standard of Fama, ancl corrupting the Simplicity of the Gospel Dofftrine by
hard unscriptural Words, that gave Occafion to the innumerable Controver-
sses, that formerly troubled the Christian Church. Human Creeds were sub-
stituted in the Room of Scripture; and according as Circumstances differ'd,
or new Opinions were broached‚ so were the Creeds corrected, amended and
enlarged, till they became so full ofSubtleties, Contradiffion s, and Nonsense‚ as
must make every thoughtful Manread many of them with Contempt. The Con-
troversy was not about Scripture'Expreffions‚ but about the &Vords of Men,
not about the Sense of Scripture, but the Decrees οἵ· Councils, and the Opini-
one of Athanasius, Leo, Cyril‚ and the venerable Fathers. And upon this foot:
'twas no *vVonder their Disputes should be endles35 fince the &Vritings of all
fanible Men must certainly be more obscure and intricate than the &Vritings of
the infallible Spirit of Trurh, who could be at no Loss about the Doffffines
he dietared, nor for proper &Vords suitably to express them. ’Τίς infinite,
'tis endless Labotn·,- to consult all that the Fathers have written3 and when
we have consultet} them, &Vhat one Controversy have they rationally declded ?
XVhat one Christian Doctrine have they clearly and solidly explain'd? How
few Texts of scripture have they critically settled the Sense and Meaning of?
How often do they differ from one another, and in how many Instances from
themselves ἓ Those who read them greatly differ in their Interpretarion
cf them3 and Men os the most contrary Sentimcnts‚ all claim them for their
own. Athxznaftzzzs and. Ariam appeal to the Famem, and support their Prin-
ciples by Quotations from them. And are these the venerable Gentle-
rnen whose &Vritings are to be set up in Oppofitirm to the Scriptum, or set ur>
as authoritative Judges cl the Sense of Scripture? Are Creeds of their dit‘ta‘o
ring to be submitted to as the only Criterion of Orthodoxy‚ 01· esteemed as
Standards to (listinguirh between Truth and Error? surray with this Follx¹² and
Superstition! The Creeds of the Fathers and Councils are but hhman
Creeds‚ that have all the Marks in them of human Frailty and Ignorance. The
Creo-{s which are to be found in the Gospel, are the infallilile Dietates of
