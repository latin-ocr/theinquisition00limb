keeping another’s Wife, contrary to his Consent and Demand, or his Sister,
or any other Women related to him, the very Attempt upon whose Chastity
is an Injury to him. Or if any one goes to Law with another concerning
his Condition, to prove him only a Freedman, not F ree-born, or about his
Estate, or greatest Part of it, or for a large Sum of Money, or for robbing
him of, or destroying a Thing of great Value, or when any one injures another
in his Person or Effects. Farther, he cannot be a Witness‚ if havino been an
Enemy a long while he is newly reconciled, or who descends from a ronortal E-
nemy3 nor one who lives with another’s EnemieS, or commests Friendship
with them. Finally, nor they who are of a Family or Faetion contrary to
another Family or Faffion. However, if the Witneffes are Persons of tried
Virtue and Probity, they would not be liable to such a bad Suspicion. This Sus-
picion also ceases, when the Enmity is procured by F raud and Deeeit, and
with this View, to prevent any one's being a Witness·, or when there hath
been a long and well—grounded Reconciliation between the Persons who were
EnemieS, as to which, 'tis left to the Pleasure of the Judge to determine. And
because the Names of the Witneffes are not discovered to the Person accused,
as shall be fully shewn hereafter, because ofthe Danger that might accrue
to them, the Inquifitors are ordered to enquire concerning the Enmity of the
Witneffes, and to search out if there are any Causes, from which it may be
probably gathered that there is mortal Enmity between the Criminal and
them, the whole ofwhich is lest to the Prudence and Pleasure ofthe Inquifitor.
But ifan Enemy be reconciled, he may be a Witness, provided the Recon-
ciliation be not new, but of long standing. Whether it be one or the other,
the Inquisitor is to determine.

§- 5⁸ before he swore, or was produced as aWitness 3 and thus heis presumed to have
said it fraudulendy, and must therefore be received; but if it doth not ap-
pear that he said it fraudulently, he must not be received, especially if it be
mortal Enmity. But ifit be not, or there be any Doubt about it, the Judge
must not deslst for the bear Affirmation of such Witness, but must enquire
into the Nature of the Enmity, because, as was said before, every sort of En-
mity doth not disable a Person to be a WitnesS. But if he declares himselfa
mortal Enemy, he must not be received. But if the Enmity is not mortal, he
must be allowed, and the Judge must determine what Creditis to be given to
him. Or he declares himselfan Enemy aster he is sworn, but before he depo·
ses, and then he is not to be credited; or after he hath sworn- and made
Deposition ; and if he declares himself an Enemy immediately after he hath
finished his Depofition, he is credited as to the general Interrogatories; but
if he declares himself an Enemy some Distance of Time after, he is not
