’Tis but a poor and mean Excuse that Calvin makes for himself in this re·
speet, when he says, As {0 the Fac? Iw'll not deny, but that 'levas at my Proftcu-Epist. ad

Instances for [νς-’5 being pist to Death. But what need of Instances? He had al-
ready accused him, got him imprison’d‚ prosecuted in a crimina! Court sor
the capital Crime of Heresy, and aestually drew up forty Articles against him
for Heresy, Bl;2-.sphemy‚ and false Doffitrine. When he was convieted of these
Crimes the [ων could not but take its Course, and his being burnt to Death
was the necessary Consequence of his Convssetion. What occafion was there
then for Calvia to press his Execution, when the Laws themselves had ad-
judged him to the Flames? But even this Excuse‚ poor as it is, is not sm-
cerely and honestly made. For Cal-vin was resolved to use all his Interest to
destroy him. In his Letter to Farrel he expressy says ὃ, Inope, at least, they will ‚
condemn him to Death, but not 2⁸0 the terrihle one of beia-g burm. And in another to
Sumere, Since the Pczpzstg in order to vindicate their own Superstitions cruelly fhed
innocent Elam, ’tis a Shame that Christian Mcspfsffraetes fhould have no Courage a!
all in the Defence of certain -T ruth. However‚ I will certify you of one Thing,
that the City ‘Treasurer is rightly determined, that he fhall not escape that End which
we wish him. And in another to the Church at Franckfort d, ‘Ihe Author (Ser- Epist. ³21
vetus) is put in Gaol by our ngistrates‚ and I hope he’llfhortly suffer the Punish- Ffflel·
ment he deserves. There was but one way poffible for him to escape, and that
was by bringing his Cause from the criminal Court, where he was prosecuted‚
before the Council of the two Hundred. And this Calvin vigoroussy opposed,
and refletsted on the Syndick himself for endeavouring it. He says, that he
pretended Illness for three Days‚ and then came into Court to save that Wretch
(Servetus) from Puniffiment‚ and was not affiamed to demand, that the Cogni-
sance of the Affair should be referred to the two Hundred. However‚ he was una-
nimoussy condemned. Now, what great Difference is there between a Prosecu-
tor’s endeavouring to prevent the only Method by which a Criminal can be
saved, and his aftually preffing for his being put to Death? Calvin affitually
did the former, and yet would fain persuade us he had no hand in the latter.

’Tis much of a Piece with this, his defiring that the Rigor of Servetus’s Death
might be mitigated ς for as the Laws against Hereticks were in force at Ge-
neva, the Tribunal that judged Servetus could not, after his Convitstion of
Heresy, absolve him from Death, nor change the manner of it, as Calvin
says, he would have had it 3 and therefore his defiring that the Rigor of it
might be abated, looks too much like the Praffise of the Inquifitors, who
