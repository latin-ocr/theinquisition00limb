the Lateran Council under Innocent 111. cap, 3. and is contained, C. Excommu-
nicamus, 1. ᾗ. Damnati, vero. but with this Difference observed, between the
Effects of heretical Laity and Clergy. So that the Goods ofsuch condemned
Persons, ²f they are Laicks, shall be confiscated 3 ifof the Clergy, they shall be appli-
ed to the Churches‚ from whom they have received their Stipends.

Hence Pope Innocent IV. 1252. and ninth Year of his Pontificate, by a
Constitution made atPerouse‚ the Ides ofMay,and beginning,Ad exstirpanda3 com-
manded the confiscated Goods of Hereticks to be divided into three Parts, and
applied in the Manner as is prescribed in these Words. Moreover, the chief
Magistrate or Ruler shall be obliged so to divide the Effet‘t's of Hereticks, which shall
beseized and found hy the said Officials, and the Fines which fhall be exactat for
them, as that one Part shall go to the common UJe of the City or Place, the second to
the Officials who shall he engaged in the Affair, in Favour and for the Affistance of
the Office ; ans] νῖν third shall be depofitea' in somesafe Place, to he reserved and ex-
pended as the said Diocesan and Inquifitors shall think fit, and with their Aci-vice, in
Favour of the Faz'th, and the Extirpation of Hereticks, notwithstanding any Statute
made, or to he made to the contrary. This Alexander IV. confirmed An. 1259.
by a Constitution‚ beginning, Ad exstirpanda. But in the Year 1260. he
granted by an Extravagant at Genoa, beginning, Distretioni vestrce, to the In-
quisitors in the Roman Province, and Administration of St. Francis, that the
Goods of Hereticks and others mentioned in it, should be sold, and tbe M‘oney
kept for the Uses of the Church of Rome. By Authority of these present, we
grant full and free Power to your Discretz‘on, of which we have fall Confidence in the
Lord, osselling and cli-vidingfreely the Goods of Heretick5‚ their Favourers, Belie-
vers, Receivers, and Defende& already publifhea', or confiscated, or hereafter tohe
published and cotfiscatecl, as you shall think the Affair of the Faith· committed to you
fhall require 3 and of reserving the Money arzfing from thence to the Use of the Church
of Rome 3 and also of compelling all whofh-all oppose you in this Matter, by Ecclesi-
astical Cenfitre, without allowing them the Benefit of Appeal.

Clement IV. his Successor, An. 1265. by a Con-stitution beginning, Ad ex-
stirpanda, ordered the same threefold Divisiom but makes more particular

Mention of the Effects. Moreover, the chief Magistrate, Offioer, Consul, or any
other Rider, shall be obliged to divide in fiteh a Mamzer all the Effeci» qsHereticka',

and their Receivers, which shall be seized or found by the said Officials, and the Fines
exattedfor them ·‚ as alst) all the Timber, Stones, and Tiling of the Houses and Ca*-
stles that fhall be destroyed on the Acconnt of Heres& ς and alst> alt the moveable and
immoveable Effct‘t‘s that shall he confifiated on the same Account, as that one
