the second·, for which they giVe this Reason‚ because he may have spoken·
with the Criminal, and so is presumed to be corrupted and suborned, and
therefore his first Depofition stands firm.

Farther, insamous Persons may be admitted as Witneffes in this Tribunal,
such as Whores and Bawds‚ when they testify ofThings done in the Bawdy·
House. Such also as are under the Ban, whom the Inquifitors may cite be-
fore their Tribunal, and grant a safe Conduct, that they may be examined as
VVitneffes in the Tribunal of the Inquifition, altho’ the secular Prince hath
put them under the Ban, because the Inquisitor is greater than any supream,
secular Judge‚ and may proceed in Causes of the Faith freely‚ and without*
any Impediment whatsoever of Law or Faet. Usurers also, Bastards, com-
mon Blasphemers, common Gamesters, Persons quite drunk, and not only ex-
hilarated by Wine, Stage-Players, and Prize Fighters, Apostates from Res·
l'igion, Persons bastinadoed, Bankrupts‚ Traitors‚ Backbiters and Spendthrifts.
But they add, that these are not Witneffes above all Exception, and that they a-
mount only to halfProof3 that they may be admitted to prove Heresy, and the
substantial Circumstances that prove it, such as Familiarity wit-h Heredeks,
secret Conventicles, and the like, but not the external Circumstances neceffary
to it, Baptism for Instance, which is pre-requifite in the Case of Heresy.
Belides the Number of Witneffes may make good their Incapaeity‚ though

they fiUx, and say that four are sufficient to condemn the Criminal to the or-
dinary Punishrnent. Others leave it to the Inquifitor to determine the
Number.

Here 'tis to be observed‚ that a Witness, whatsoever he is, saying one

nvoce Thing out os the Trial, is not allowed to say the contrary in the Trial,
³· so* that they stand to— what he first says, unless 'tis to be presumed that

he spoke fraudulently. As if a Witness of mean Fortune should say in the
Presence of some great Person sornewhat in his Favour, and afterwards
should say upon Oath the contrary, what he first says mustnot stand good,
because 2tis prefumed he said it to please the Party, but what he afterwards
says at the Tria} must be allowed, because 'tis supposed he speaks Truch
