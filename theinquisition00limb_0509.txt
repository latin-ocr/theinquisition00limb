with as many Inquifitors, were not sufficient to take the Depofitiong of [he
Witneffes, The Lords Inquifitors being thus overwhelmed with the Multi-
tude of Affair3‚ affigned another thirty Days for the Witnesse33 and when
this was not sufficient, they were forced to appoint the same Number a third
andasourth time. For as to XVomen of Reputation, and others of higher
Condition, every Time was not proper for them to apply to the Inquisi-
torS. On one hand their Conscience forced them to a Discovery through a
superstitious Fear of the Censures and Excommunication ς and on the other
hand, their Regard to their Husbands‚ whom they were afraid to offend, by
giving thern any il] Suspicion of their Chastity, kept them at home, and
therefore veiling their Faces after the Spanifh Custom, they went to the Lords
Inquifitors, when, and as privately as they could. Very few, however,
with all their Prudence and Craft, could escape the diligent Observation of
their Husbands at the Time of Discovery, and hereby poffeffed their Minds
with the deepest Jealousy. However, after so many had been informed
against before the Inquifitors‚ that holy Tribunal, contrary to all Mens Ex-
pectations, put a Stop to the Affair, and commanded all those Crimes which
were proved by legal Evidence, to be buried in eternal Oblivion.

In the mean while this Crime, according to the Bulls and Echecs ofthe Popes,
ought to be judged and punished before the Tribunal of the Inquisitors.

Itis required however, that the Solicitation be made in the A& of Sa· Ξῖ»
eramental Confeffion, or immediately before cr after it, i, e. that no A& in-
tervene between the Solicitation and Confeffion. Hence they do not count it 32·
an immediate Ast, if a Vv'oman coming to confessis prevented by her Con-
fessor, and persuaded to putoff her Confeffion to „hother Titne, and when {he
harh changed her Intentien of Confeffing, is solicited by her Confessor. Such
a one however, is comprehended in the Constitution of (ἤρξω-χ, because 'ne
solicites under the Pretence of Confeffion. Nor is an A& immediate, if a
Woman desists from her Purpose of Confeffion after the Confession is actually
begun, and says to her Confeffor, she will not confess any more, but tali:
