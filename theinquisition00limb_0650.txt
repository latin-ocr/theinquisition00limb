he receives by the sudden Stop or bis Fall, and the Weight at his F eet stretch0
ing- his whole Body more intensely and cruelly.
In the next Paragraph, Et Audivi, he gives a more distin& Explication of
this Matter, and reckons up three Degrees of Torture. ‘she first is to terrify,
which comprehends not only ‘Ihreatnings to Torture, but the being carried to the Place
of Torments, the being stripped and bound ς unless such Binding should huppen to be
toofhvere and hard, ulid perform'd with a Twist, as is the Custom of most Judges.
T hus it was prastised upon a certain Phyfician of Olezo, who suffered more by being
bound, than others in the very Torture. And therefore such Binding may be equalled
to the‘Torture it self The second Degree is, to put to the Torture, or to interrogate
by Torture. This is done by hozsting ιι Person up, and keeping him hanging for a
confiderable Time. T he third is to torture by Squaffiztion, which is performed among st
us by one Jirk of the Rope. But if the Senate commands that the Person be well or
severely thus tortured‚ they give two Jirks of the Rope. Antonius Drogus, in his An-
notations to this Place, sayS, That you may have the perseo}1 modern Pretiae, ob-
serve, that when the Senate orders, let him be interrogated by Torture, the Person is
lifted or hoisted up, but notput to the Squufflztion. If the Senate orders, let him be
terim-ed, he must then undergo the Squaffcttion once, being first interrogated as he is
hanging upon the Rope and Engine. [f it orders, let him be well tortured, ’tis un-
derstood that he must suffer two Squaffutions. If it orders, let him be severely tortured,
'tis understood of three Squaffcztions, at three different Times within an Hour. If it

ticular Manner which they intend, and· the Judge may proceed· to every Severity not
reaching to Denth. But when it says, very severely even unto Death, then the Cri-
minal’s Life is in immediate Danger.
The like Method of Torture was formerly praffised in the Inquifition atv
Tholouse, as appears from severa] Places in the Book of Sentences. Thus
fol. 67. at the End of the Sentence of Wlliam Sicred, jun. we read, Nor would
he judicially confess coneerhing the aforesaid, till he was put in Jayl, and hoisted up a
time upon the Rope. And in fol. 13 1. we read that Wlliam Cavallerii‚ after a
confiderable Time, revoked what he had before confessed, saying, that he>
confeſj‘ed nothing concerning Heresy‚ but what was forced from him by the Violence of
forment. And finally, fol. 132. in the Sentence ok F riar Ber-nard Deliciost, of the:
Order of Minors, amongst other Things, this was imputed to him as a Crime,
that he justified those who were apprehendent for Heresy, and condemned for it, and ”
ordered to perpetual Imprisonment and other Punishments, and that tho’ they were
true Catholicks‚ they had confeffi’d Heresy of themselves and others, only thro' the‘
Violence of their Torments, and were unjustly condemned.
