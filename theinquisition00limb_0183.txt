The HisToRY osthe INQUISITION.

applied themselves to the secular Powers, that hy their Sentence and Authorffy they
would homst) the Hereticks from Cities, viz. Instantius and Salvianus, Helpidiug
and Priscillianus. And when afterward Priscillianus appealed from the Synod
0f Burdeaux ¹⁵0 the ΕΠἸΡΕΓ or, the Bilhops Idacius and Ithacius followed him as
his Accusers ε But Martin, then Bishop of Treves‚ was continuallysoliciting Itha-
cius to defist from his Accusation 3 and pruyed Maximus that he would uhstain from
the Blood of those unhappy Men 3 that it was more than sufficient, that they were nd-
judged Hereticks, and expelled the Churches hy the Episcopal Sentence3 and that 55
was a new and unheard-of Impiety, that the Civil Power fhougdjudge in the Af-

fairs of the Church. And the Interceffion of Martin prevailed so far, that'

whilst he continued at Treves all Process was stopped 3 und when he was about
to go from thence, by a peculiar Influence, he obtained a Promis} from Maximus,
that nothing. cruel should be infliiled upon the Accused 3 although, after his De-
parture‚ Priscillianus was condemned to Death. The Reason affigned by Bel-
larmine, that these Bishops were censured, viz. because they brought an Ecclcfia-
stical Affair hefore the Emperor, and became Accusers in α Cause of Blood, is very
frivolouS. ’Tis true, that Martin blames Ithacius that he accused Priscillian
before the Emperor's Tribunal 3 and that, as Sulpicius Severus testifies, not
so much from his Hatred of Heresy, as from a Defire of Revenge 3 and there-
fore Martin adds, that it was a new and unheard-of Impiety, that the secu-
lar Power ssiould judge an Ecclefiastical Cause. But by this Murtin plainly
lhow5‚ that secular Punissiments ought never to be infliCted on religious ΑΕ·-
conns, because Matters of F aith do not come under the Cognizance of the se-
cular Tribunal 3 and that the Progress of Heresy neither can nor ought to be
prevented by the Blood of Hereticks 3 and therefore he obtained a Promise
from Maximus that nothing cruel should be inflifted on the Accused. We ac-
knowledgewithBellarmine, that aBishop ought not to be an Accuser in the Cause*
of Blood3 but at the same Time, cannot imagine, with what Justice a Bis
shop‚ who ought not to ac't the Part of an Accuser, may not only excommu-²
nicate Hereticks‚ but, as Bellarmine contends, deliver them over to the secular
Power, and even exhort the Judges to perform their Duty ι For this is some-2
thing more than to a& the Part of an Accuser. An Accuser only labours to
prove the Crime, that when proved, the Judge may pass Sentence on it 3 but
when a Bishop, by his own Sentence, pronounces any Person an Heretick, and Y
delivers him over to the secular Arm, he lays the Judge under a Neceffity of
burning, without any farther Examination, the miserable Heretick, And if,
thro’ Compaffion, he seems willing to defer the Execution, the Bishop exhorts‚
and even compels him, under the Penalry of Excommunication, to perform
his Office. Who in such aCase will clear the Bishop from the Guilt of the Blood
and Murder of the Heretick? Who doth not see that the Bishop is> the >sole
Cause3 and the Civil Magistrate, who in all Things blindly submits to the
Bishop, is the Instrument only of the Heretick's Death 3 especially as it is un-
]awful for him, under any Pretence, to refuse Obedience to the Bishop's Or-
ders? If therefore 'tis unlawful for a Bishop to turn Accuser in a Case of
Blood 3 much more unlawful is it for him to deliver those he condemns as ΗΞ-
