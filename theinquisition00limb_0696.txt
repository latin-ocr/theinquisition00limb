Ceremony. The Bishop himself, cloathed in his Pontificalibus, affisted by the
Erelates of his Diocese‚ places before him the Person to be degraded, cloath-
ed with all his Vestments, just as if he was going to divine Service, and de-
grades him from his Order, beginning with the highest, and so gradually de-
lcending to the lowest. And as in conferring Orders, the Bishop uses a Form
of Words appointed by the Church for this Purpose·, so also in degrafflng,
when he deposes him from the Cloak and the Gown, and other Degrees, he
uses Expreffions quite the contrary, by which he declares he deprives him
of this Order.
So that the conferring os Orders, and the Degradation from them are per-
formed in a Manner, and with Ceremonies directly contrary to each other.
For when Orders are conferred, they begin from the lowest till they gradu-
ally rise to the highest. F irst, they confer the Order of the Door-keeper,
The Bishop takes the Keys from the Altar‚ and delivering them to him
when he appoints a Door-keeper, says, Do this as one who must give cm Account
to Goa' for the ‘Things locked up by thes& Keys. The Bishop ordains the Reader
with this Ceremony. The People being present athis Ordinadon, the Bi-
thp delivers him a Book, in which are written the Things belonging to his

you faithfully (md profitably fulfill your Office, have part with thofh, who from the
Begz'nning have administred well the Word of God. The Bishop ordains an Ex·
orcist, by delivering to him a Book, in which the Exorcisms are contained‚.
using this Form of Words, Receive and commit to Memory, and have Power·
of layz'ng Hamis upon the Poffeffed‚ whether baptized, or Catechumens. In the Or-
dination os an Acolythist, this Ceremony is observed. After the Bishop di·
ligently admonishes the Persons to be ordained of their Office, he delivers to
each osthem Wax—lights, after this manner. Receive the Candlestick with the*
Wax-light, and know that you are ingaged to light the Tapers of the Church, in the
Name ofthe Lord. Then he delivers to him the empty Flaggons, in which
they serve up Water and Wine at the Sacrifioe, saying, Recez‘ve the Flaggons
to mimster Wine and Waterfor the Eucharist of the Blood of Christ, in the Name ⁰f'
the Lord. When the Bishop ordains Sub—Deacons, he admonisties them, thatt
the Law of perpetual Continence is injoined this Order, and declares that no,
one is taken into the Order os Sub-DeaconS, who is not voluntarily determi-
ned to submit to this Law. After this, when the solemn Prayer of the Li·-
tanies is said, he enumerares and explains what are the Duties and Funfflons
of the Sub-Deacons. When these Things are done, all those who are to be.
ordained, receive from the Bishop· the Chalice and sacred Patrens 3 and from
