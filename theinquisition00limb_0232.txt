the VVives of these Cross-bearers, if any of them were married, that they

would not perswade their Huibands to sorsake this War for the Support of the

Eeclefiastical Iminunity ·, and promised them eternal Life for so holy a Service.

And to distinguish thern from other Laicks, he ordered that both the Men and
their Wives ssiould wear-Garments of white and black Colours, tho’ they dif-
fered as to their Make. They also repeated in the canonical Hours the Lordffi
Prayer, and the Salutation of the Angel so many Times, as was customary in
any other common Wars. It was ordained also, that none should be admitted
to this sacred VVarfare, without a previous rigorous Examination of his Life,
Mamers and Faith‚ whether he had paid his Debts, forgiven his Enemie3‚
made his Will, that he might be more ready for the Battle, and obtained
Leave from his Wife before a Notary and proper Witnesses. The Wives of
those who were ssain in the Expedition promised they would never marry again.
This kind of Warfare was anthat Time very acceptable, so that many eagerly
entered into it, that by the Slaughter of Hereticks‚ and the Plunder of their
Goods, they might march away ιο Heaven.]

But because even these Cross-bearers did not fight against them with that con-
tinued Zeal and Fury, that thePope and Dominick w'ould have had them, the
y Dominicans excited larger Numbers tossengage in this Warfare‚ by the Hopes of

Effer, de a plen-ary Indulgence. The Text which their Preachers used to chuse for this
sac. cap. Purpose‚ was from Psal. xciv. 16. ›Wao will riſse up for me against the Evil doers ἓ
s· Μ· Or who will stand up for me against the Workers of Iniquity ἒ And as they di-

retied their whole Sermons to their own cruel Purpose, they generally thus
concluded: Yon see, most dear Brethren‚ how great the chedness of the Here-
ticks is, and how much Mischief they do in the World. Tou see alst) how tenderly‚
and by how many pious Methods the Charch labours to reclaim them. But with
them they all prove ineffeb'tual, and they fly to the Secular Power for their Defence.
Therefore our holy Mother the Chuni), tho’ with Reluaance and Grief, calls together
against them the Chrzstian Army. Jf then you have any Zeal for the Faz'th, ifyou
are touched with any Concern for the Honour of G0d‚ if you would νεαρ the Bencfit of
this great Indulgence, come and receive the Sign of the Cross, and join your selves to
the Army of the crucified Saviour. There was indeed this Difference between
those who took up the Cross against the Sarmens, and those who did it against
the Hereticks‚ that the former wore it on their Backs‚ and the latter o‘n their
Breasts. And that their Zeal might by no Means grow cool‚ there were cer·
tain Synodical Decrees made by the Authority of the Pope, by which the Pres-
Uffer. ibid. byters were enjoined continually to excite and warm it. Let the Presbyters con-
c210.§.23.tinually and affeHionately exhort their Parifhioners that they arm themselves against
the heretical Albigenses. Let them also enjoin, under the Pain of Excommunication,
those who have taken the Craſs, and not prosecuted their Vow, that they retake
the Crass and wear it.
