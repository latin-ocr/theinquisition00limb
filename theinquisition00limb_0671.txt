therefore doth not depend on the Pleasure of the Inquifitor‚ and because by
such Condemnation he hath pronounced a definitive Sentencc‚ and so censes
to be a Judge. Zanchz‘n. de haeret. cap. 21. And these Penances in general are
laid upon any Persons.

Priests and others of the Clergy are not usually injoined publick Penance‚Si mmmmm
both because of. the Dignity oftheir Order, and that the Flock os the Faith-t· 47-
ful may not be offended. But altho’ this is to be observed in smaller Crimcs, 9· 74, 7‘1
yet in more heinous ones the Priests are to be compelled to undergo publicl<⁷⁶‘
Penance‚ and the rather in the Crime of Heresy, because such Offences in
Priests are more heinous than in the Laity. And not only Clergymen and
Presbyter-S are obliged to this publick Penance‚ but also Bilhops, Cardinals
and others, howsoever dignified ς because all Men are upon an equal Foot in
Matters partaining to the Orthodox Faith. Add to this, that heretical Cler-
gymen, returning to the Church, are, after Injunction of Penance‚ to be depo-
sed, at least by a verbal Degradation, by which they are suspended from the
Exercise of their Orders: But of this hereafter.

[Carena observes particularly concerning Regulars, that when they fall intop. 3· t· 19·
Crimes relating to this Tribunal, they are usually punished with some pecu· §- 1¹·
liar Punishments. These are the Privation of active and paffive Votes, of the
Office of Preaching, and of hearing Confeffions, especially those of Women ς
that the Sentence of the Inquisitors must be read twice a Year in a Chapter
of the Religious and Presence ofthe Criminal, that they take the last Place in
the Quire and Refectory, that they must be whipped by their Religious in a.
Chapter and Presence of the Notary os the holy Office 3 and others. But Ca-
rena adds, these Punissnnents are to be injoined with great Moderation, Re·
gard being always had to the Heinousness of the Offence‚ and the Qality of
the Offender3 but yet in such a Manner, as that the Inquisitors ought to
know, that such Punishments are not imposed only on soliciting Confcffors,
but even upon the Religious who offend otherwise. Hence it happened some
Years ago in our Congregation at Cremona, by Order of the sacred Congre-

condemned, publicssly to revoke som? Propofitions that were ra}sh‚ scanda-
lous, and offenfive to pious Ears, in the same Place where he had preached
them3 and was farther deprived of his active and passive Vote, and the Os-
fice of Preaching and Lesturing, together with other wholesome Penances.
Thus also i'n a solemn A& of the F aith celebrated in the Kingdom of Sicily, Friar
Marcellus de Pratis, a Religious of the Order of the Minors, was condemned by
that most illustrious Tribunal, because he had rashly seigned himself a Saint‚
impeccable, confirmed in Grace, and had pronounced other scandalous and
vrash Propofitions, to the Gallies for three Years, to be banished for two more
into such a Convent of his own Religion as should be affigned him, with this
Addition, that he should fast every Fridav on Bread and Water, eat upon the
