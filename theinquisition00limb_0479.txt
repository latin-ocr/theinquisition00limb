lind Help : hiwing, that thofh who hithertoy have done, yangdfhall do tyhtss³ Thingss,
fhall always obtain the special Favour of the Apostolick See, and find us favourahle and
kind in all their Occastons. But as for theſs? whom we shall know to be Contemners,
befides the divine Judgment that hangs over them, they shall not escape the Ecclefi-
a ical Ven eance.

stThe Γειὲῖε Pope, in the Bull beginning, Ne commiffum vohis, says, That if
the Clergy and Religious shall not affist the Inquifitors‚ according to their
Duty and Ability‚ they ffiall be proceeded against according to the Canonical
Sanetions, notwithstanding any Privileges. And in the Decretals V. in the
Chapter Exwmmunicamns, at the End, the Bishops are commanded, under the
Penalty of Depofition, to perform all these Things.

But Innocent IV. in his Bul] to the Provincial of Lombardy, beginning,
Tunc potiffime‚ hath threatned with all imaginable Curses, and the most ter-
rible Destrufflon, Magistrates, unless they promote the Affair of the Inquisi-
tion‚ and much more if they presume by any Means to hinder it. Inafinucthovius,
as we defire above all Things to promote this wholesome Affair‚ we intend, with the a. 1252·
l Help of God, wholly to remove oll manner of Obstruttions from it, And thereforessl·4·
o if it should so happen, which however we do not believe, that any City or Communi-
¹ ty, any Princes or Nohles, or others in Power, fhallpresume to oppose this Bufineſs,
or by any Means to ohstrut‘t' it, so that those who are deputed by us for this Affair
cannot freely proeeed therein 3 yea, unless they cherish it, and studioussy affist it, we
fhallfiverely reach forth against them the Sword of the Ecclesiastical Power, to sup-
press so audaeious and pernicious Insolence, and wholly to confound it; and we will
call in against them the Kings and Princes, and other Faithfulof Christ, who have
taken on them the Sign of the Cross, whether for the Succour of the holy Laud, or
otherwise for Christ’s Serviat, as also the rest of the Catholicks, that Heaven and
Earth may be moved up together against this detestable Rafhness 3 stnce ’tis no less expe-
dient, hut rather more soto defend the Faith in Places near us, than in those which
are forther distant. The same Things are almost to a VVord extant in the Bull
of Ulban IV. beginning, Licet ex omnibus mundi partibus. Publissied An. 1262.
