and Patience of its first Profeffors‚ and not on their abustng and injuring others .-
It grew by Persecutions, and triumphed by Martyrdoms. For tho' he shews him-
self very severe against Hereticks, yet he was not for punishing them with
Death, but [reating thern with Gentleness. Thus in his Comment on Hosea ii. ι.
You that believe in Christ, whether Jews or GentileS, say ye to the Branches that
are broken off, and the People that is cast out, My People, for he is thy Brother3 and
my Sister, for she hath obtained Mercy. When the Fulness of the Gentiles shall come
in, then shall all Israel be saved. T his is commanded us, that we should not wholly
despair of Hereticks‚ but provoke them to Repentance‚ and with a brotherly Affection
wish their Salvation. And explaining the Parable of the Tares, Matt. xi-ii, he
says ε Whercfore he who governs the Church ought not to sseep, lest thro’ his Neg-
ligence the Enemy should sow the T ares, i. e. heretical Opinions. But whereas '’tis

said, lest gathering the fs ares, ye pluck up alst) the Corn, 'tis to shew us, thatthere

is a Place for Repentance‚ and that we ought not hastily to cut off our Brother, be-
cause it may happen‚ that he who ‘To-day is infetled with heretical Pravity, may re-
pent To-morrow‚ and become a Defender of the T ruth. And in his Commentar y on
the Epistle to the Galatiam, ch.v, 9. A little Leaven leavens the whole Lump‚ among
other Things he hath this: A Spark is to be extinguished as soon as it appears,
and the Leaven not to be stiffer'd to approach the Lump .· C orrupted Flifh is to-be cut
offi and scaby Sheep to be driven from the Sheepfold, lest the whole House, Lump, Body
and Flock, should beburn’d, leavened, corrupted, and perish. Arius at first was
butas a stngle Spark‚ which, because it was not immediately exhngyafhed, set on Fire
and ravaged the whole World.

St. AUGUSTINVE’S Opinion concerning the Perficution of Heni-miza

Ugustine, in his former Writings, condemned all Violence upon the Ac·-
count of Religion 3 for, writing against the fundamental Epistle of Mani-
chceus, he begins with this Address to the Manichoeans : ΕΤ he Servant ostheLord
oughtnot to strive, ὅτε. It is therefore our Bufiness willingly to affl this Part. God
gives that which is good to those who willingly ask it of him. T hey only rage against
you, who know nothing of the Labour that is neccffary to find out T ruth, or the Diffi-
culty os avoiding Errors. 'Tis they who rage against you, who know not how uncom-
mon and difficult it is to overcome carnal Imaginations by the Calmness of a pious Mind.
'Tis they who rage against you, who are ignorant how hard z't is to heal the Eye of the
inward Man, so that it can behold its Sun3 not that Sun whose celestial Body you
worship, and which irradiates the fl⁶st³ly Eyes of ,Men and Beasts, but that of which
the Prophet writes, The Sun of Righteousness is risen on me v3 and of which we
read in the Evangellsta He was that true Light which enlightens every Man >that
,eometh into, the World. T hey rage against you, who know not that ’tis by asiai?
