wzt'z' he no Remainsof Hereticks‚ none of their Books or lVritings in their Provinces.
<T heir mischievous Sermons will then he at an End, there will he no more clandestine
Conventicles, in which Hereticks are wont to introduce strange Customs, abhorrent
from Christian Piety. This is what we desire with all our Soul, ancl ask in our con-
stant Prayers from the Lord, hoping that a Stop will be put to these Thing5‚ whiltl
Christian Princes hravely suppress Hereticks‚ and we add our pious Labours to sre-
vent the W olves from destroying the Sheep committed to our Care. And thus at length
the Lord will grant us that Peace and Tranquility in this Life, which is fi) much
defired and fought after by the Faithful, and after this Life shall be at an End con-
summate Happineſs. But inasmuch as we know, that it is not sufficient to answer
these Ends, merely to exhort the Faithful, unless the Rebellious are stipprcffid hy pro-¹
per Severity, we have decreed to provide a proper Anticlote for this purpose. And
therefore hy that Authority with which we are invested‚ we hy theste IVritin-gs put und
der the Sentence of Excomrnunication, all Perstms whatsoever in our Province,
who shall presume rafhly to affert, teach or write ficch impious Tenen, as al-
so all such who by any Means fhall affist, counsel or favour them. I cannot certainly
affirm whither the Inquifition, which for many Years had been dropped in
Frame, was by Means of this Synod restoredthere. This is certain, that the
Laws used in the Tribunal of the Inquisition were ren‘ewed bythe Decree of
this S'ynod, and that there is express Mention of the Inquisitors in it 3 and by
other Things it appears that about this Time theInquifition was again brought
into France.. For Francis I. chose Inquisitors of the F aith from the Predicant
Friars.› For in the Orders of that Prince, fol. 408. there is a Writ bearing
Date May 30, 1536. by which he appoints·Matthe‘cv Orry‚ D. D. a Predican‘:
F riar, Inquifitor of the Faith. Ribadineira also relates in the Life of -Ignatius Du Gange
Loyola2Book II. Chapn. and XIV. [and John Peter Maffieius, in his Life in 5:20ch 1²²5
of- the same Loyola‚ l. 1. c. 20. p. 315.] that about this Time he was accused qfflss'ffi
before Mchael Orr3½ a Dominican Divine, and inquisitor of the F aith at Pa-
ris, and by him acquitted. There is also extant in the second Volume alike
Writ of King Francis, fol. 247. dated April 10, 1540. by which Authority is
granted to Joseph Corregie, a Βοᾶὶοι· of the same Order, to execute the Of-
fice of Inquisitor of the F aith throughout the whole Kingdom. In thethird
Volume‚ fol. 482. there is a royal Statute, bearing Date July 23,- 1543. by
which Bower is granted to the Ecclefiastical Judges and Inquisitors of the
Faith, to make Inquisltion against Lutherans and Hereticks‚ provided that
Laicks‚ and such who had not received holy- Orders, should be referred to the
ordinary Judges. There is also another Statute of Henry ΙΙ. dated at St,
Germain en Laye‚ June 22, 1550. by which theEdiet of Francis Ι. is recalled‚
and aMatthew Orry‚ Inquifitor of the Faith, delivered from the Trouble of
communicating to the supreme Courts‚ the Baillives and Seneschals, ¹such
Adtions as he brought against Hereticks‚ provided he communicated them
to the ordinary Diocesans or their Vicars. At the same Time that Power
was confirmed to him, by which he· was authorized to recover to a sound

Mind, either by Instruction or Admonition, such as erred from the F aith, (εἰ
