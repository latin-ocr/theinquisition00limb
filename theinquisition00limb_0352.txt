“ Cause. Finally, if the Crimina] be absolved‚ all his Effeets must be imme-
“ diately delivered to him. 4 Instrua‘l Tolet. cap. 22. As to perishable Effe&s‚
“‘ and which rnay grow worse by keeping, and such also as are too chargeable
“ to keep, viz. Cattle and SlaveS, the Receiver must sell 1116111 by Command
“ of the Inquisitors, without whose Permiffion nothing can be done.

‘⁴ When the neceffary Expences are deducted, the Surplus Money which
“ remains out ofthe Sale of the Effmsts, is to be depofited with the Seque—
“ strator, of which the Receiver must touch nothing till the Crimina] is con-
“ demned. As to other Things which may be kept, they are to be hired
‘⁶ out at reasonable Prices by the Receiver and Sequestrator. But these and
“ other the confiscated Effe&s, must not be sold but by Auerion, and then
“ go to the best Bidder. The same is to be observed as to the Effests which
“ are hired out. 2 Instrzffl. Hispal. cap. 9. In these Sales the Receiver must
“ use great Fidelity and Diligence, and though he promises after the Rate of
‘⁶ two or three per Cent. for the Recovery of any liffeim, yet when they are
“ recovered, he must allow only one.

“ When the Heretick is condemned, the Sequestrator must immediately
-“ deliver all the Effeets to the Receiver before two Notaries, nor can he re-
“ ceive or sell any Thing but in their Presence. But the Judge of the con-
“ fiscated Effe&s may at the Instances of the Receiver give Notice by the
“ Criers of the future Aufflon. -If any one thinks himself to be concerned in
“ it, he may, when he knows the Effe&s are to be sold, corne to the Judge
“ and demand his own, and sue for his Right. If no one comes, the immo-
-“ vable Effests are to be sold, and to be put up to Sale by Auffion the thir-
“ tieth Day, after the publick Notices, and other customary Things of the
“ City, before othe Receiver and other Parties concern'd.'’ 4Instru52. Talei.
Gagi- ἷξε to those Effeets which are disputed, they must not be sold by the
“ Receiver, till the Suit is finiihed. As to Effec'ts that are pawned, the Re-

“ the former Creditors first paid, and the Remainder carried into the 'lffreae
‘⁶ sury. 4 Infirma Tolet‚ Cap. 23. However, the Sale of the ἷοτῗ6116ἀΕίῖ6έ1τ3
‘⁶ is not to be deferred upon Account of Aetions, that do not appear to have
“ anyjust Foundation, but such Effe&s are to be sold, and such a Sum must be
“ deposited in the Sequestrator's Hands, that is equal to the Value of the
“ Debt sued for, and the Charges of the Suit. Farther, if there be any Ef-
“ fe&s which are to be in common between the Treasury and others,
“ they must be divided, *if it can be done conveniently : If it cannot, and it
“ appears better to sell them entire and without Divifion, the Treasury
“ hath the Privilege to order all of them to be sold by the Receiver, al·
