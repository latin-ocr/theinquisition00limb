Under Constantine the Emperor, when they were restored to full Liberty,
their Churches rebuilt‚ and the imperial Edicts every where published in their
Favour, they immediately began to discover what Spirit they were 0f; as
soon as ever they had the Temptations of Honour and large Revenues before
thern. Constantine's Letters are full Proof ofthe Jealousies and Animofities
that reigned amongst them. In his Letters to Miltiades Bishop of Rome he earm.
tells him, that he had been informed that Caecilianus Bilhop os Carzhage hade. 5·
been accused of many Crimes by some of his Collegues, Bishops of Africa, and
that it was very grievous to him to see so great a Number of People divided in-

'to Parties, and the Bishops disagreeing 'amongst themselves. And though them.

Emperor was willing to reconcile them by a friendly Reference of the Contro⁴³
versy to Miltiades and others, yet in spite of all his Endeavours they maintained
their Quarrels, and fac'tious Oppofition to each other, and through secret
Grudges and Hatred would not acquiesce in the Sentence of those he had ap-
pointed to determine the Affair. So that as he complained to Chrcssus Bishop of
Syracuse, those who ought to have maintained a brotherly Affeetion and peace-

⁴able Disposition towards each other, did in a scandalous and detestible Manner

leparate stom one another, and gave Occafion to the common Enemies of
·Christianity to deride and scoff at thern. For this Reason he summoned a
*Conncil to meet at Arles in Frunoe, that after an impartial hearing ofthe several
Parties‚ this Controversy which had been carried on for a long while in a very
intemperate Mamer, might be brought to a Friendly ⁴and Christian Compro-

mise. Euftbius farther adds, that he not only called together Councils in the se· De Vir.
‘veral Provinces upon account of the Qarrels that arose amongst the Biss10ps‚<†0n-1· 10
'but that he himself was present in them, and did all he could to promote Peacec· 44·
amongst them. However‚ all he could do had but little effe-ih and it must

be owned that he himself greatly contributed to prevent it, by his large En-
dowment of Churches, by the Riches and Honours which he conferi-ed on the
Bishops‚ and especially by his authorizing them to s1t as Judges upon the Con-
sciences and Faith of others, by which he confirmed them in a worldly Spirit,

the Spirit of Domination‚ Ambition, PrIde and Avarice‚ which hath in all

Ages proved fatal to the Peace and true Interest of the Christian Church.

In the first Edi& given us at large by Eusebius, published in favour of the ΕΗ lto:
Christians‚ he afted the part ofa wife, good, and impartial Govern0r‚ in‘· 5·
which, without mentioning any particular Seits, he gave full liberty to all
Chrffiians, y and to all other Persons whasoever, of following that Religion
which they thought best. But this Liberty was of no long Duration, and saon
abridged in reference both to the Christians and Heathens. For although
in this first mentioned Edi& he orders the Churches and Effcets of the Christi·
ans in general to be restored to them, yet in one immediately followng he
confines this Grant to the Catholick Church. After this, in a Letter to
Miltiades Bilhop of Rome, complaining of the Differences lomented by the
