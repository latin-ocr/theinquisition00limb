farther, Bzovius relate3‚ that Pope Martin endeavouring to diffunde Alexander, ξ 34
General of Lithuania‚ from giving any Affistance to the Bohenzinns‚ thus,
amongst other Things, writes to him in his Letter : But if you hove been any
Ways engaged hy Promiſse to undertake their Defence‚ know, that you could not
give your Faith to Hereticks‚ who are Violators eff the holy Faith, and that you will
fin mortally if you keep it, because a Believer can have no Communion with an
Infidel. What can be clearer? I shall add nothing farther in so evident a.
Matter. It is enough thatI have shewn that the F aith was violated by the
Council of Constance‚ the- Papists themselves being Judges, and indeed ap-
rovm it.

P chcffi Huſssand Jerome, and their Doekrine, being thns condemned,
Martin V. sent Letters to the Archbishops‚ Bishops‚ and the Inqnifitors of
heretical Pravity every where, beginning, Inter cunetas Pastorulis curce, in
which he telis them, That in the Kingdom of Romania, the Marquisate of Mo-
ravia, and the neighbouring Places, John Wickleff‚ John Huss, and Jerome of
Prague‚ Arch-heretz‘cks, had risten up, und that the Councilof Constance had conss
demned their Writings and Books. But whereas some of their Followers were in Pos-
fi’fflon of them3 he commands, that all such Persons, and all who approved their
Doblrines, and were their Abettors‚ should be delivered over ns Hereticks to the
secular Courts : ‘shut such who received them, if it were only through common Af«
fefflon² or the like Causes, should he stribily prohihited: Thai* the Impenitent should
be severely punished. He commands Princes to banish them their Dominions.- He
orders manifest Heretick5‚ though not condemned, to be punished‚ and even fizspei‘led
ones, if they would not canonically purge themselves. Hefarther commands the Prin<-
ces to obey the Inquzsttors. He orders suspelled Persons to he interrogated upon the
Articles of Wickleff and Huss, which he afterwards subjoins witht he interroga*
toties, and to be citedfor this Purpose. He commnnds this Bull to hepublish’d, and that
all Sundays and F estivals it fhould he publickly declared, that all Hereticks and their·
Abettors were excommunicaled. {shut all who held the Errorsof the eforefiiid Arch-
hereticks, ond their Ahettors, even though confffd, should be pzmished, tf they re-··
fuſsedto make ιι publick Abjureztion, orto undergo the Penance enjoined them. finally,
he repeals every Thing contrary herem. ³ ἱ

By this Decree the Inquifition was restored and established int the Kingdom
of Bohemia, whereby many were condemn’d of Heresy‚ and put to Death by
various Pnnifhments ι Some were burn'd alive, others thrown into the River,v

ty’d Hands and F eet, and so drowned ς and others destroy'd by different Me«
