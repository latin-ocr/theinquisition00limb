first Subscription was involuntary. So that Subscriptions cannot keep out any
Atheists, Infidels, or profligate Persons. And as to others. daily Experienee
teaches us, that they either disbelieve the Articles they subscribe, subscri-
bing them only as Articles of Peace; or else, that after they have subscribed
them, they see Reason‚ upon. a more mature Deliberation, to alter their
Minds, and change their original Opinione· So that till Men can be brought
always to εξ( upon Conscience, never to subscribe what they do not believe,
nor ever to alter their Jtidgment, as to the Articles they have subscribed ς Sub-
scriptions are as impertinent and useless as they are unreasonable, and can ne-
ver answer the Purposes of those who impose them.

But Ι apprehend farther, that this impofing of Subscriptions is not only an
unreafimable Custom, but attended with many very pernicious Consequences. It is
a great Hindiance to that Freedom arrd Impartiality of Inquiry which is the
· ‘unalterable Duty of every Man, and necessary to render his Religion rea·-
sonable and acceptable. For why should any Person make any Inquiries
for his own Information, when his Betters have drawn up a Religion for
him, and thus kindly saved him the Labour and Palus? And as his worldly
Interest may greatly depend on his doing as he is bid, and subscribing as he
is ordered ,· is it not reasonable to think that the generality will contentedly
take every thing upon Trust, and prudently refrain from creating to them-
selves Scruples and Doubts‚ by nicely examining what they are to set their
Hands to, least they should miss of Promotion for not being able to comply
with the Condition of it, or enjoy their Promotions with a dissatisfied and
uneasy Conscience ?

Subscriptions will, I own, sometimes prove Mas-ks of Distinetion, and as
Wans of Separation: For though Men of Integrity and Conscience may,
and ostentimes undoubtedly do submit to them ς yet Men of no Principles,
or very loose ones, worldly and ambitious Men, the Thoughtless and Igno.-
rant, will most certainly do it, when they find it for their Interest· The
Church that encloses her selfwith these Fences, leaves abundant Room for the
Entrance of Persons of such Charafiers. To whom then doth, {he refuse
Admittance? Why, if to any, it must be to Men who cannot bend their
Consciences to their Interest; who cannot believe, without Examination,
nor subscribe any Articles of Faith as true, without understanding and be· ⁷
lieving them. ’'sis in the very· Nature of Subscriptions to exclude none but
these, and to distinguilh such only sor Sharne and Punishment. Now how is
this conlistent with any Thing that is called Reason or Religion? If there
could be found out any wife and reasonable Methods to throw out of the
Christian Church and Ministry, Men who are in their Hearts Utibelievers,
who abide in the Church only for the Revenues she yields to them, who shift
their religious and political Principles, according to their Interest, who propa,-
gate Doarines inconsistent with the Liberties of Mankind, and are scandalous
and immoral in their Lives ; if Subscriptions could be made to answer these
Ends‚ and these only, and to throw Infamy upon such Men, and upon such
Men only 3 no one would have any Thing to alledge against the Usevvi them,
