trav. de haeret. c. 3. and cap. Inquifitores. de haeret„ lib. 6. John XXII, ordained

the same, when Matthew de Pontiniano, a Predicant, Inquifitor of hereticaleovius‚
Pravity in the Kingdom of Sicily, pronounced Sentence of &communicatione-132&
against G. de Balet0, Archdeacon of Forli, and Chaplain to the Pope. Butff- 9·
Pius IV. by an Extravagant, beginning, Romanus Pontifex, in the Year 1563.
ordained, that the Cardinals Inquifitors General over all Christendom, might:

that under grievous Penalties; that so when the Process is formed, it may be
reported to the most holy Lord‚ and that the deserved and just Punilhment may

be publilhed against them.

As to such Religious as were exempt, there was formerly a great Variety Direff.

about the Power of proceeding against them. For Alexander IV. by a cer· par. 3· ι
tain Rescript‚ beginning, Ne commz'ffoe vobis, Anno 1260. ordained, that theQ¹·²8,’
Inquifitors should proceed, without Distinffion, against all manner of reli-(⁰⁷⁷²'77‘⁹
gious and exempt Persons whatsoever. The same also was ordained by others.
But Pius 11. about the Year 1460. granted to the Vicar of the Order of the
Friars Minors, that he should make Inquisltion, and punish his own Friars
suspedted concerning the Faith, or of Heresy. A few Years after Sixtus or*
dained by a golden Bull, beginning, Sacri praedicatorum 3 which may be seen
in the Book of the Privileges of the Predicant Order, fol. 163. that the Fre„
dicants shall not proceed against the F riars Minors, nor the Minors against
the Predicants‚ in those Places where they exercise the Office of the Inquisi-
ti0n. A few Years after this, Innocent VIII. forbid all the Inquifitors to pro-
ceed in any Manner, or make Inquifition against the Friars Minors, as ap·
pears from the Apostolick Letters written about this Affair‚ contain'd in a
Book entitled, Fundamentum trium Ordinum beati Francisci.

But whereas these Immunities were sometimes manifestly dangerous to the
Faith, the later Popes have subjected all religious or otherwise exempted
Persons, in the Cause of Faith, as formerly, to the Inquifitors of heretical
Pravity. Thus Clement VII. by a Rescript‚ beginning, Cum ficut 3 and Pit155i1nam²
IV. by another beginning, Pastoris [eterni ; for which Reason it was declaredtzt. 34·
by Charles V. Emperor in Spain, That the Soldiers of St. James‚ if theyff' 32·
should happen to be Hereticks, are not exempted from the ordinary Jurisdi-
ction, nor from that of the Inquifitors. The same Rule also is entirely to be
observed as to the Soldiers of St. John, and as to all others whatsoever.

In some particular Religions, the Order is prescribed, which must be ob-
served in denouncing heretical or suspected Friars 3 whereby the Prior of the
Convent must make the Denunciation to the provincial, the Provincial to the
General, and the General to the‘Office of the Inquifition. But that this
round about Way may be avoided, when this Method cannot be so con-
veniently observed, the Prior alone may make the Denunciation, or any

·{th{r1in³<i¹i8R00m upon his Absence, that the Cause of Faith may not
