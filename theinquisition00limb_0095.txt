them first to use all Endeavours to recover him ·, but that if he pefyhffeti in [η’] Per.
verjeness, thev should punish him according to their Office, ond the Pocae>- [hev hard
receivedfrom‘God, to prevent his giving any Disturbance to the Cha-2712, and [221² the
latter endfhould be worft than the first. The Ministers of the Church of Rern
were of the same Opinion, and in their Letter to the Magistrates of Getta-a sav,
We pray the Lord that he would give you the spirit of Prudmzce, Cemgfel and Strefrgth,
to remove this Plague from the Churches‚ both your own and ethers, and advise thern
to negleit nothing that may bejudged unworthy a Chrzstian Affagistrate to omit. The
Ministers of Zurich give much the same Advice, and thought that there was
need of a great deal ofDiligence in the Affaix· 3 especially as the reformed Churches
were evil thought of, amongst other Reasons, for this, as being thehgjelves herem-al,
and Favourers ofHereticks. But that, as the Prot·idence of God had given them cm
Opportunity oswiping off so evil a Suspicion, and preventing the forfher spreadozg of
sb contagious a Porsen, they did not doubt but their Excellencies would he coteste! to im-
prove it. Those of Scaffhustm subscribed to the Judgment of those of Zm’iclg
and declare, that they did not doubt, but that their Prudence would put a
stop to the Attempts of Servetus‚ lest his Blasphemies‚ as a Canker, should
eat up the Members of Christ ; adding 'these remarkable words, That to endea-
vour tot oppoft‘ his Dreams by a train of Reasoning, what would it be, but to gro-w mad
with assMadman.

These Extrafss, which are taken out of the Letters printed at the End of‘
Calvin’s Institutions‚ clearly demonstrate, that he adted‘serioussy and delibe-
rately in the Affair of Servetus‚ and that he consulted the neighbouring
Churches5· and had their Opinion of the Lawfulness and Expediency of putting·
him to Death for his Herefies. And though it doth not wholly excuse his
Fault, yet it ought in Justice to be allowed as an Abatement and Extenu-
ation of it3 and, lthink‚ evidently proves, what his Enemies are very un-
willing to allow, that he was not transported by Rage and Fury, and did not
a& meerly from the Diffiates of Envy and Malice‚ but from a mistaken Zeal
against what he accounted Blaspherny and Heresy, and with the concurrent
Advice of his Brethren in the Ministry‚ and Fellow-Lahourers in the great
Work of the Reformation. AndI think his eminent Services to the Church
of God, both by his Preaching and Writings, ought, notwithstanding all his*
F'ailings, to secure to his Memory the Honour and Respe& that is doe to it.
For he deserved well of all the reformed Churches, and was an eminent Instru-
ment in the Hand of Providence, in promoting the great and glorious KVork
of saving Men from the gross Errors, Superstitions‚ and Ide-latries of the
Romish (burch. And as 1 thought my sels obliged impartially to represent
these Things as they appear'd to me, Ι hope all who love to (hstinguill1 them-
selves by Calvin’s Name, will be careful not to imitate him in this great Ble-
mist] of his Life3 which‚* in reality, hath tarnilh’da Charafter‚ that would
otherwise have appeared amongst the frrst and- brightest of the Age he‘
lived in.

In the Year 1632. after Calvin’s‘Death5 one Nicholas Anthoine was condemn-
ed also by the Councll- of Geneva to be first hanged‚ and afterwards, burno*
