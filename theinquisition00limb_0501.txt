Torture to find out the Truth.
The Circumstances are such as these. If the Persons inquifited are learnedssarena,

110111 distant Countries. These Things render the Person vehemently 1111066160,
3110 116 may be tortured concerning his Intention and Belief of 1161611631 Pro·
pofifions, and his Accomphces, 110111 whom he had the BookS, and may be
forced to abjure upon account of the vehement Suspicion, and be 0311111160
31 the Pleasure of the Inquifitors. Such who write out the Books 01 Here-sousa 43,
ticks‚ in order to print and publish them, and such who fell Paper and Ink for
such Writing and Printing‚ if it be knowingly, are Favourers of Hereticks,
and may be arbitrarily punished. Nor is he free from Punishment whoC aaaaaa
reads and retains the Book of an Heretick, profeffedly containing Heresy‚”· 28, 29⁴
or treating of Religion, although he doth it with a Defign to confute the
Errors of it, and the holy Office is apprised of such Defign. For Instance,
if an House be searched, and prohibited Books are found in it, and at the
same time such Writings as recite 1116 Paffages of such Book5‚ and confute
the Errors of them ; although such a Person is free from all Suspicion of He-
resy, and tnust not therefore be tortured or made to abjure, yet 116 13 to be
punilhed‚ and falls into the Excommunication of the Bull de Caemz, because
he keeps the said Books without Leave‚ and by his own Authority‚ but must
therefore be absolved from it again.

This Interdiel of reading prohibited Books is so universal, that it compre-
hends even the Clergy themselves, and as most contenti, the Bishops 3110 very
Cardinals‚ who cannot read the said Books without the Pope’s Licence ; be-
cause all Licences and Privileges were revoked by Julius III. in a Constitution,
beginning, Cum meditatim and afterwards by a Constitution of Paul IV. be—
ginning, Cumfuturum ·, and of Pius IV. Cumpro munere 3 and by a Constitution
of Gregory XV. publiffied Dec. 30. 162 3. beginning, Apostolatzts ffcium3 and
finally by aConstitution of Urhasz VIII. published Ap. 11. 1631. this Revo-
cation was often confirmed. Hence it is that this Penalty is appointed against
the Clergy who retain and read prohibited Books, that they are vehemently
suspected, may be deprived of the active and paffive Voice, suspended 110111
divine Services‚ deprived of the Offices of Reading, Preaching‚ &a and
farther be enjoined Fastings, Pilgrimages‚ &a

As to the lnquifitors‚ some will have them not to be comprehended in the η, ις,
Bull 3 others, that they are 33 well as others, unless they have particular
Leave from the Pope himself, or the Congregation of the 0310111313 01 the
holy Office, who alone have the Power of giving this Licence, and not this
unless it be in full Congregation‚ or at least not without the major Part of the 9-
0310111313 be present. And even this their Power some fo far restrain, as to
contend that the College of Cardinals cannot grant it during the Vacancy of
the See. But whatever the Power of the Cardinals Inquisltors General in this sousa,1. 1,--
