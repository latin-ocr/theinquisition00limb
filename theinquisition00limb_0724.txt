ceive a certain Heretick or relapsed Person out of their Court, whom they will
deliver to him ·, andthat he must give publicl: Notice the same Day, or the
Dav before in the Moruing, by the Crier, throughout the City, in all the
usual Places and Streets‚ that on such a Day and Hom, and in such 3 Place,
the inquisitor will make a Sermon for the Faith, and that the Bishop and In·
quisitor will condemn a certain Heretick or Relapse, by delivering him to the
secular Court.

In most of the Tribunals of the Inquifition, especially in Spain, 'tis a re-
markable Custom they use, viz. on the Day before the Ac'ts of Faith, solemn-

i-*arasz-ly to carry a Bush to the Place of the Fire, with the Flames of which they

t 3- ⁶- 10·are consumed, who deserve the punishment of being burnt. This is not without

fec'tible Splendor of the Church, which burns, andis not consumetis and be-
sides this, it {ignifies Mercy towards the Penitent, and Severity towards the
Froward and Obstinate. And farther, it represents how the Inquisitors defend
the Vineyard of the Church, wounding with the Thorns of the Bush, and
burning up with Flames all who endeavour to bring Heresies into the Harvest
of the Lord·sFie1d. And finally, it points outtheObstinacy and Froward-
ness ofHereticks, which must rather be broken and bent, like a rugged and
stubborn Bush, and that as the Thorns and Prickles of the Bush tear the

publick A& of Faith‚ they part with their Hair and their Beard, by which
the Inquifitors represent, that Hereticks return to that Condition in which
they were born, viz. becoming the Children of Wrath.

All Things being thus prepared to celebrate this A& of Faith, all the Pri-
soners, on that very Day which is appointed for the Celebration of ir, are
cloathed with that Habit which they must wear in the publick Proceffion.
But the Custom in this Matter is not altogether the same in all the Inquifi-
tions. In that of (ἶσα, the Jayl-Keepers‚ about Midnight, go into the Cells
of the Prisoners, bring in 3 burning Lamp to each of them, and a black
Garment striped with white Lines3 and also a Pair of Breeches, which reach
down to their Aukles, both which they order them to put on. The black
Habit is given them in Token of Griefand Repentance. About two a Clock
the Keepers return, and carry the Prisoners into a long Gallery, where they
are all placed in a certain Order against the Wall, no one of them being per-
mitted to speak a Word, or mutter, or move ; so that they stand immovable,
like Statues‚ nor is there the least Motion of any one of their Members to be
seen, except of their EyeS. All these are such as have confeffed their Fault,
and have declared themselves willing to return by Penance to the Bosorn of the
²Church of Rome. To every one of these is given a Habit to put over their
black Garment. Penitent Hereticks, or such as are vehemently suspected,
-received the blessed Sackcloth, commonly called the Sambeniw, which, as we
have before related, is of a Saffron Colour, and on which there is put the
