walk two and two to the Church of St. Peter, and there pray, in that Habit

which should be injoined them for this Purpose ·‚ and in the same Order should

also go to the Church of the Convent os St. Mary supra Minervam, where

they should put off their Habit‚ and every one sreely return to his own Place.

When they had received this Habit and Penance, the aforesaid Masters Paul
and John absolved thern all, wh0, after Absolution, went to the two Churches

aforesaid, the Pope seeing the whole Ceremony in the new Rooms, and grant-
ing them his Bleffing. The Habit which these Moors were injoined to wear,
was of this Form. Upon their ordinary Garments there was a red or purple
Cloath, hanging over their Shoulders upon their Breasts and Backs, quite
down totheir Hips‚ having on ita yellow Cross four Fingers wide, and of
the same Length with the Cloath it self. Every one of them went to the Al-
tar of the aforesaid Church of St. Mary ad Minervam, and there laid down the
aforesaid Cloath, which the Friars received, and hung up on high in the
Church, to preserve the Memory osthat Affair.

ᾼ. 1498· ness our Lord the Pope, was kept in Jayl, being defamed for Mahometanism

length the said Lords Commiffaries did, on Wednesday, Sept. 14. report the
Process and Depofitions os the Witneffes to our holy Lord the Pope, in a
private Conslstory. Alexander, when he understood the Affair, by the Ad-
vice os the most Reverend Lords the Cardinals‚ deprived Aranda of the E-
piscopal Dignity, and of all his Benefices and Offices, and deposed and de·
graded him froin all his Orders; and being thus deprived, deposed, and de·

How the Solemnity of a general Sermon or A& os Faith was formerly ob·
served, plainly appears from the Book of the Sentences of the Tholouse Inqui-
sition. The People being called together into the Church, and after the
preaching the Sermon concerning the Faith, the A& commenced by an Oath,
which the Inquisitors gave to the Civil Magistrates, by which they promised
their Affistance to discover and apprehend Hereticks, and to accuse and de-
nounce them to the Inquisitors ς and finally conclude, And in these and all other
Things which belong to the Office of the Inqmfition, we will be obedient to God, and
the Church of Rome, and the Inqug'fitors. This Oath, as appears by compa-
ring the several Sermons together, was afterwards somewhat enlarged, that
ῐὴῗ Magistrates might not have the least Pretence for conniving at He-
re y.
