ced an Heretick, but condemned as tho’ he was one. But if upon the Expiw
ration of the Year he appears, he is heard as far as relates to the excufing hist
Crime, and testifying his Innocence 3 but not in order to recover his Effects,
unless he can make his Innocence, or some other just Impedirnent legally ap-
pear. If he is in sacred Orders, heis fifst degraded, by a verbal Degradation
only, because he cannot be aEtually degraded, inasmuch as he is absent. But
Eymericus thinks, that the Person, thusdegraded, is not to be left to the se-
cular.A.rm, butthatif he will repent, he may freely, and without the Qe-
stion be admitted to Mercy and Abjuration.- .
egna, in This whole Affair is prescribed the Inquifitors of Spain, by a certain-

Zaa. first Instruffion, Cap. 19. They have likewzse decreed, that the Inquisitors may
paug-b proceedagainst Criminals in the said Crime of Heresy, altho’ absent, by citing the

aforesaid? absent Peifhns hy publick Ediets, which they shall cause-to· he publilhedvand
fastned to the Doors of the principal Church of the Place or Places where they dwelt.
'Now the Inqazsstors may form Proceffes against Absenteeschy one of these *three- ways.. ·
first, according as 'ti52prescribed, Cap. cum contumacia, cle haeret.lib.6*.1viz..
by citing and admonishing the Ahst’ntees to appear to defend themselves, and answer,
according to Law, upon certain Articles relating to the Faith, and upon a certain
Crime of Heresy, δῖε. under Pain of Excommunication, with their Admonitions in
Form. But if he deth not appear, they shall command the Promotor Fiscal to accuse >⁷
him cf Contumacy, and to demand sIndz'ttmmts or Bills more fully charged, by which·-
he may he (lenounced. But zf , he continues-in his Ohstinacy for the Space of a Year,
they may declare him‘ an Heretick in Form of Law. And this *Method of-Pr00
cess is the safcst, and least severe. The second way is this, T hat if it fhall appear to
the Inqmfitom, that the Offence ought to befully proved against any Absentee, they
may cite him hy Ediets, as aforesaid„ to come and answer and declare according to
his Rigai, and to she-w his Innocence with-in 305Days,¹ divided into three Ternas„
every,Term-,confistingqf ten Days 3 or they may allow them a longer Time, if they,
think proper, according ⁸to the Distance or Remoteneſs of the Places, in which ’tis or
may hepresumed that the aforesaid cited Persons dwell 3 whom they ought to cite to
,all the-Acts of the Proceyi, even to the definitive Sentence inclufively ·, in which Cast,
ff the Criminal doth not appear, his Contumacy shall be complained of in all the Terms

of the Edicit, and the Inqaifitors may receive his Denunciation and Accusation from. ⁵

the Fistal, ancl draw up his Process in Form. And when all this is done, if the Crime-
appears to hesufficiently proved, they may condemn =theAbsentee, without waiting for*
iam, any longer, ‘T he third Method to he ohserved in drawing, up the Process against
the Ahſsentee, is this ς that if in the Management of the Process made in the Inquifiw
tion, there appears to he a Presumption of Heresy against the Absentee, altho' the
Crime deth. not seem to hefully proved, , yet the Inquifitors may order an Edit? against
ficch Ahftntee noted and suspected of the Crime of Heresy‚ and command him to ap-
pear within a certain Time to fi‘eehimfi’lf, and. canonically to purge himself from the
said Error or Crime ,avith this Addition, that if he doth not appear to receive and -„
perform the aforestzid Canonical Purgation, or deth not free or parge himself, they
will look on him as a ConviH, and proceed to ac‘t according to Lazo. And this Form
if Process is a little toosevere5 but still ’tis rightly founded upon Law, and prudent
