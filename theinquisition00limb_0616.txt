cap. 50. then the Witneffcs thus produced by the Criminal have deposed before the-
Inquisitor, a Copy of theirDepositions is given to the Procurator ofthe Exche-
quer, who, in his Turn, exhibits his Interrogatories uponv them, that the·
NVitneffes brought by the Prisoner in his Defence, may be examined upon*
them. And here, just as the Criminals Advocate doth, he asks abundanoe
of Questions about the Witness‘es Person, Condition of Life, and whether
they know the Criminal, or are any ways a-kin to him? and the like„
Belides this he is asked, How he came to put himself upon this present Ex-
amination ?·· Whether any Body defired him to do it ? And who? With what
Words ? And what he the said WVitness answered ? Whether the Articles upon
which he was to beexamined, were shewn him? Or whether he hath been
otherwise instrueted what« to depose? Whether any Thing hath been given,
promised, or forgive-n him, and what? Whether he expedis any Advantage.
by 'his present Deposition, or by the Delivery of the Prisoner out of the JayI
ofthe· holy Office, and what? To these-he adds others suitable to the Affair,
and thus running over every Article produced' by the Criminal, he demands
that his Witnesses be interrogated upon each of them.

agap. 52. The Procurator os the Exchequer of the supream Senate of the general Ro-
man inquisition, usually demands at the End of his Interrogatories, that the In-
quisitor, who is to examine the Witneffes, will form other proper Interroga-
tories‚ as the Matter shall require, and the Answers of the Witnesses ffiall
make neceffary. For it often happens, that· as the W'itneffes are examffling,
such Things are saidby them, as give Occafion to new Interrogatories, so
necessary and suitable to the Case as tends very much to discover the
Truth.

'Tis sometimes the Custom, as¹¹ Pegna tells us, for the Procurator ofthe Ex-
chequer of the holy Inquifition, at the End of his Interrogatories, to put such
an Interrogatory as this against a Crimina] to his Witness. Whether hesknows,
or harh heard it said, that-the said N. in the said City of· Ns was accounted as
one suspe&ed of Heresy, and a Man of an ill character, Opinion and Fame, .
‚in Matters relating to the holy Catholick Faith? Irhe answers Yes, he is
asked how he came to know this, and must name the Errors and Herefies, who
were 'Witnefl'es with him, at what Time, what the particular Place, all
which he must particularly relate. 151 he answersv No, heis interrogated„
How ’tis poffible that the said N. should ‘be accounted assonet suspeeted ofHe-
resy, and otherwise of evil Life, Condicion and Fame, in Matters appertain-
ing to the holy Catholick Faith, and yet he ehe said Witness should be igno-
rant of it ? Pegna adds, that the second Part of-this Interrogatory seems to
him very dangerous, and proper only to invalidate the Evidence of the Wit-
nessfor the Criminal. For· if such Witness ssiould answer, 'tis poffible that
N. may have been suspeCied of Heresy, and yet that he might be ignorant
os it, his Evidence would be weakned. And altho’ some Doctors greatly ad-
mire such anInterrogatory, and say that 'tis a most excellent and admirable
one, and what willinvalidate the Depositions os almost allWitneffes for the
Criminal, yet heis rather of Opinion, that if such an Interrogatory should be
