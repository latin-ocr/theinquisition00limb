baniihed for this Reason to the Issand Pontia. Dion the Historian’s Account of 1. 67. in
this Affair is somewhat different. ‘¹ ‘⁶ He tells us, That Fabius Clemens theDomit·

⁴⁶ Consul, Domitian’s consui, who had married Flavia Domitilla, a near Re-

'“ lation of Domitian, was put to Death by him, and Dornitilla banished

‘⁶ to Pandataria, being both accused ofAtheism ·, and that on the same Ac·

‘⁶ count many who had embraced the Jewish Rites were likewise condemned,

“ some of whom were put to Deam, and others had their Estates confisca-

“ ted.” Ι think this Account can belong to no other but the Christians,

¹‘whom Dion seems to have confounded with the Jews ; a Millake into which he

and others might naturally fall, because the first Christians were Jews, and

came from the Land of Judea. The Crime with which these Persons were
charged was Atheism·‚ the Crime commonly imputed to Christians, because

-thev refused to worship the Roman DeitieS. And as there are no Proofs‚ that
Donzitian ever persecuted the Jews upon account of their Religion, nor any
Intimation of this Nature in Jost’phus, who finished his Antiquities towards the

latter end of Domitian’s Reign ·, Ι think the Accounr of Eusebius, which he de·

‘clares he took from Writers, who were far from being Friends to Christianity‚

is preferable to that of Dion’s·‚ and that therefore these Persecutions by Domi-

tian were upon account of Christianity. However, they did not last long, for. E. H. 1..3.
as Eusebius tells us, he‘put a Stop to them by an Edi& in their favour. Tertul- 0- 20·
lian also affirms the same, and adds, that he recalled those whom he had ba1AP⁰¹·⁰·5’
nished. So that though this is reckon’d by Ecclefiastical Writers as the second ·
Persecuti0n‚ it doth not appear to have been general, or very severe. Domi· ΒΨ· ¹¹²,

Under Trajan, otherwise a most excellent Prince‚ began the third Persecu- ” ’

soever they might have been suspested before. From this imperial Rescript it
is abundantly evident, that this Persecution oi the Christians by Trajan was
purely on the Score of their Religion, because he orders, that whosoever was
accused and convisted of being a Christian should be punilhed with Death‚
unless he renounced his Profeffion‚ and sacrificed to the Gods. All that was re·
