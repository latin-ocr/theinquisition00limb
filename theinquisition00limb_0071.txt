Under the Reign of this Emperor, the Arians also, in their Turn, used
the Orthodox with no greater Moderation, than the Orthodox had used them,
The Vandals, who were partly Pagans, and partly Arians, had seized on Spain
and Africa, and exercised innumerable Cruelties on those who were not of the
same Religion with themselves, Trasimond their General in Spain, and Gense-
rick in Africa, used all poffi ble Endeavours to propagate Arianism throughout
all their Pr‘ovinces. And the more effestually to accomplish this Defign, they
filled all Places with Slaughter and Blood, by the Advice of the Bishops of
the-ir Party, burning down Churches, and putting the orthodox Clergy to the
most grievous and unheard of Tortures, to make them discover the Gold and
Silver of their Churches, repeating these kind of Tortures several times, so
that-many astually died under them. Genserick seized on all the sacred Books
he could find, that they might be deprived of the Means of defending their
Opinions. By the Counsel ofhis Bishops, he ordered that none but Arians

’ should be admitted to Court, or employ'd in any Offices about his Children,

 

or so much as enjoy the Benefit of a Toleration. Armoggstes, Masculon‚ and
Saturus, three Officers of his Court, were inhumanly tortured to make them
embrace Arianism; and, upon their refusal, they were stripped of their Ho-
nours and Estates, and forced to protraCt a miserable Life in the utmost Po·
verty and Want. These and many more Instances of Genserick’s Cruelty to-
wards the Orthodox, during a long Reign of thirty eight Years, are related by·

During these TransaCtions, a new Controversy‚ of a very extraordinary*
and important Nature, arose in the Church‚ which, as the other had done
before, occasioned many Disorders and Murthers, and gave Birth to the third
general Council. Nestorius, the persecu-tingB-ishop of Constantinople,altho'tole- Evag.E.H.'

only the Distinetion of the two Natures in Christ, for he allowed the 'proper
Personality and Subfistence ofthe Logos, but that there were also two distinct
Personsin Christ; the one a mere Man, absolutely distinEtfrom the Word,

and the other God, as absolutely distinet from the human Nature. This caused Th1·rdge„e.·
great Disturbances in the City of Constantinople‚ and the Dispute was thought ramum-1⁴1,
of such Consequence, as to need a Council to settle it. Accordingly ‘Theodofius A. C. 434·
