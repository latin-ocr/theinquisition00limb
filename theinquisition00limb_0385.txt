The HtsToRY ofthe INQUISITION. 2¹7

And finally, the Emperor Frederick hath commanded by the same Law, all
Go'vernors‚ as well Ecclefiastical as Secular, kindly to receive the Inquisitors,
and defend them against the Incurfions of Hereticks‚ §. 10. We hereby declare,
thatwe lake under our special and Imperial Proteciion the preaching Friars of the

= Predicant Order, deputed for the Affair of the Faith against Hereticks in the seven

ml parts of our Empire ; as also all others st’nt for, and who come tojudge Heretickr‚
unless any ‘ff them be proscribed by the Empire, where-ever they go, aeide, or re-
turn ·, and ’tis our Pleoficre that they receive no Offence from any, but that they re·

’ ceive the Affistance, and have the Recommendation of all the Faithful of the Empire.
³ PVetherefore command you, and allos you, thot wheresoever, and to whomfhever of

you they come, ye receive them kindly‚ and preserve their Persons free from the In-

, curfions of Hereticks that lie in waitfor them, and that ye grant them all Counsel,

fizfe Condufi, and Affistmm, in their Execution of Affairs so acceptable before
Gosshe Inquifitors may also exa& an Oath from the Magistrates‚ for their
observing not only the Laws of the Emperor Frederick against Hereticks, butam· 3,

κ all other Statutes as wellEcclefiastical as Secular, as appears from two Rescripts
¹ of InnocentIV. beginning, Orthodoxce fidei. The same hath been particular-

 

ly decreed by the Council of Biterre, cap. 3 1. And that by the Help of the Lord
Heresy may be the better cmd more speedily extirpated, and the Faith planted in the
Earth‚ see that the S tatutes and Laws made concerning these Yhings by the Apostolick
See, and its Legates, and the Princes, be most exaHly observed.

As there are many Difficulties that daily arise in the Punishment of Here-Direa-
ticks, and the Causes of F aith, which are not fully and plainly determined bypart. 3·
the Laws, for this Reason, and to prevent the N ecesfity ofconsulting the Pope‘l'g'² ⁸¹52·
in all doubtful Cases, Innocent IV. by a Rescript, beginning, Cum negotium :co ' ’
and Alexander IV. by another, beginning, Prce cunHis, gave to the Inquisi-
tors free Power of interpreting the Ecclefiastical and Secular Statutes against
Hereticks‚ their Believers, F avourers, &a as often as there appears in them
any Thing ambiguous or obscure. This is certainly a very large Power,
which the Seville Instruffions have also granted to the Inquifitors. Inst. 1.

{Simonem observes here, “ Tchat smaller Matters only, and such as ’tis im- Tit. 340
“ poffible to bring within the Laws, are left to the Determination of thes> 34> 351

⁴ “ Inqui‘fitors, and that they cannot of themselves decide Matters of greater

“ Moment, which the Laws have not, but that they must consult the Inqui-
“ fitor General and Senate about them. He adds, that even as to those

= “ Things which are left to themselves, they must notjudge according to their

“ own Will and Pleasure, but conformable to the Statutes and Laws3 nor

“ follow their own Conscience, unless it be entirely informed by the Laws.” ¹
[Paramus is of the same Mind with Simancas, altho', as he says, ‘⁶ The Words Lib. 2· Μ

“ of the Seville Instruction, cap. 28. seem to imply the contrary. For thus²·⁶'²p·3‡·c
