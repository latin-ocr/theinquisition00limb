ofthe Catholick Faitsbfor their own Errors, and their damnable Sem, and deth ex-
communicate, persecute, and damn them. Nor is he lightly to be believed, who says
he was ignorantes it.

By this Decrce any Fac‘ts are made Signs, by which a Person may be judg-
ed to be a Beiiever osHereticks. But because no Inference can be made con-
cerning any Man’s Faith with equal Certainty and Strength from every one of
these Facts, the Popish Doclors make use osa Distinction. For, say they, there
are some Facis in which the Error is manifestly exprefled, which cannot by
any Means be taken in a good Meaning 3 viz. to do Reverence to thern ac-
cording to their Custom, and to receive the Communion from them after their
Manner. These Things demonstrate a Person ro be an Heretick‚ and he may
be proceeded against as such. For they say the Plea can hardly be allowed,
that he did these Things for the sake of some temporal Profir, and not out of
any real Error of Mind. There are other Things which occafion violent Sus-
picions: As when any one defamed for, or suspected of Heresy, seeks Conso-
lation from Hereticks, according to their Manner at the Time of Death. If
any one doth this, the Law presumes him an Heretick‚ and against this Pre-
sumption no Proof can be regularly admitted. Other Things there are, in
which there is no Appearance of any heretical Rite, such as to visit Hereticks,
give them F ood, accompany them, defend their Persons‚ and the like. These
Things demonstrate no Man to be an Heretick‚ but only render him suspected
of Heres .

Amongst others Signs by which the Valdenfi’s may be known, is the Refu-
sal osan Oath, when they are compelled to it by the Inquifit0r33 because
they hold every Oath in every Case to be unlawful. Thus we read, If any

(Ἀρ, Ex· os them, thro' a damnable Obstinacy, refuse the Solemnity of cm Oath, and will not

com. itaqu sware, from this alone they are to be accounted Hereticks,

There are other Believers of Hereticks, concerning whom 'tis not evident

Affiiz'iinizis. that they believe their Errors, but who appear to believe the Words,Commands,

and Works of Hereticks, Such are they who commit those Facis in which
there is no Appearance of any infidel Rite ς who go and come at their Corn-
mand, hear, tho’seldom, their Sermons, carry their Letters here and there,
wait on them, receive their Books without burning them, carry them Provi-
fion, afford thern safe Conduch visit them, and do. other Things in which there⁴
is nothing of any heretica] Custom.

Such are neither looked on nor treated as Hereticks, though they bring
themselves under Suspicion greater or less, in Proportion‚ as the “Appear-
ances are greater or less. Wherefore they deal with them as with suspected
Persons‚ of whom afterwards. 'Tis here enquired, whether a Person, who
hath heard the Sermons of Hereticks, once or twice, ought ro be accounted·
for a Believer of Hereticks. The common Opinion is, that he ought nor to

be accounted such for once or twice hearing the Sermons of Hereticks, unless. γ

he hath done itoftener. However, they distinguish. If any Catholick, living,
in the Country of Hereticks, goes once or twice to their Sermons, he is not
to be judged to be a Believer of thern,⁸ But isin Catholick Countries he knphvg}
