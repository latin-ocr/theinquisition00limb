oftener? If oftener‚ they don’t eafily believe the Criminal, affirming his
good Intention and Belief; because the oftener an heretical Propofition wag
unered, there arises a greater Srffpicion, that both his Intention and Faith
were bad.

Carena also advises the Inquifitors to use great Caution in the Examination
of Priests guilty of Solicitation, that they may not make the Confeffors by
their Interrogatories reveal those Things which fall under the Seal of Secresy.
He tells us of a Case that happened in a certain Inquffirion, that when the
Process was sent to the sacred Congregation‚ and their Eminencies the Fathers
had confidered it, they commanded every Thing to be erased out of it, which
in the least savoured of the Breach of the Seal.

ally repeated three times by the Inquifitor. But 'tis in the Inquifitor’s Plea-
sure to admonish and examine them oftener‚ especially when they think the
Prisoners refuse to discover the Truth out of Wickedness‚ or don’t remember
those Things of which they are denounced. In the supream Inquifition at
Rome Criminals are brought into Court to Audience, examined, and admo·
nilhed, not only thrice‚ but five times, and sometimes seven, and sometimes
thrice within ten Days. Others, especially young Persons accused of heinous
Crhnes, are examined and admonished thrice only. From whence they draw
these Rules. 1. When the Person accused is taken up, the Inquifitor must
examine and interrogate him frequently concerning those Things which he
denies, but which are proved, or of which there are vehement Suspicione
that he is guilty, till he will say nothing more, either by confeffing or deny-
ing, and his Cause is therefore concluded. 2. It is then proper to admoniih
and interrogate the Criminal several times, when he either denies the Crimes
objeetedto him, or partly denies, and partly confesses them, or if there a·
rise new Evidence and Proofs. 3. 'Tis left to the Pleasure of the Inquifitors,
how often the Criminal shall be brought up, admonished‚ and examined‚ and
in a doubtful Case ’tis safest often to admonish and examine him. 4. Altho’
'tis not determined by any particular Law, and three Admonitions ought to
be made within the first ten Days after :Imprisonment, yet 'tis safe, that ‘soon
after the Criminals are sent to Jayl‚ they should be brought to Audience,
admoniihed and interrogated, and that other Examinations should be rnade
a-few Days after, whilst their Memories are fresh. But their -PraCtice is di-
reffly contrary to this Advice, for the Prisoners are detained in the Jayls of
the Inquisition several Years‚ and 'tis very often an whole *Yean before they
‘are again examined, after the three first Admonitions.
