Religion or Truth‚ as to torment and destroy others for the sake ofit, unless
tempted with the Views of worldly Ambition‚ Power and Grandure. These
Views will have the same Influence upon all bad Minds, whether of the Priest-
hood or Laity, who, when they are determined at all Hazards to pursue them,
-will use all Methods‚ right or wrong, to accompliss] and secure them.

As therefore the Truth of History obliges me to compliment the Laity with
>the Honourof this excellent Invention‚ for the Support and Propagation of
Religion ·, and as its Continuance in the World to this Day is owing to the Pro-
teftion and Authority of their Laws, and to certain political Ends and Purpo-
ses they have to serve thereby, the loading the Priesthood only, or principal-
ly, with the Infamy and Guilt of it, is a mean and groundless Scandal; and
to be perpetually objecting the Cruelties that have been practised by some who
have called themselves Chriffians, on others for Conscience sake, as an Argu-
ment against the Excellency of the Christian Religion, or with a View to pre-
judice others against it, is an Artifice unworthy a Person of common Un-
derstanding and Honesty. Let all equally share the Guilt, who are equally
chargeable withit ; and let Principles be judged of by what they are in them-
selves‚ and not by the Abuses which bad Men may make of them ε Ifany Ar-
gument can be drawn from these, we may aslwell argue against the Truth
and Excellency of Philosophy, because Cicero espoused the PrInciples of Perse-
cution, and Antoninus the Philosopher authorized all the Cruelties attending it.
But the Question in these Cases is not, what one who calls himselfa Philosopher
or a Christian doth, but what true Philosophy and genuine Christianity lead to
and teach ·, and ifl'ersecution be the natural Effeci: of either of them, ’tis nei-
ther in my Inclination or Intention to defend them. But I pass from these Re-
·flections to the History of Christian Persecutions.

Of the Pe7seczctions amongst Christians upon Account (gf Religion.

I F any Person was to judge of the Nature and Spirit of the Christian Reli⁶
gion, by the Spirit and ConduCt only of too many who have profeffed to
believe it in all Nations, and almost throughout all Ages of the Christian
Church, he could scarce fail to censure it as an Institution unworthy the God of
Order and Peace, subverfive of the Welfare and Happiness of Societies, and
designed to enrich and aggrandize a Few only, at the Expence of the Liberty,

Reason, Consciences, Substance, and Lives of others„ For what Confusmns

and Calamities, what Ruins and Desolations‚ what Rapines and Murthers, i
have been introduced into the World, under the pretended Authority of Jesus
Christ, and supporting and propagating Christianity ? What is the best part of
our Ecclefiastical History better than an History of the Pride and Ambinon,

the Avarice and Tyranny, the Treachery and Cruelty of some, and ofPthe
