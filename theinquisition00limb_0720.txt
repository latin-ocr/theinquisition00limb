ef· this kind the cunning Industry of the Popes hath wholly taken away, who-1»
have provided, how both the Inquifitors and Counsellors may more securely
avoid Irregularity. For Paul IV. confi-dering‚ at Rome, April 29, An. 1557.
in the Congregations held before him on the Cause of Heresy, that the
greatest Part of those imployed in this Affair, were Clergymen secular and
{Deoulan being iu Orders‚ in the Priesthood‚ and the Episcopal‚ Archiepisco-
pai or other higher Dignity‚ and even some Cardinals‚ and that it ostentimes
happened, that, according to the Nature of the Cases and Crimes before
them, they gave Sentence against the Criminals, whereby was occasioned the
Loss osa Limb, or the Effuslon of Blood‚ and sometimes even natural
Decitl132md beingtherefore willing to consult their Safety, and the Ease ol·
their Minu and Conscience, determined and decrced, that all the aforesaid who 2
should affist him in judging not only, in Causes of Heresy, but also in every -<
other criminalCause, which should or might be managed before him, might
give Sentence against criminals, by which they should be condemned to the
Qestions or Torture‚ or to any other condign Punishment, even to the Loss
of a Member, and to natural Death inclufively, without incurring any Cen-
sure or irregularity. Pius V. afterwards confirmed the same Decree, and ex—
tended it to all the Inquifitors, their Vicars, Commissaries, and CounseHors„
as Umbertus L'occztus witneffes in his Book de opere Judz'cialz' Inquistt-orum, towards
the End, tit. de decretis. So that as these Decrees now stand in Force, this
Frotestation doth not seem necessary, that the Inquifitors hereby may avoid
irregularity, when Criminals for Heresy are astually delivered over, or left...
to thesecular Court. However‚ they will not suffer it to be omitted, bo-v
cause ’tis supported by common Law, and the general Custom of the Eccle-
siastical Court·‚ nor are several Remedies, which may be had more securelyu,
‘to obtain the same End, to be reiested. ’

Nor can the fecular Judges‚ after Criminals for Heresy, relapsed or impe-
nitent‚ are delivered over, or left to thern to be put to Death‚ re-examine the
Process and Came, and corre& or alter it if needful‚ or pronounce the Sem.
tence void,

However, Simancas relates from other Authors certain Instances ofPersons,
who were unjustly condemned by the Inquifitors for Heresy, and whose Sen=
'tentes were not executed by the secular Judges. He cites Alcimus, as afferting‚
‘¹ Thatthe Lay Judge is not bound immediately to condemn a Criminal left
“ to him by thelnquifitors‚ if he was not really defiled with the Crime of.-
“ Heresy, altho' the Ecclefiastical Judge might have pronounced it so··‚ and
“ thus he adds, it was said, that the Lay Judge was not bound to execute the
‘⁸ Sentence of the inquisitor, by which he pronounced a certain *Noman an
“ Heretick‚ who in Reality had only made some Love-Potions, and against
“ whom there were besides Prools of certain, Witchcraft. John Igneus also
“ relates‚ that the same twice happened at Milan, where two Woumn, con-

‘¹ unpunished, it being found that they ever thought right concerning the
ξ* Faith. He also adds, that a certain Woman at Rozten being* condemned to
