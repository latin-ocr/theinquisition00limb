’ cupiscence‚ contrary to the Dietates of Conscience, than from some Error

Polygamists are suspected of Heresy. In Spain they are only lightly§.11.·
suspe6led, and therefore, according to the general Custom of Spain, they must
abjure only as lightly suspefted. But in the supream Tribunal of the Roman
Inquifition, they are vehemently suspeeted, and must abjure as such,

Yea, such who marry a second Wife, being ignorant that the first is dead, ⁷⁷· 59„
but yet bring Witnesses to prove that they had no Wife, although their
a-&ual Polygamy is not certain, yet they must abjure as vehemently suspected,
and be condemned to the Gallies. Carena gives us an Instance of a certain
Person of Bologna, who had married his first Wife there, and afterwards,
having examined VVitnefl'es, to prove he never had a Wife, married a se-
cond at Naples, being ignorant whether the first was dead. This Man was
brought before the Pope by the sacred Congregation, Offiob. 19. 1620. and
being first put to the Torture concerning his Intention‚ he was forced to ab·
iure as vehemently suspested, and condemned to the Gallies for five Years.
Because, though his aetual Polygamy was not certainly proved, yet, as to

himself, he had consummated the Crime.
But is any one, during the Life of his first Wife, betroths another, he is

ἶ onlylightly suspmsted, and must therefore only abjure as such. And they
’ give this Reason of the Difference3 because, in this Case, there is no astua}

 

Abuse os the Sacrament, but only an evil Dispofition of Mind to abuse it.

After Abjuration these Polygamists are enjoined various salutary Penances by §- 13·
the Inquifitors, such as Fastings, Prayers, and thelike, after which, he wh0”·⁶¹·
hath married two Wives, is condemned to the Gallies for five Years 3 and if
he hath produced false Witneffes to prove the Death of his former Wife, for

, seven Years and more, at the Pleasure of the Inquifitors, and is commanded

to return to his first Wife. If they are of the ordinary sort of People they
are generally beat, and half their Effeds confiscated. And in some Pla-
ces they have an infamous sort of a Mitte put on their Heads, and are after-
wards beaten. In Spain they are condemned to the Gallies sor ten vYears. lf
any one hath married thrice or more, he is more grievoussy punished, and
condemned for a longer while to the Gallies. Thus at Rome, May 18. An.
1597. four Polygamists were condemned to the Gallies in the Church of St.
Mary supra Minervam, by the supream Tribunal of the Roman Inquifition,
two of thern for seven YearS, who had married three Wives, and the other
two sor five Years, who had married two.
