The His-rom( ofthe INQUISITION. 87

Death the Inquifition remained in Force in that Kingdom·‚ but gradually
sunl< of it sels, upon the entire Extinetion of the Valdensbs.

[About this Time also, the Inquisition was introduced into Burgzmdy. For Des uix,
about the Year 1223. the Friars Predicants, of the Order ofDofszmick, werep. 129,&c.
received in Besancon .· For whereas some of the Valdenses had retired into the
Country of Burgundy, John Earl of Burgundy, at the Instigation 'of the Domi„
micans, obtained a Bull from Pope Imzocent IV. beginning, Zelo magno zelantes,
dated An. 1247. 12 Cal. Sep. by which the Inquisition was ereeted in the Ter.²
ritories of Besancon. The same Pope had, in the preceding Year‚ by a Eum
dated 12 Cal. Dec. beginning, Ille humani generis, &o admonii'hed the Prior
and Convent of the Friars Predicants at Bzscmcon, that they should appoint In-=
quifitors in that Country; and after an Exhortation to the whole Order,
ihould make Inquifition against Hereticks. But this Tribunal by degrees came
also to nothing·² because, when the Valdenfts were extinguilhed, there were
no others for the Inquisition to proceed against. But in these last Ages it was

restored again]

HUS far the Pope had laboured hard in promoting the Affair of the
Inquifition. But as there were perpetual Qarrels between the Popes
and the Emperor, the Pope’s Success was not answerable to his WMhes, as
being more intent upon promoting War‚ than enquiring¹ into, and judging of
HerefieS. But after'the Death of the Emperor Frederick, the Affairs of Ger-
many being in great Disorder, and Italy without any Prince 3 Pope Innocent IV.
seeing all Things become subje& to his Power, in the Milaneze and other Parts
of Italy, determ'ined to extirpate all Herefies‚ which had greatly encreased in
the preceding, War: And because the Dominican and Franciscan Friars had

ever: He therefore ereeted a Tribunal, ’solely for the Bufiniiss of the Faith 3,
and gave to the Inquifitors perpetual Power to administer Judgment in his
Name in this Cause„ Δ
His first and principal Care was to purge Italy fromHeresy, which was near-
est to himself, and mostly subject to his Power 3 and therefore he erested se-
veral Tribunals of the Inquisition therein. In the Year 1251. he created lsi-via-
