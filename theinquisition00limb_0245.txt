Paulus Servita tells us, in his History of the Venetian Inquifition, that these
Laws were made in the Year of our Lord 1244. Bzovius and Raynald refer
them to the Year 1225. But whatever was the Year of their Publication, 'tis
certain that the Inquifition was greatly, promoted by them ·, and that they
were approved and confirmed, by some of the Popes Bulls, in which they
were inserted.

N the Year of our Lord 1231. in the Month of February, some of theRaynaid..
Patarenes were discovered in the City of Rome .· Some of> them who were a· 1231³>

impenitent were burn’d alive3 others of thern were sent to the Church of ᾗ· ¹3·

blasphemous Tongues to be cut out, if the keeping them alive would prove a Terror

to other53 which-Raynald affirms to be a severe, but most just Edier.

This very Year Pope Gregory IX. gave a famous Instance of his Tyranny
and Injustice. Ezelinm, Lord of Padua, and Vaffal of the Emperor Frede-
rick, constantly adhered to his Master, and faithfully took the Emperors
Part against the Faffion of the Pope. On this the Pope endeavoured to ren-
der him infamous by the Charge of·Heresy ; that under this specious Pre-
tence he might expe] him his Dominions: But as he failed in this, he stirred
up his Children against him this very Year, that being delivered by them
into his Power, he might punish him as he pleased. In order to this, he sent §- 20, ἕως,
Letters to Ezeline‚ beseechingn him to takes better Measures, and admoniihed
him to renounce his Errors. A Copy ofthese Letters he sent to his two Son&
young Ezeline and Altericlss who pretended to abhor their Father's Wickedneis,
