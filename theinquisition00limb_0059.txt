>inquire out the Truth. Athanafius‚ however, appealed to Constanline, and

gave him such a Representation of the Conncil's Transac] ions as greatly offend-

ed him. But when Eusebius and otherslaid the whole Matter before him, the
Emperor entirely altered his Sentiments, confirmed his Deposition‚ and ba-
-nistied him into France.

lndeed Athanastus, notwithstanding his sad Complaints under Persecution,

and his expressy calling it a diabolica] Invention, yet seems to be against it only Ad imp.
when he and his own -Party were persecuted, but not against persecuting theCOssst·
Enemies of Orthodoxy. In his Letter to EpiHetus, Bishop ofCorinth, he saith, sApol.
wonder that your Piety hath born thefi² Things (viz. the Herefies he had before· p. ⁷¹⁶¹
mentioned) and that you did not immediately put those Hereticks under Rcssrainss and V⁰¹·8 ⁶
propos& the trae Faith to them3 that if they would not forbear to contradi& theyp'5 4⁴
might be declared Hereticks ; for ’tis not to be endurecl that these ‘Things should be either

said or heard amongfft Christiam. And in another Place he says, that they ought to Orat. t.

Emperor, upon due information, would put a Stop to their WickednesS, and P· 304·
that they would not belong liv'd. And to mention no more, I therefore exhort Vol. Ι»
you, says he, lec no one be deceivcd, but as though the Jewish Impiecy was prevailingp· 29¹·
over the Faith cf Christ, be γε all zealous in the Lorii. And let every one holdf:i the

Faith he hail> receivedfrom the Famem, which alsb the Fathers met together a! >J icc

τίσω therein. 'Tis needless to produce more Instances ofthis kind ·, w‘hosoever P. 292.
gives himself the Trouble of looking over any ofthe Writings of this Father,

will find in them the most furious Investives against the Arimis, and that he
studioussy endeavours to represent them in such CoIours, as might render thern

the Abhorrence of Mankind, and excite the World to their utter Extirpa-

tion.

Ι write not these Things out of any Aversion to the Memory, or peculiar

Principles ofAlhanafius 3 whether I agree with him, or differ from him in Opi-

nion, Ι think my self equally obliged to give impartially the true Account of

him. And as this which I have given of him is drawn partly from History,

and partly from his own VVritings, I think Ι cannot be justl‘y charged with
misrepresenting him. To speak plainly, 1 think that Athanasius was a Man of

an haughty and inflexible Temper, and more concerned for Victory and Power

than for Truth, Religion or Peace. The Word Consubstantial that was inserted

into the Nicene Creed, and the Anathema denounced against all who would 0ΐὸοΖΔ l·2·›
could not believe in it, furnished Matter for endless Debates. Those who were ⁰· ¹8·
against it censured as Blasphemers those who used it 3 and as denying the pro-

per Subsistence of the Son, and as falling into the Sabellian Heresy. The
Consubstantialists on the other side reproached their Adversaries as Heathens,

and with bringing in the Polytheism of the Gentzles. And though they equal-

ly denied the Consequences which their respective Erinciples were charged with,

yet as the Orthodox would not part with the Word Consubstczntial‚ and the Ari-

ans could not agree to the Use of it, they continued their unchristian Re·-

proaches and Accusations of eac-h other.f Athanastus would yield to no Tem}
