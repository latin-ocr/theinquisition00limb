and so easily finks down the thin Cloth to the Bottom of his Throat‚ so that
there is no Poffibility of breathing, his Mouth being stopped with Water,
and his Nostrels with the eloth, so that the poor Wretch isin the same Ago-
ny, as Persons ready to die, ancl breathing out their last. WVhen this Cloth
is drawn out ofhis Throat‚ as it often is, that he may answer to the QG-
stionS, it is all wet with Water and Blood, and is like pulling his Bowels thro'
his Mouth. The1e is also another Kind ofTorture peculiar to this Tribunal,
which they call the Fire. They order a large Iron Chafin-diih full oflighted
Char-coal, to be brought in, and held close to the Soles of the tortured Per-
son’s Feet, greased over with Lard, so that the Heat of the Fire may more
quickly pierce thro’¹ them.

This is Inquifition by Torture‚ when there is only half full Proof of theirs
Crime. However, at other Times Torments are sometimes inflieted upon
Persons condemned to Death, as a Punilhment preceding that of Death. Of
this we have a remarkable Instance in Wz'lliam Lithgow, an Etzglzsshman, who,
as he tells usin his Travels, was taken up as a Spy in Mallagom‚ a City of
Spain, and was exposed to the most cruel Torments upon the Wooden Herse,
But when nothing* could be extorted from him, he was delivered to the In-
quifition as an Heretick, because his Journal abounded with Blasphemies
against the Pope and the Virgin Mary. When he confessed himself a Pro-
testant before the Inquifitor, he was admonished to convert himself to the Ro-

* manChurch, and was allowed eight Days to deliberate on it. In the mean*
while the Inquifitor and Jesuites carne to him often, sometimes wheedling
him, sometimes threatning and reproaching him, and sometimes arguing with
him. Atlength they endeavour'd to overcome his Constancy by kind Assu—
rances and Promises. But all in vain. And therefore as he was immov.1bly
fixed, he was condemned in the Reginning of Lem, to suffer the Night fol-
lowing eleven most cruel Torments, and after Easter to be carried privately
to Granada, there to be burnt at Midnight, and his Ashes to be scattered
into the Air: When Night came on his Fetters were taken off, then he was
stripped naked, put upon his Knees, and his Hands lift up by Force·‚ after
which opening his Mouth with Iron Instruments, they filled his Belly with
Water till it carne out of his J‘aw's. Then they tied a Rope hard about his
Neck, and in this Condition rolled him seven times the whole Length os the
Room, till he was almost quite strangled. After this they tied a small Cord
about both his great Toes, and hung him up thereby with his Head towards
the Ground, and then cut the Rope about his Neck, letting him remain in
this Condition‚ till all the Water discharged it self out of his Mouth; so that
he was laid on the Ground as just dead, and had his Irons put on him again,
But beyond all Expefitatiom and by a very singular Accident‚ he was deliver’d
out of Jayl, escaped Death‚ and fortunately sail’d home to Englana', But
this Method of Torturing doth not belong to this Place, where we are treat-
