kind of penitential Garment was in Use. For upon such Criminals as were
not convicit, but only vehemently suspedted of Heresy‚ they used to put a
half penitential Garment, covering the Breast only, which was marked only
with one Line, of a red Colour‚ and not with two cross oneS, as the whole
Sackcloth used to be marked with, that it might be hereby stiewn‚ that he
was not truly and formally an Heretick, but vehementi y suspected ofHeresy.]¹
This Cloak the Italians call Abinna, the Spaniards, Sanc benite, as tho’ it was
Sacco benito, i. e. the bleffed Sackcloth, because it is fit for Penance, by which
we are bleffed and saved. But Simancas says, 'tis the Garment of St. BenediH.
The wearing it is commanded, 4 Instrubl‘. c. 9. They pretend that the Foun-
dation of this Habit is to be found in the sacred Writings, because those who
suffered formerly for their Impiedes, were, besides other Penances, some·
times cloathed with Sackcloth, in order to implore the divine Mercy, and to
render God propitious whom they had offended, as they shew in the Example
ofAchab, 1 Kings xxi.» 27.

But Ludovz'cus a Paramo carries its original higher‚ viz. that as G0d1.1. t. 2.
eloath’d our first Parents with Garments of Skins, in Token of Confufiorrc- 425·
and perpetualShame, so the Inquisitors‚ at this Day, in Imitation of God,
eloath such as are convieted of Heresy‚ with these blessed Sackcloths‚ with
oblique Croffes on them, tothe proper Ignominy and Confufion of those who
wear thems And he gives this Reason why these ignominious Garments are
called bleffed Sackcloths. Because formerly Sinners were cloathed with bleffed
Sackcloths, in Token of publick Penmxce, and was taken upon a voluntary
Vow by the Penitents themselves. But this Custom, in Process of Time,¹
came into Disuse3 and because antiently these Sackcloths· were bleffed in
the Primitive Church, therefore they were called blffd Sackcloths. And there-
fore the Inquifition, in Detestation of the Crime of Heresy‚ hath renewed
the Custom of publick, Penance and bleffed Sackcloth. He gives also a
very ridiculous Reason, why the Croffes, which were formerly strait, are now
made oblique, upon the penitential Garments. Because the Cross is the external
Sign, by which all the Worshippers of Christprofess the Catholick Fajth. Since there-
fore they who offend against the Catholick Faith, deviate from the Reffltude of the
Faith, the Inqu'zfitors are used to cloath Penitents with these transverse Marks, in
Token of such Deviazz'on, that it may appear to all by the Pigure of the oblique Craſs,
what is the inward Sta-te of'him that wears it, what he harh been, and how he bach
wandered from the Restitude of the Faith and of the Christian Religion.

These Croffes are put on those, who have believed Heresres, and sometimes
on those who have been Dogmatisers, but who immediately, upon their being
found out and informed against beforethe Bishops and Inquifitors, depart from·
their Errors, and consent to abjure them.. Such are more gently dealt with,
and ’tis eafier to have a Dispensation as to-their Penance. Por either they are
ω wear their Croffes only for a Time, or if they are injoined them ior
their whole Life, ‘after they have worn them for some Years, in another Ser--
mon or A& of Faith‚ they leave them off again, or if they are in an ill¹
