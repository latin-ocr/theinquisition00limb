The Hisromc of the INQmsm-mN. 247

As these Keepers have it in their Power greatly to injure or serve their Pri-
soners they must promise by an Oath‚ before the Biihop and Inquifitors,
that tliey will exercise a faithful Care and Concern in keeping them, and that
neither of them will speak to any of them but in Presence of the other, and
that they will not defraud them of their Provision‚ nor of those Things
which are brought to them. Their Servants also are obliged to take this

th.

Oibut notwithstanding this LaW, a great Part of the Provision appointed for
the Prisoners is with-held from them by their covetous Keepers; and ifthey
are accused for this to the Inquifitors‚ they are much more gently puniffied, than
if they had used any Mercy towards them. Reginald Gonsalve relateS, that in
his Time, Gaspar Bennavidius was Keeper ofa Jayl. “ He was a Man os mon-13,- 1*1r‚·
“ strous Covetousness and Cruelty, who defrauded his miserable Prisoners of a <5³⁶-
‘⁶ great Part ostheir Provismn, which were ill dressed, and scarce the tenth
“ Part of what was allowed them, and sold it secretly‚ for no great Price, at
‘⁶ the Triancz. Befides, he wholly kept from them the little Money allowed
‘⁶ them to pay for the washing of their Linen, thus suffering them to abide
“ many Days‘ together in a nasty Conditiom deceiving. the Inquifitor and
“ Treasurer‚ who put that Money to the Keepers Account‚ as though it had
“ been expended every Week for the Use ofthe Prisoners, for whom it is ap-
‘ pointed. Neither was it very difficult to deceive them, because they took
“ but little Pains to enquire out the Truth. If any one of the Prisoners
“ complained, muttered, or opened his Mouth upon account of this intole-
“ rable Usage‚ the cruel VVretch‚ who had divested himself ofail Humansty,
“ had a Remedy at hand. He brought the Prisoner immediately out of his
“ Apartment‚ and put him down into a Place they call Mazmorm, a deep
“ Cistern that had no &Vater in it. There he left him sor several Days toge—
“ ther, without any Thing to lie on, not so much as Straw. His Provision
‘³ there was so very rotten, that it was more proper to destroy his Health
“ by Sickness, than to preserve it, or support him in Life. All this he did
“ without ever consulting the Inquisitors, and yet fraudulently and villanously
“ pretended their Command to his Prisoner. If any one besought him to
“ complain to the Inquisitors sor so injurious a Tre-„irment, for they could
⁴‘ not do it by any other Person, and to desire an Audience, the cunning
“ &Vretch knowing that the whole Blame must lie upon himself, pretenda
“ ed that he had asked, but could not obtain it. By such forged Answers,
“ he kept the miserable Prisoner in that deep Pit twelve or fifteen Days‚
“ more or less, till he had fully gratified his Anger and Cruelty. After this
“ he brought him out, and threw him into his former Jayh persuading him·
“ that this Favour was owing to his Humanity and Care, having· made [hren
“ ceffion sor him with their Lordships. In short, his Thefts and lnjuries with
“ which he plagued his Prisoroers, who were otherwise miserable enough,
“ were so numerous, that some Persons of Interest with the Inquisitors qt
‘¹ lenoth accused him before them. Upon this he was imprisoned himiclt3
