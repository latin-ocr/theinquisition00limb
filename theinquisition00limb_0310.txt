142 The HISTORY of the INQuistrroN.

strom, notwithstanding the Pope’s Prohibition, continually proceed in the Ad-
ministration of their Office‚ and Oppreffion ofthe Miserable.

The same Year, March 1 1. they presented another humbleSupplication to
the Pope, in which they acquaint him, that after their having presented their
former Petition, they had received Letters from Lisbon, by which they are
informed how many Things were transacted at Court‚ in Favour ofthe Inqui-
sltors, and such, which in the present State of Things, were greatly contrary
to their Expectations. They also give a large Account ofwhat had happen'd
upon Account of the Revolution in the Kingdom ·, that the Papers and Wri-
tingq, which they had delivered to the Pope, as also the VVritings of the
Courts and Halls, ,were in the Poffeffion of the Portugueze Inquifitors‚ who
publickly talk’d of them, and permitted every one to read them, by which
they prejudiced others against them : And therefore beseech the Pope, that
he would regard them, and put an End to their Miser-ies.

finally, in the lame Year, August 6. they presented a third Petition‚ in
which they tell him, that they had humbly petitioned the Apostolick Nuncio
at Lisbon, who -had referred them to the Archbishop of that See: That in
Obedience to his Rescript‚ they went to the Archbishop. That he had a
Conference with the Inquifitor Genera13 and that after a long Consultation
nothing was concluded on. That the Archbishop indeed declared, he knew of
a Remedy, and could point it outs but that he would not contend with the
Inquisitor about it, till he was suspended and deposed from his Office by him,
who had the legal Authority to suspend and depose him. And that therefore,
fince they could not find Relief from his Nuncio‚ they apply themselves to
the Pope, and mofl: earnestly beseech him that he would expedite their
Affair.

From these Accounts 'tis plain that these Deputies had some Hopes given
them of Favour ς but that they were deluded with empty Words and flatter-
ing Promises : For they still groan as before, under the crue] Yoke of the In-
quisition, without any Mitigation of their Punishmentss and to this Day are
liable to all the Penalties ordain'd against HeretickS.
