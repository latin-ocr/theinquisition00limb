⁵ These Keepers are answerable for the smallest Fault, for they are to use
the same Care in the Custody of their Prisoners, as Fathers ought to do in go·-
verning their Families 3 so that ifthey suffer ony one to escape from Jayl, they
are to be punished according to the Nature of their Offence. ’Tis therefore
their Busmess frequently to vislt and search the Cells of their Prisoners, to pre-
vent any Thing from being clandestinely carried in, by which they may destroy
carena, themselves, dig through the Walls‚ and so escape. Their Care of the Wo-
Ρ. 1. t. 15.men is to be peculiarly strist, fince the Sex is naturally frail, and more sub-
n. Η* je& than Men to yield to Paffion and Despair, and so are more likely to ‘seek
an Occasion of destroying themselves. They must, above all other Things,
take Care that they do not behave themselves indecently towards their Wo-
men Prisoners. Thus the Congrcgation of Cardinals Inquisitors General,
condemned a Jayl Keeper to the Gallies for seven Years, and to perpetual
Banishment from the Place where he committed his Offence, for having car-
nal Knowledge of a Woman that was Prisoner in the Holy Office 3 as appears
from the Letters of Cardinal Arigonius, Jcm. 13, 1610. directed to the Inqui-
fitor of Cremona.

If the Inquifitor thinks it necessary to prevent the Escape of any Prisoners,
he may lay them in Irons. If the Poverty of the Inquifitors is so great, or their
jayls so defective, as that they are not fit to hold in safe Custody, either'for
the Thinness of the Walls‚ or for want of Iron Bars to the Windows, or suf*
ficient Bolts for the Doors, if the Magistrate be required by the Inquifitor, ho
must take Care of the safe Custody of the Prisoners, according to the Consti-
tution of Alexander IV. beginning, Ad exstirpanda.
