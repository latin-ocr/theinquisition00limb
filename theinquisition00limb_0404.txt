one of the supream Inquisitors, in all Causes in which Lay Persons had a¹

⁶⁰'⁷²· ¹07· ticulczrly dcfigned to keep Criminals in szstody, and not to punish, them, yet we· do not
disapprove that convz'b? Persbns should be delivered over to Prison to do Penance either
for ever, orfor a Time, as you shall judge most}v convenient, their Crimes, Persem-3
and other Circmnstances, being carefully considered. Simancas gives this Reason
embol. In· for iti: For stnce the sacred Canons, through the Ecclefiastz'cal Lenity‚ cannot instifi-
stimmo-the Punifhmentof Denth, the Consequence is, that lest Crimes fhoztc'd go unpunished‚

which is indeed very grievous, and equal to Denth. Heretofore the Bishop and In-
quisitor might have their separate Jayls, to hold Persons in Custody, but not·
to punish thern ·‚ for as they cannot condemn any one to Imprisonrnent without
the Consent of both, 'tiS therefore required that the Jayl for Punishment shall‘
be common to both. But now they have not usually separate Prisons3 the
same that belongs to the Inquisitor, in which Criminals are kept in Custody5-
being common to the Bishop. “

any Person can be thrown into Jayl. Secondly, what Method must be ob->
served in· keeping and placing the Prisoners.

Part 2. As to the first, Royas gives this large Account cs it. In all causes, as well·
„affert- 1- civil as criminal, Criminals must not be apprehended, without a summary In-
quifition against them concerning their Crime first had. This is particularly—
to be observed in the Crime of Heresy. For though in other Crimes no one
suffers much in2his Reputation merely for his being thrown into Prison‚ yet [Q
be taken up for, the Crime of Heresy is greatly infamous, which must there-
fore be proceeded in with great Caution. For fince the Reason of proceedings

inthe Crime of Heresy is much more important than in other Offence3‚ there
