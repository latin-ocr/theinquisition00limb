the Words were very impmper, and implied a great deal more than was pre-
tended to be meant by thern ·, and especially because an Anathema was added
upon all who should presume not to believe in them and use them. Eusebius
of Caesarea gives a very extraordinary Reason for his subscribing this Anather
ma, viz. because it forbids the Use of zmscriptural Words, the introducingwhich he
affigns ας the Occaston'of all the Differences and Disturbances which had trouhlfd the
Charch. But had he been-confistent with himself, he ought never to have sub·
scribed this Creed, for the very Reason he alled es why he did it 3 because the
Anatlrema forbids only the unscriptural Words 0 Arius, such as, He was made
out of umbi-‘ng ·‚ ther: ‘ceras a ‘T ime when he was not, and the likes but allowed and
made sacred the unscriptural Expressions of the Orthodox‚ viz. Of the Father’s
Substausce, and C074subsia³1tial, ancl cut off from Christian Communion those
who would not agree to them, though they were highly exceptionable to the
Arian Party, and. afterwards proved the Occafions of many cruel Persecutions
and Evils.

In this puhlick Manner did the Bishops affert a Dominion over the Faith
und Consciences of others, and affume a power, not only to dictate to them
what they should believe, but even to anathematize, and expel from the Chri-
stian Church, all who refused to submittovtheir Decifions, and own their Au·
[horit-J. Fer atter they had carried their Creed‚ they proceeded to excom-
municate Arius and his Followers‚ and banished Arius from Alexandria. They
also condemned his Explication of his own Doctrine, and a certain Book, cal-
led fabalia, which he had written concerning it. After this they sent Letters to
Alexatzdriffi and to the Brethren in Egypt, Lybia, and Pentapolis, to acquaint
thern wizh their Decrees‚ and to inform them, that the Holy Synod had‘con-
demned the Opinions of Arius, ancl were so zealous in.this Affiir, th‘at they
had not patience so muth as to hear his ungodly Dot‘trine and blasphemousr
words, and that they had fully determined the Time for the Celebration of
Ezjhr. Finally‚ they exhort them to rejoice for the good Deeds they had

. done, and sor that they had cut off all manner of Heresy, and to pray that

their right Tranffiftions might be established by Almighty God and our [jord
jesus Chr‘st. When these Things were over, Constantine splendidly treated the
Bilhops, filled their Pockets, and sent them honourably horne3 advifing them
at parting to maintain Peace amongst themselves, and that none of them should
envy another who might excel the rest in Wisdom and Eloquence, and that
such should not carry themselves haughtily towards their Inferioris, but concle-
scend to, and bear with their Weakness. A plain Demonstration that he saw
into their Tempers, and was no Stranger to the Pride and Haughtiness that in·
fluenced some, and the Envy and Hatred that actuated others. After he had
thus dismissed them he sent several Letters, recommending and enjoyning an
universal Conformity to the Councils Decrees both in Ceremony and Dostrine,
