PREFACE to the ΚΕΑΒΕΗ.

‚Quotations in that ‘Treatrfig what I have transcribed from thenceJ
ought, in Justice, to have the selme Authority. with the Papists, as
though [had quoted it from the very Anthou, , whose Words are made
esse of by that most learned Prelme.

The Reader may, perhaps, wonder at one Thing, that I have al-
ways called those Hereticks that have been proceeded agaiogsl by the
Inquisition .· Dat, as· I was relating the Popes Dum, and the De·-
crees of Popish Cozmcils, I could not help ofing the same Words I
found in them. By cm Heretick‚ therefore, I understand one condemned
sor Heres} by the Church of Rome. I could not rehearse their De-
crees hut in their own Wrds, and was therefore forced always to ufi’
them& unless I would have interrupted the course of the Hostoer by
repeated and innumerahle Alterations‚ and thereby rendered it less
pleafing and acceptable. Let it therefore fzffice, once for all, to say,
thot, by the Word Heretick, when I ever speak of the Inqmsttion against
Heretick's, , Ido not mean one who is truly cm Heretick‚ hut accounted
cm Henetick by the Chetroh of Rome, taking the Word in the Popish
Sense of it. In the mecm while, thofi,² who are-Hereticks in their
Accozmt, are not so. in mine3 and Ι fincerely believe, that those which:
the Church of Rome hath condemned for Heresy, have died, cmd
gloricusty endured the Pumfhment of Fire for the Testimmy of Jesus
Chrzst, and the mefifftctiviog a good Conscience. These few {things I
thought proper to advtse my kind Reader os, cmd hope he willpass a.
favourable Jztdgment. Sep. 13. An. cmmcxcn.
