ordering the Houses where they met to be confiscated, and commanding that
suchwho went to other Places to teach their Opinions, or perform their reli-
gious worship, should be forced to return to the Places where they dwelt, con-
demning all those Officers and Magistrates of Cities who should not prevent such
Affemblies. A little while after the Conclufion ofthis Council, finding that many
Disorders were still occasioned through the Oppofition ofthe several Parties to one Soz. 1. 7.
another, he convened the principal Persons ofeach, and ordered them to deliver e. ιι..
into his Hand a written Form ostheir Belfef, which after he had received, he reti-

red by himself, and earnestly prayed to God, that he would enable him to make
Choice osthe Truth. And when after this he had perused the several Papers
delivered to him, he tore them all in piet-es, except that which contained the
Doctrine of the indivifible Trinity‚ to which he intirely adhered. After this

he published a Law, by which he forbid Hereticks to worihip or preach, or to
ordainBishops or others, commanding some to be banished, others to be render-

ed infamous‚ and to be deprived of the common Privileges ofCitizens‚ with
other grievous Penalties os the like nature. Sozomen, however, tells-us, that

he did not put these Laws in execution, because his Intention was not to punish

his Subjects, but to terrify them into the same Opinions of God with himself,
praifing at the same time those who voluntarily embraced them. Socratesl· 5·C·20·
,also confirms the same, telling us, that he only banished Eunomz‘us from Con—
stantinople for holding private Assemblies, and reading his Books to them, and
thereby corrupting many with his DoCtriue. But that as to others he gave
them no Disturbance, nor forced them to communicate with him, but allowed
them all their seyeral Meetings, and to enjoy their own Opinions as to the
Christian Faith. Some he permitted to build Churches without the Cities,

and the Novatians to retain their Churches within, because they held the same
Doctrines with himself.

ty, Nefiarz'us Bishop of Constantinople died, and John, called for his Eloquence
Chrysostom, was ordained in his room t He was a Person ofa very rigid and se-
ver-e Temper, an ,Enemy to Hereticks, and against allowing them any Tole-
ration. Gaina, one of the principa} Officers of Arcadius, and who was a Chri-
stian of the Arian Perswasion, defired ofthe Emperor one Church for himself
and those of his Opinion, within the City. Chrysostom being informed ofit, im—
mediately went to the Palace‚ taking with him all the Bishops he could find at
Constantinople, and in the Presence of the Emperor bitterly inveigh‘d against
Gaina, who was himself at the Audience, and reproached him for his former
Poverty, as also with Insolence and Ingratitude. Then lie produced the Law
that was made by Theodofius‚ by which Hereticks were forbidden to hold As-

him to keep in force all the Laws against Hereticks 3 adding, that 'twas better
voluntarily to quit the Empire, than to be guilty of the Impiety of betraying
