Irene and Constantine approved and subscribed these Decrees, and the Con-
sequence was, That Idols and Images were ere&ed in all the Churches ς and
those who were against thern, treated with great Severity. This Council was
held under the Popedom os Hadrian Ι. and th‘us, by the Intrigues of the Popes
of Rome, Iniquity was established by a Law, and the Worlhip of Idols au-
thorized and established in the Christian Church, though contrary to all the
Principles of natural Religion, and the Nature and Defign of the Christian
Revelation.

In vit. 'Tis true, that this Decifion os the Council did not put an entire End to the

H²drian1·C0nt1-0ver1‘y. Platina tells us, That Constantine himself not long after annul·
led their Decrees, and removed his Mother from all Share in the Government.
The Synod also of Francfort, held about fix Years after, decreed that thetWor-
ship and Adoration of Images was impious·, condemned the Synod of Nice,
which had established it, and ordered that it should not be called either the Se<-
venth, or an universal Council. But as the Roman Pontiffs had engrossed
almost all Power into their own Hands, all Oppofition to Image Worlhip
became ineffectua13 especially as they supported their Decrees by the Civil
Power, and caused great Cruelties to be exercised towards all those who should
dare dispute or contradi& them.

F or many Years the World groaned under this antichristian Yoke3 nor
were any Methods of Fraud, Imposture and Barbarity left unpra&ised to sup-
port and perpetuare it. As the Clergy rid Lords of the Universe, they grew
wauton and insolent in their Power 3 and as they drained the Nations os their
Wealth to support their own Grandure and Luxury, they degenerated into
the worst and vilest set of Men that ever burdened the Earth. They were
ssiainefully ignorant, and scandaloussy vicious 3 well versed in the most exqui-
fite Arts of Torture and Cruelty, and absolutely divested of all Rowels of
Mercy and Compaffion towards those, who even in the smallest Matters dif-
fered from the Diaates of their Superstition and Impiety. The infamous Pra-
erices of that accursed Tribunal, the Inquifition, the Wars against Hereticks
in the Earldom of Tholouse, the Maffacres of Paris and Ireland, the many Sa-
crifices they have made in Great-Britain, the Fires they have kindled‚ and
the Flames they have lighted up in all Nations, where their Power harh been
acknowledged‚ witness against them, and demonstrate thern to be very Mon·
sters of Mankind. So that one would really wonder, that the whole World
bath not entered into a Combination, and risen in Arms against so execrable
a Set of Men, and extirpated them as savage Beasts, from the Face of the
whole Earth3 who, out os a Pretence of Religion, have defiled it with the
Blood os innumerable Saints and Martyrs, and made use os the Name of the
most holy Jesus‚ to countenance and sanffify the most abominable Im-

reties.

P But it pleased God, in his good Providence, to take the R-emedy and
Cure of these Evils, into his own Hands 3 and aster several fruitless Attemptt
by Men, to bring about, at last, a Reformation os Religion, by his own Wis-
dom and Power. The History of this great Event hath been very particularae
