The Inrnonuo‘rroN.

‘Prejud'ree{'‚ entered into the Measures of Persecution under pretence of
·vindicating the Christian Religion, yet as they have no Support and Foun-
dation in the Gospel ofChrist, the Gospel ought not to be reproacned for
this, 01· any other Faults of those who profess to believe it. Let Persecution
be represented asa most detestable and impious Pratiice, and let Persecutors
of every Denomination and Degree bear all the Reproac'nes they deserte,
and be esteemed, as they ought to be, the Disturbers‚ Plagues and Curses
of Mankind‚ and the Church of God; but let not the Religion of Jesus
Christ suffer for their Crimes, nor strare any Part of that Scandal, which is
due only to those who have dishonoured their CharaCter and Profeffion, and
abused the most beneficent and kind Institution that ever appeared in the
5KV011d·
It is in order to expose this ffiameful Prac'tice‚ and render it the Abhor-
rence of all Mankind, thatI have drawn up the foregoing Sheets, and, 1
presume‚ that no one who hath not put off Humanity it self can read them,
-without becoming Sentiments of Indignation. The true Use to be made of
that History, is, not to think diffionourably of Christ and his Religion, not
to conternn and despise his faithful Ministers, who, by Preaching and Pra-
ftice, by Reason and Argurnent, endeavour to propagate Knowledge‚ Piery,
Righteousness, Charity, and all the Virtues of private and social Life.
The Bleffing of the Almighty God be with them. The Grace of our Lord
jesus Christ succeed and prosper thern. 1 say therefore, the Use of the fore-
going History is to teach Men to adhere close to the Doarines and W'ords of
Christ and his Apostles, to argue for the Doctrines of the Gospel with Meek-
ness and Charity, to introduce no new Terms of Salvation and Chri-
stian Communion‚ not to trouble the Christian Church with metaphysical
‘Subtleties and abstruse Questions‚ that minister to Qarelling and Strife, not
to pronounce Censures‚ Judgrnents, and Anathemas‚ upon such as may dif-
fer from us in speculative Truths, not to exclude Men from the Rights
of civil Society, nor lay them under· any negative or pofitive Discouragements
sor Conscience sake, or for their different Usages and Rites in the Externals
of Christian worship 3 but to remove those which are already laid, and which
*are as much a Scandal to the Authors and Continuers of them, as they are a
Burthen to those who labour under them. These were the sole Views that
influenced me to lay before my Reader the foregoing melancholy Ac-
count3 not any Defign to refle6t on the Clergy in general, whose Office and
Charaffier Ι greatly reverence, and who, by affing according to the ori-
ginal Des-,gn of their Institution, would prove the most usefui Set of Men in
-ssevery Nation and Kingdorn, and thereby secure to themselves all the Esteem
they could reasonably defire in the present Vx'orld, and, what is infinitely
more valaable, the Approbation of their great Lord and Master in another,

FINIS.
