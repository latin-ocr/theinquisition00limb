nothing, they afterwards make use of more grievous⁴ ones, then proceed to
such as are more 611161, till at different Intervals 01 Time they have gone
thro’ all the several Kinds of Tortures. And this they don’t call a Repetiti0n‚.
but only a Continuation of the Torture ς so that if any one hatb been several
