The INTnonuertoN}

ssissmp of Constantinople, soon forced Bafilz'scus to alter his Measures, by raifing
up the Monks and Mob of the City against him 3 so that he recalled his for-
mer Letters, and ordered Nestorius and Eutyches, with all their F ollowers‚ to
be anathematized, and soon after he quitted the Empire to Zeno. Upon his
Restoration he immediately rescinded the Aots of Bastliscus, and expelled those
Bishops from their Sees which had been ordained during his Abdication. ln
the mean Time the Astatick Bishops‚ who in their Letter to Bastlz‘scus had decla-
red, that the Report of their subscribing involuntarily, and byforce‚ was a Slander
anda Lye3 yet upon this Turn ofAffairs‚ in order to excuse themselves to
Aeacius, and to ingratiate themselves with Zeno, affirm, T hat they did it not vo-
luntarily‚ but by force, swearing that they had always, ancl did now believe the Faith
of the Synod of Chalcedon. Evagrius leaves it in doubt, whether Zacharias de·
iamed them, or whether the Bishops lyed, when they affirmed that they sub-
scribed involuntarily‚ and against their Consciences. ’

Zeno observing the Disputes that had arisen through the Decrees of the last
Council, published his Henoticon, or his uniting and pacifick Εᾱὶὲῖ, in which he
confirmed the Nicene, Constantinopolitan‚ and Ephcfine CounciIS, ordained that
the Nicene Creed should be the Standard of Orthodoxy, declared that neither
himself nor the Churches have, or had, or would have any other Symbol or
Boetrine but that, condemned Nestorius and Eutyches, and their Followers 3
and ordered, that whosoever had, or did think otherwise, either now or for-
merly, whether at Chalcedon or any other Synod, ssiould be anathematized.
The Intention of the Emperor by this Edist, was plainly to reconcile the
Friends and Opposers of the Synod of Chalcedon3 for he condemned Nestorius
and Eutyches, as that Council had done, but did not anathematize those who
would not receive their Decrees, nor submit to them as os equa} Authority
with those of the three former Councils : But this Compromise was far from
having the defired effect.

During these Things several Changes happen’d in theBishoprick of Alexandria.
Timothy, Bishop of that Place being dead, one Peter Mongus was elected by the
Bishops Suffragans of that See, which so enraged Zeno, that he intended to
have put him to Death, but changed it for Banishment, and Timothy‚ Succeffor
of Proterius, was substituted in his room. Upon Umothy's Death John, a
Presbyter of that Church, obtained the Bishoprick by Symony, and in De-
fiance of an Oath he had taken to Zeno, that he would never procure himself
to be eleeted into that See. Upon this he was expelled, and Mongus restored
by the Emperor's Order. Mongus immediately consented, and subscribed to
the pacifick Εάἰξὶ, and received into Communion those who had formerly been
of a different Party. Soon after this he was accused by Calendio Bishop of An-
tioch for Adultery, and for having publickly anathematized the Synod of Chal·
cedon at Alexandria; and though this latter Charge was true, yet he solem-“ily
denied it in a Letter to Aeacius Bishop os Constantinople‚ turning with the Time,
condemning and receiving it, just as it suited his Views, and served his Interest.
But being at last accused before Felix Bishop of Rome, he was pronounced an
Heretick‚ excommunicated, and anathematized.
