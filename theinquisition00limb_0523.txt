human Nature, even of Crimes they have never thought of, and of which

they have never heard so much as the Description. And therefore 'tis not to

be wondered at, thatthe Inquifitors, within the Space of 150 Years, should

have burnt 30000 VVitches‚ as Ludoviczzs a Paramo says they have ·, adding : De orig,
‘⁶ The Inquifitors have most severely prosecuted these most outragious P‘uries, 1⁷1q- l. ὲ·
‘⁶ who have thrown off all Humanity, especially in the Kingdom ofSicily,¹· 3· ⁶· 4·
ce where, when Imy sels, a few Years past, executed the Office of Inqu'zst-p' ²9⁶⁶
‘⁶ tor, many of this kind of Apostate Witches were discovered and pu-

⁶‘ nished.''

But as by this Method of Proceeding many notorious and manifest Acts of
Injustice were commited, a certain Instruction was put into the Hands of the
Inquisltors in Italy, which Carena hath published, in which 'tis affirmed:
‘⁶ That it hath for a long time been observed in the Congregation of the
“ Universal Inquifition at Rome, that scarce any Process hath been ever
‘⁶ found to be rightly and juridically formed; that it hath been generally
“ found necessary to censure most of the Judges, and ostentimes to punish
aa them for illegal VexationS, Inquifitions, Imprisonments, as also for several
“ evil and impertinent Methods used in forming Proceffes‚ interrogating·
“ Criminals, inflicting exceffive Tortures3 insomuch that sometimes unjust
“ and unrighteous Sentences have been pronounced‚ even of Death, or de-
“ livering Persons over to the secular Arm. And it bath been found in
‘⁴ Fan, that many Judges have been too easy and ready to believe a ‘No-
“ man to be a Witch for a light Proof, or rather none at all, upon'which
“ Account they have omitted nothing, no not unlawful Methods‚ to extort
“ such a Confeffion from these &Vomem notwithstanding there have been so
‘⁶ many Improbabilities, Differences and Contrarietzes, thatone would think*
“ there could be little or no Debate about the Matter.’'

This Carena confirms by several Instances. In the City of Logronno irt
Spain, many Persons were condemned for VVitchcraft, and yet afterwards
'twas discovered that there were many Deceits in the Affair of their Condem-
nation, upon which Account the Effects of the condemned Persons were not?
confiscated, nor their Sentences fixed upon the Churches‚ but they were re-
conciled, and moreover declared capable of any Office of the Inquisition:
He gives another Instance of four Women, accused before the Ordinary by
some. others who had been condemned to Death, and hanged, who appealed
to the-Royal Council, to whom the Presumptions against them appeared so
very ssight, that upon finding Sureties they were dismissed, and never called
into Qestion afterwards. He reports in the same Place the Words of Fer-
rerius, who calls those Judges, Aſjhfflnffl, Judges that have πο Fear cf God,
and leſs Lovefor -Trmh, For this Reason certain Rules are prescribed to the In-
quisitors, that they may proceed n this Affair with more Caut1on.

And first, before they begin t'ne Process, there must be some Certainty
as to the Reality of the crime, whether the Offence be of that sort which
leaves the proper Traces behind it. For {t hath been obser-ved, that ionic

Judges have ordered certain Women to be punissied with Deam, fo} fion-
