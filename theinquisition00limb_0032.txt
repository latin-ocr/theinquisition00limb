6: [Noe INTRonucT1oN.

’Δ I wisi ohey Goal ialhsr than yon, and teach my Philoffipsby as long as I live. How-
ever, notwithstanding the Goodness of his Cause and Defence, he was con-
demned for lnipiety and Atheisrn, and ended his Life with a Draught of Poi-
1''on, dying a real Μαι-[γε’ for God, and the Purity of his WVorssiip. Thus we
see that in the Ages of natural Reason and Light‚ not to be orthod0x‚ or to
diffizr from the established Religion, was the same Thing as to be impious and
atheistical, and that one of the wisest Men that ever -lived was put to Death
merely on account of his Religion.

1 niust add, in Justice to the Laity, that the Judges and Accusers of Socrates
were not Priests. Melam was a Poet‚ Anytus an Artificer‚ and Lycon an Ora·
tor 3 so [liat the Prosecution was truiy Laick‚ and the Priests don't appear to
have had any Share in his Accusation‚ Condemnation‚ and Death. Nor,
indeed, was their'any Need of the Affistance of Priestcraft in this Affair, the
Prosecution ofthis excellent Man being perfecstly agreeable to the Constitution
and Maxims of the Athenian Government3 which had, to use the XVords of

Οἵ· Rogmsa late Reverend Author, incorporated or made Religion a Part ofthe Laws of
Z·'.['‘.¹'·⁰f{'⁷'‘² the civil Community. One of the Attici< Laws was to this Effe& ε ⁶ La ic be
μῖᾗῖἑιῗῖζΐι a perpetual Low, and binding at all Times, to worship our national Gods and Heroes
&e ³ publii-My, according to the Laws of our Ancostors. So that no new Gods, nor new·
Doarines about old Gods, nor any new Rites ofWorshsp, could be introduced
by any Person whatsoever, without incurring the Penalty of this Law, which
(ont. A· was Death. Thus Josephus tells us, that ’twas prohibited by Law to teach
{³¹⁰}ss ¹· ²·new Gods, and that the Punissiment ordained against those who should intro-
1's0}}„‘f‚ duce any such, was Death. ,Agreeably to this, the Orator Isocrates, pleading
Arcop. in the Grand Council of Athens, puts them in mind of the Custom and praefice
of theIr Ancestors: d ‘Ihis was their principaii Care to abolifh nothing they had re-
ceived from their Fathers in Matters of Religion, nor to make any Acadition to what
they had establzfhed. And therefore, in his Advice to Nicocles, he exhorts him
to ‘³ be of the same Religion with his Ancestors. So that the Civil Establishment of
Religion in Athens was entirely exclusive, and no Toleration whatsoever al-
Diog. lowed to those who differed from it. On this Account the Philosophers in ge,²
gaen-t. 1. 5· neral were, by a publick Decree, banilbed froin Athens, as teaching heterodox
²23?st Opinions, and corrupting the Youth in Matters of Religion, and by a Law,

Masters and Teachers of Schools, without Leave of the Senate and People,
even under Pain of Death. This Law, indeed, like the othei-,was but very short
·lived,andsoph0cles the Author of itpunished in a Fine ol five Talents. Lysima-
chus also banilhed thern from his Kingdorn. 'Tis evidentfrom these Things, ⁴that
according to the Athenian Constitution, Socrates was legally condemned for not.
