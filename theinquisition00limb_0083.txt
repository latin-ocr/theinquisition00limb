a Man after his own Heart ·, who had not given Sleep to his Eyes, nor Slumber to
his EJe-lids, till he hod gothered them together, to find out the perfefft Rule of Faith.
After this they condemned the Heresy osone Will in Christ, and declared, That
they glorified two natural Wills and Operations, indivistbly, inconvertihly, without
Confuston, and inseparahly in the fhme Lord Jesus Christ, our true God, i. e. the di-
vine Operation, and the human Operation. So that “now the Orthodox Faith
in Reference to Christ was this 3 That he had two Natures, the divine and hu-
man 3 that these two Natures were united, without Confufion, into one stngle Person 3
and that in this one fingle Perfhn, there were two distinet Wilts and Operations, the
human and divine. Thus, at last, 681 Years after Christ, was the Orthodox
Faith, relating to his Deity, Humanity, Nature and Wills, decided and set·
tled by this Synod 3 who, after having pronounced Anathemas against the Li-
ving and Dead, ordered the Burning of heretica] Books‚ and deprived several
Bishops of their Sees 3 procured an Edi& from the Emperor, commanding all
to receive their Confeffion of Faith, and denouncing not only eternal, but cor-
poral Punishments to all Recusants‚ viz. If they were Bishops, or Clergymen,
or Monks, they were to be banished. If Laymen, of any Rank and F igure,
they were to forfeit their Estates, and lose their Honours. If of the common
People, they were to be expelled the Royal City. These their definitive Sen-
tences were concluded with the usual Exclamation, of God save the Emperor,
Long live the Orthodox Emperor3 down with the Hereticks 3 cursed be Eutyches,

The next Controversy of Importance was relating to the Worship of Ima-
ges. The Respec‘t due to the Memories of the Apostles and Martyrs of the
Christian Church, was gradually carried into great Superstition, and at
Length degenerated into downright Idolatry. Not only Churches were dedi-
cated to thern, but their Images placed in them, and religious Adoration
paid to them. Plotina tells υς, That amongst many other Ceremonies intro-
duced by Pope Sixtus III. in the Fifth Century‚ he persuaded Valentinian the
younger, Emperor of the West‚ to beautify and adorn the Churches, and to
place upon the Altar of St. Peter, a golden Image of our Saviour, enriched
with Jewels, In the next Century the Images of the Saints were brought in,
and religious Worship paid to them. This appears from a Letter of Pope
Gregory's, to the Bishop ofMarseilles, who broke in Pieces certain ImageS, be-
cause they had been superstitioussy adored. Gregory tells him, I commend >¹0⁷121.9.rnd.z.
