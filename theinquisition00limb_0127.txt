sualion, Prospe& of Interest, and other temporal MotiveS‚ are commonly
made Use of to secure a Majoriry. The Orthodox have taken Care to de-
flroy all the Accounts given of this Comen, by those ofthe opposite Party 3
and Eusebius, Bishop of Casarea, hath paffed it over in Silence3 and only
dropped two or three Hints‚ that are very far from being favourable to
those reverend Fathers· In a WVord, nothing can be collected from Friends
or Enemies, to induce one to believe, that they had any of those Qialifica-
tions which were necessary to fir them for the Province they had undertaken‚
of settling the Peace of the Church by a fair, candid and impartial Deter-
mination of the Controversy that divided it: So that the Emperor Constantine,
and Socrates the Historiam, took the most efl‘efftual Method to vindicate their
Honour, by pronouncing them inspired by the Holy Ghost, which they had
great need of, to make up the want of all other Qpalifications.

The second General Council were plainly the Creatores of the Emperor
Theodosius, all of his own Party, and com-enee} to do as he bid them3 which
they did, by confirming the Nicene Faith‚ and condemning all Herelies-
The third General Council were the Creatures of Cyril, who was their Presi-
dent, and the inveterate Enemy of Nestorius, whom he condemned for Heresy,
and was himself condemned for his Rashness in this Affair‚ and excommuni-
cated by the Bissiop of Antioch. The fourth met under the Awes of the Em-
peror Marcian, managed their Debates with Noise and Tumult‚ were formed
into a Majority by the Intrigues of the Legates of Rome ; and settled the

it not be asked, How came the few Bishops, who met by Command of The&
dostus, to be fliled an Oecumenical or General Council? As they came to
decree‚ as he decreed they should, what Authority‚ with any wise Man, can
their Decifions have? As they were all of one Side, except thirty six of the
Macedonian Party‚ who were afterwards added ; what less could be expefied‚
but tha: they would decree themselves Orthodox‚ establissi their own Creed,
and anathematize all others for Hereticks? And as to the next Councir, Ι

the Direfiion and Influence ofa iwan of Cyril’s Principles and Morals‚· espe-
cially as the main T1'ansa5tion osthat Council was hurried on by a Defire of
Revenge, and done before the Arrival of the Biffiop of Antius), with his
suffragan Brethren, and condemned by him as soon as he was informed of
it; till at length the Power and Influence of the Emperor reconciled the·
two haughty Prelate83 made. them reverse their mutual Excommunications,

Cannot any one discern more of Resentment and Pride in their first Qiar- ⁷
