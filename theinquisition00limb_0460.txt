The HtsTomr of the INQU181T10N‚

which he is convieted, or the whole Time of his Offence, or all his Aecom·=
plices, if the Things are so fresh, as that he can't be supposed to have forgot-
ten them. Amongst these sort of Negatives are also reckoned by some, such
who consess before the Inquisitor heretica] Faets or Words, but who deny any
Pravity of Intention, altho’ others, as we shall soon see, call them Impenitent.

What their Punilhment ought to be, the Doetors differ. Simancas says,
That he who confesses heretical words, but denies the Pravity of Intention‚
may be condemned as Impenitent, except the Matter be doubtful. In such
Case he ought to be purged, or abjure, because of his being suspected, or put
to the Torture, which is generally the Custom.

But because this Cale osten happens in Spain, because of their new Con-
verts srom the Jews and Moors, John Royas handles this Matter largely, of

neze- which I shall here give you the Substance ·, from whence we shall know what

sort os Christians they are, which the Spanish Kings have converted to their
Church by the Fear of Punishment frorn amongst the Jews and Moors.

We know by Experience, how many there are who are detained for heretical
Pravity in the Prisons osthe Office of the holy Inquifition, who ingenuoussy con-
sess heretical Deeds and Words‚ but who absolutely deny all rash Belief, and
-Pravity of Intention. Thus a Man may confess that 116 hath said, as of-
ten happens in examining Causes of Faith, that every one may be sa-
ved in his own Se& and Opinion‚ a Jew by the Jewzfh Law, a Saracen by
the Mahometan, and a Luthcran in the Lutheran Sect. For the guilty Person
sometimes confesses in his Diseourse, that he pronounced the aforesaid Words
‚inadvertently, and th ro' the Error of his Tongue, and being asked by the In-
quifitors of heretical Pravity, Whether he believes such Things‚ he says he
never did, but that he ever held what the holy Roman Church preaches and
teaches. Thus he denies the Intention, and only confesses the Words, which
without doubt are heretical. Another Instance is of one who confeffes that he said
simple F ornication is not a mortal Sin, and yet denies all rassi Belief and Error
of Understanding, afferting that, speaking for Wantonness sake, he pronounced
the aforesaid Words to some Wenches, which are in Reality heretical Words.

An Instance of an heretical Fa& shall be in him, who being baptized, is af-
terwards circumcised, and observes the F ast called Ramadan, and the Paffover,
after the Mahometan Manner, and makes the Zalah, i. e. his Adoration or Prayer
in his own Home or in the Mosques, washing first his Body, and especially his
Privities, bending his KneeS‚ bowing down, and lifting up his Head‚ and who
feeds on Fleshes killed from the ³¹⁶ Keblczh. The new Converts in the King-
doms of Valencia, Aragon and Granada, publickly observe many other sacrile-
gious and impious Rites. Another Example is of him, who especially if he be
of the Jewzfh Race, observes the Sabbath by resraining from all Labour‚ and

observes the other Festivals of the Jews, and who confeffes such Faets and
Words, but affirms that he said or did them inadvertently and ignorantly, and
that 116 is ready to submit to the Correetion of the Church. ’Tis queried,

* The Mahometam call that Part of the World‚ where Mecca is fituated, by the Name of Kebla, to-
wards which they are obliged to turn themselves when they say their Ptayers. Mecca is fituated to-

wards the South.
