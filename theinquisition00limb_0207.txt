St. Austin determine against them in such a Case ? Why, all his Arguments tend
to this, that if they should return, contrary to the imperial Edicst, he should
not at all disapprove a capital Punilhtnent, isit was so appointed by the
Laws.

And indeed, all who since Austin have taught that Hereticks are to be per·
secuted‚ and even punished with Death, have made Use of no Authority
more than Austin's 3 and to lhew how highly they esteem his Authority‚ they
use his Arguments as the very strongest, though in themselves absurd‚ and
manifestly contrary to Scripture, to defend a Doffitrine so absolutely repug-
nant to the Nature of Christianity. From him they have borrowed the Di·
stinetion, that it is unlawful for Hereticks to persecute the Church, but the
Duty of the Church to persecute Hereticks, This is now become the com-
mon Exception of all the Mur-derers of HeretickS, with which every one armed «
with the secular Power, under a specious Pretence, persecutes and oppresses
those who differ from him: This is the principa} Argument by which the
Papists defend themselves, when they would justify their own Persecution of ·
Hereticks, and condemn all others that persecute them. And which is the
Wonder, they commend as praise-worthy and heroical what is praCtised
by their own Church against others, even when they condemn the same
Things as cruel and inhumane in thern ; as though they were exempted from
the common Law of Nature, of doing to others as they would be done by.
Conrad Brunns complains of the Hereticks and SchismatickS, that the Vandals Β. 2. c. 8:
and Donatistss in Africa, turned and executed all the Laws made against Here· ὣς·
ticks upon the Catholicks. These, says he, the Hereticks also of our Time imitate: In
thisv indeed they are worse than they 3 because they denied those Laws were ever made
against themselves ·, whereas our modern Heretieks affirm they were made, and ought
to be executed against the Catholicks‚ as may eastly be fi’en from many of their Wei-
tings. In the same Book he complains: That the Hereticks spare neither Age, ι,
nor Sex, nor Degree, nor Dignity 3 but-rage promiscuonsty against Chilclren ancl grown
Persons, W'omen and Men, Virgins and Marriecl, old Men and young. He adds,

c. 13. ’Tis cruel ancl most inhumane to ahuse the Dead: But this is peculiar to our
Hereticks and Schismaticks. T hey conceal the Bodies of Bifhops and Presbyters, W'o-
men and Virgins, whom they have harbaronsly killed, and deny them Bnrial. - T he
Bodies of some they have taken out· of their Graves, and cast upon the Ground 3Trz'p. ,ἡ 25*
others have contemptnoussy stattered into the Air the Afhes of those whom they havec. 3·
barm, ana' thrown the Bodies of some into Rivers. If any one considers the De· pope Leo, >
c-retals of the Popes, the Instruffions ofthe Inquifition, and the usual Manner Ep. 7
of proceeding in it, in which there is no Distinetion of Persons ; but all are
subjeeted to the Inquifition without Respeet to Age, Sex or Dignity‚ which
not only forbids the burying dead Hereticks, but annexes a Punishment
to those who bury thern ; and ostentimes commands their dead Bodies
to be taken up, and to be either thrown upon Dunghills, or reduced to
Ashes, and their Assies scatter'd in the Air, as shall be hereafter more large·
ly shewn ε Isay, if any one confiders these Things, he might well think lis-,22:-
nus to be in jest 3 unless he was of Aasstm’s Opinion, that the Church might
