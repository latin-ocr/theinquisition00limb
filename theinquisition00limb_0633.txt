“ having concealed any Herefies or Hereticks, or to have boasted that he
“ was innocent, and unjustly condemned, he must be examined again as an
“ Impenitent 3nor will the Sentence by which he was reconciled to the Church,

“ converted, they are to be carried back to Jayl, and admitted to Penance
“ if converted, But if they perfist in their Obstinacy and Impenitence, their
“ Sentence must be read, after which they must be immediately seized on
