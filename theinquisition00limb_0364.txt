C H A P. XII.

Concerning the Duty or Power of every M A G 1 s T R A T E.

H U S far we have treated of the Ministers which belong to the Inqui-
sition of Hereticks. The Civil Magistrate hath no Part in this Affair 3
for he is entirely excluded from all Cognizance of the Crime of Heresy. Thus
Tit. 36. Simancas teaches: “ The Cognizance of Heresy solely belongs to the Eccle-
§- ¹⁰ “ fiastical Judge, because this is a Crime committed against the F aith and
“ Religion 3 foras to those Crimes which the secular Administration knows
‘⁶ nothing of, and which are declared such by the Christian Religion, such as
“ Heresy, Schism, and others of the like sort, the Ecclefiastical Judge only
“ hath Cognizance of them. And therefore to whatsoever Branch of the se-
“ cular Judgment the Cognizance of such Crimes may at any time happen, it

‚“ must be immediately referred to the Ecclefiastical Judges.
ς, {a “ It is more largely forbidden by the royal Laws at this Day in Spain,
⁷⁴ “ that no one of the secular Judges, of whatsoever Dignity and Power, ihall
“ by any Means presume to take Cognizance even of those civil or criminal
“ Causes which belong to the Inquifitors‚ and the Judges of forfeited Effe&s;
“ no not under Pretence of relieving Persons opprefl'ed by Violence, which,
“ in other Cases, would be a most wholesome and present Remedy to redress
“ the Grievances of the Ecclefiastical JudgeS. However, if any will appeal
“ in the before—mentioned Causes, they must apply to the Council of the holy
“ Genera] Inquifition. This royal Command was dated at Burgos, March 7,

“ 1508. and renewed 1553.'’

However, they stand in need of the Arms and Power of the Magistrate,
for the punishment of Hereticks, and that they may execute the Sentences

pronounced against them. For 'tis not lawful for Ecclefiastical Persons to kill
any one. Therefore they desire to have all Magistrates obedient to their Beck

and Commands, and to have no Liberty of Conscience granted by them to He-
reticks‚ but insist on their being ready and prepared to draw their Swordsv
camment. against Hereticks at the Pope’s Command. This is the Doctrine of Maldo-
οη Mat. net, explaining the Parable of the Tares sown amongst the Wheat. For after
xiii· 26. he hath said that the Calvinists and Lutherans are to be cut off as manifest He-
reticks, he adds these Things : Not that I speak thus, as though I had not rather

have them converted than put to Death. All that] intend is to admonifh Princes, or

« because Princes may not read these Things, those who can advise them, that 'tis not
