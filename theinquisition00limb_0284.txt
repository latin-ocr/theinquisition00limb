burn’d. They also not only condemn’d John Huss, who cameto the‘Corun-
cil with Letters of safe Conducl: from the Emperor 3 but in Violation of the
publick Fami, order’d him to be burn’d alive. The Emperor, that he might
have some Pretence thus to violate his Faith, madea Decree, that Inquisi-
{ifiss'sssssssgchssniifi53¹?2⁶ss2anS‘dpsssspssfniss335502333‘135522, Ρέέἷίᾋιῖὲοὲἷῦἷξῗάἶᾶἓῗῖῗὲ
Decree are, Although they should confide in their safe ConduH, and thus come vto·
the Place of Judgment, and would- not otherwift- have come 3 and that he who
fhould make fisch a Promise, was not oblig'd by itas to any one, because he pro-
mised what was not in his Power. Afterwards also Jerome of Prague, terrifi7
ed with the dreadful Punilhment of Huſs, renounced at first, through hu-
mane Infirmity, the Do&rine of Wickleff and Hztſs 3 but soon recovered his
Courage, and boldly asserted and defended it before the whole Synod ·, upon

which they condemned him as a Relapse, and ordered him to be burn'dss
But slnce many of the Papists endeavour to wipe off this Infamy of having
violated the Faith, Ι {hall take this Occafion briefly to shew that the publick
Faith was violated in the Case ofHuss, by Command of the Synod. They de-
ny that the Synod gave their Faith to Huss, and that 'twas only the Empe-
τοῖς so that the Synod , which was the legal Judge of the Faith,
might pronounce Judgment concerning Huss's Doctrine, although the Em-¹
peror had given him Letters of safe Conduct3 because the Affair of Heresy
is wholly Ecclesiastical, and not within the Bounds of the secular Power. But
the Charge is not, that the Synod violated the Faith by condemning Huſs
of Heresy, but because they caused him to be burn’d. The Power of the s
Synod, according to the Papists themselves, extends no farther than to their
jutlging of the Faith, and pronouncing by their Sentence any one an Here*
tick and Obstinate‚ and throwing him out ofthe Bosom of the Church ; af-
ter Sentence they immediately deliver him over to the-secular Power, that
he may inflict on him the Punishments appointed by the Civil Laws. In⁴
this Manner the Synod proceeded in the Cause of Huss. After they had de-
clared him an Heretick, and degraded him in the Council, they added this-
}Decree to their Sentencez· This holy Synod ofConstance, cmzfidering‚ N. Β,
that the Church of God cannot proceed samber, decrees that John Huss fhall be
left to the βιαίαν Judgment, and given up to the seculczr Court. Thus far there-z
fore the Church performed her Duty ; All the rest belonged to the seculae
JurisdiCtion. But here the Emperor had taken Care for Huſs his Secursty, by·
giving him Letters of fase Condust, and therefore could not condemn him tc>
be burn'd without violating his Faith ε And therefore the Synod, to remove·
this Scruple from the Emperor, pronounced by their Decree, that he who
bound himself by such a Promise was in no Manner obliged by it as to any
one, because he promised what was not properly in his Power to grant. St>
that the Synod did not properly violate the Faith given by themselves, but
pronounced by their Decree, that EmperorS, Kings and Princes were in no-
Manner obliged by their Promises of fase Conduct, and that therefore they'
might with a safe conscience break thern, even when granted by Ipubliclc.
