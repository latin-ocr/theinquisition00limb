The Htsrom‘ ofthe INQUISITIONJ

the Church compel her lost Sons to return, since these lost Sons have compelled 'others to

their Destrucftion? Especially as the holy Motber more kindly embraces those, who,

having been not so much compelled as seduced, are made to return by terrible tho’

wholsome Laws, into her Bosom, and rejoices over them much more than over those she

hatb never lost. What, doth it not belong to the Pastoral Care, to recover those

Sheep, when found, to the Lord’s Flock, by the Terror of Stripes, or even Pains, if
they restst, which having not been violently fhatched away, have wandered from

the Floclc, thro' fhst and gentle Perswaston ‚P And a fevaines afterwards : Be.-

cause they cannot she-w that they are compelled to Evil, they argue, that they ought not

to be compelled even to what is good. But we have fhewn that Paul was compelled

by Christ, sb that the Churchimitates its Lord in compelling those, first waiting before she

conzpels any, that the Preaching of the Prophets might be fulfilled with respett to the

Faitb of Kings and Nations. For to this Purpose may be understood that of bleffed
Paul, Having in a Readiness to revenge all Disobedience, when your Obe-

dience is first fulfined. Hence also our Lord himself, first commands the Guests

to be invited, and afterwards compelled to his great Supper. For when the Ser„-

vants answered him, Lord, it is done as thou commandedst 3, and yet there,
is Romn, he said, Go out into the High-ways and HedgeS, and compe] them

to come in. Now in those who were first kindly brought in„ is fulfilled thefirst Obe-

dz'ence 3. in those whoare compelled the Disobedience is revengcd.⁴ Forwhat is this,

Compel them to come in ·, when ’tis first said, Bring in 3 and the Answer was,

It is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is Room? If he would have

it understood, of being compelled by the Terror of Miracles, those were done in great-

est abundance, in Bebalf of those who were first called, especially of those of whom

'tis said, The Jews seek Sigus. The like may be read in his 204tthpistle

to Donatus, a Donatist Presbyter, in whichhe relates the various Cruelties of
the Donatzsts and Circumcellians, and writes that many were reduced to the Uni-

ty of the Church, by the Laws made against them. After a long Account of
this, he answers an Objeffion of the Donatists, that the Catholicks coveted

and took away their Goods, and ⁴shews the Falfhood of it. See also his 116th

Epistle to the Donatists.

From hence we may see that Austin hath very fully taught, and endeavoured
by many Arguments to prove, that Hereticks ought to becompelled to. return
to the Church by external Violence and theFear of Punishments, thoihe was
not willing that they Ihould be put to Death. Wherefore he not only writes to
Dulcitius the Tribune in his 6oth Epistle ε ‘Thou hast not received by any Laws the
Power of the Sword over them, nor do any of the Imperial Constitutions, which thou
art intrusted with the Execution of, command thee to put them to Dente„ But in his
158th and 159tthp‘1stle to Marcellinus, and in his 16oth to Apringius, he
largely intercedes to, prevent their Death, and that their Punifhment might not
reacb fi> far. And-in his 127th Epistle to Donatus, Proconsul of Africa, he
thus writes: Since there are sicch‚terrible Judges and Laws, to prevent their inp
curring the Punifhment of the eternal Judgment, we would have them correc‘ted, not
destroyed: We would not that the neceffary Disciplz'ne towards them should be,neg-,
leani, nor that they should be punilhed according to their Deserts. Pzn such afle-
