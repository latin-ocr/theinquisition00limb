who spread Contention amongst Christians, and taught them to bite a'nd de·
vour one another, upon Account of Circumcifion, and such-like Trifles; Men
that were the Plagues and Corrupters of the Society they belonged to. Men
who caused such Divifions, and who caused them out osa Love to their own
BeHy, deserved to have a Mark set upon them, and to be avoided by all who
regarded their own Interest, or the Peace of otherS.

What the Apostle means by delivering to Satan, Iam not able certainly
to determine. lt was not, I am sure, the putting the Person in Jail, or tor-
turing his Body by an Executioner5 nor sending him to the Devil by the
Sword or the Fagot„ One Thing included in it undoubtedly was, his Sepa-
ration from the Christian Church .· Put away from amongst your salves that wicked 1 Cor. vs
Perfim, which probably was attended with some bodily Distemper, which, as it13·
came from God, had a Tendency to bring the Person to Confideration and Re-
fleffion. The immediate Defign os it was‘the Destruetion ofthe Flesti, to cure
him os his Incest, that, by Repentance and Reformarmn, his Spirit might be
saved in the Day osChrist; and the Power by which the Apostle inflifted this
Punishment, was peculiar to himself, which God gave hinist-r Edifitarion, and: Can
notfor DestruHion .· So that whatever is precisely meant by delivering to Satanff· δ’·
· it was the Punishment ofa notorious Sin3 a Punishment that carried the Marks
ofGod's Hand, and was defign'd for the Person's Good, and was actually
instrumental to recover and save him, 2 Cor· ii. But what Resemblance is*
there in all this to Persecution‚ in which there is no Appearance of the Hand
of God, nor any Marks but those of the Cruelty and Vengeance of Men 3
no Immorality puniffied, and, generally speaking, nothing that in its Nature
deserves Punishment, or but what deserves Encouragement and Applause‚
And ’tis very probable that this is what St· Paul means by his wzssing those cut
eff who disturbed the Peace of the Galatian Christi-ans, by spreading Divisions
amongst them, and exciting persecutions against them3 though, I confess, if
St. Paul meant more, and pray'd to God that those obstinate and incorrigible
Enemies to Christianity‚ who, for private Views of worldly Interest, raised
perpetual Difiurbances and Persecutions where-ever they came, might receive
the just Punishnient of their Sins, and be hereby prevented from doing far·
ther Mischief, I don't see how this would have been inconsistent with Charity,
· or his own Charafien as an inspired Apostle.

It may poffibly be urged, that though the Things censured in these Places
are Immoralities, yet that there are other Pafl'ages which refer only to Prin-
ciples‚ and that the Apostle Paul speaks against them with great Severity:
As particularly, Ifany Man preach any other Gospel tmtojou, than that ye have re· Gal. ς, ρ,-
‘eiveds ²⁶¹¹ him be accursecl. And again, A Man that is an Heretick‚ aster the first τὴ, Μ’
andsecond Admonition, rejeff. As to the first of these, nothing can be moreio.
evident than that the Apostle pronounces an Auathema only against those who
subverted the Christian Religion, such who taught that it was insufficient to
Salvadon, without Circumcifion, and Submiffion to the Jewtfh Law: Asthe
Gospel he taught, was what he had received from Christ, he had, as an·

Apostle, a Right to warn the Churches he wrote to against corruptingsfhe
