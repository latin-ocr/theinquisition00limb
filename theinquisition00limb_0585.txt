cause, they say, ’tis often found, that those whose Confeffions have been once
interrupted, will not afterwards confess any more, or will retra& what they
have begun to confess-

If there arises any Thing doubtful, worthy os Confideration, from the Cap. ιε.
Criminals Answers‚ which 'tis proper to know how the Denouncer and Wit-
neffes understood it, they are to be called again and re-examined. For In-
stanoe, whether the Prisoner spoke what he said in jest, or earnest ἓ Or as re-
peating the Words os other Persons, or afferting it as his own Mind and Opi—
nion? But here the Inquifitor must be cautious, that he doth not by re—ex.
amining the Depofition or Witneffes discover any Thing, from whence the
Deposer or Witneffes may gather what the Criminal hath consessed3 but
must so interrogate him, as tho' 'twas only for -his own Information.

These are the principal Cautions which they are commanded to observe in
the Examination of Criminals, all which the Inquifitors do very carefully
and exaffly keep t0‚ as far as they find any of them of any Service to draw
Confeffions from the Prisoners own Mouths, but which they eafily omit,
when they think proper, and it will serve their Turn, especially when they
would be of any Use and Affistance to the Criminals. That they may draw
from them a Confeffion, they are at first kind, and pretend the fincerest
Affeetion, and 'tis recommended to the Inquisitors to treat the Criminals ten-
derly, ‘whilst they are heard, interrogated and examined‚ and to remember
that they themselves are Men, who might have fallen into the same or like
Crimes, unless they had been guarded by the Grace of God, and not to suffer
the Criminals, altho’ common and mean Persons, to stand whilst they are
hearing, but to command them to fit down. If in their Confeffion, or in the
Beginning or Progress of ‘their Examination they are so moved with Grief,
or affected with Repentance, as to ssied T ears, or to implore the Mercy of
the Judges‚ and ask Pardon for their Offence upon their bended Knees, or
holding up their Hands, or beating their Breasts, all these Circumstances
must be inserted by the Notary in the Acts of the Process.

But if the Prisoners don’t confess those Things of which they are accused,
-as it may often happen, either because the Accusations are false, or because
they don’t remember Things, especially if at the Distance of several Years,
and what was said was not in the least premeditated‚ but inadvertently and
in common Discourse, they make use of a quite different Method of Inquisi-
tion‚ and try every Art to catch and insnare these miserable Criminals, al-
ready tired out by their vile Imprisonment, Arts not always wholly agreeable
to the Admonitions just now mentioned. This is well described by Eymerick, Direff.
and therefore I shall give it here, that the Manner of proceeding against the Imm-3-
Pridsonsssrs in the Jayl os the Inquifition, may 'be more distinctly and fully
un er ood. -

According therefore to the DireEtory of Eymerick, the Inquilitors don’t in-n. εξ.
terrogate all Persons of the same Things, nor in the same Order, but
begin and carry on ‘their' Inquifition, either from what the Accusers
and Denouncers say, or ,from the Answers of the Witneffes, or from »ηιξκιε
