The H1s10RY ofthe INQUISITION. 229

ᾖσι including the little Claufhs, Sentences, and Heads which are inserted in the Books
of C atholick Writers, who cite and explain them. This Caution is also to be ohserved,
that the Book of the Epistles and Gospels, as 'tis called, written in the vulgar fongae,
is comprehendet! in this Prohibition‚ although there be sometimes added short Expost-
tions in certain Parts and Gospels ; for it is almost all written out of the sacred Text,
and therefore prohibited upon account of the Danger of Error, to which the ignorant
common People are fhbjett, through a corrupted Understanding‚ and other Inconveni-
ences that have been found to arise by Experience. And that all Scruples may be a-
voided, the Reader is to understand which is the vulgar Tongue, and which not. T he
Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Caldee, Syriack‚ Ethiopick, Perfick and Arabick
are not, being those original Languages, which are not now used in common Conversa-
tion. All other Languages whatst>ever arcto be understood to be vulgar. Ihave
thought proper to add this Rule, Word for Word, that the Tyranny of the
P-apists‚ in prohibiting the reading of the holy Scripture, which they endea-
vour to diffemble‚ conceal, and by various Pretexts to disguise, may clearly
and evidently appear.
From these Things 'tis plain, that the Inquifitors, especially in Spain, have οἰκεῖ,
a very great Power in the Prohibition of Books 3 because these expurgatory tnq. Ey-
lndexes are made and published by the Command of the Inquifition in themer. cm·
Kingdom of Spain. How large this Power is, Pegna gives us a full Account. ²²'p‘w'2'
“ The Bilhops and Inquifitors may condemn and prohibit in their Dioceses all
“ Books which contain opinions, expressly condemned by the Choreb, al-
“‘though writtenby Authors not condemned by Name, because Th‘ings
“ once condemned may be forbidden with any new Condemnation. Also all
“ Books suspected of Heresy,‚whatsoever be the Heresy they are suspected of,
“ though publish'ed by CatholickAuthors. For fince they may proceed a«

“ may inuch nliore prodeed againstfuspedted Bdoks‚ and prohibit such² as contaih
“ suspedted Propofitions. For, says he, Books are much more likely to do
“ harm than Men, because. those who read them more-firmly insist· on the
“ Things contained in them, than, those who only hear the Conversations
“ of: others ς and fai-tter because Hereticks by teaching can scarce
“ spread their DoCtrine ovet· a fingle City, whereas Books may ,be carried
“ stom Place to Place, and infe& not only a City, but Kingdoms and* Pro·
“ vinces. Alsoall Books containing Propofitions scandamus, dangerous, er-
“ roneous, savouring of Heresy, and any ways differing esrom the Catholick
‘¹ Faith, and not agreeable to Christian Piety and good Manners. This was
“ provided for by-Paul III. in a certain Rescript‚ beginning‚. In Apostolici
“ culminis. The same is to be said of sucerooks as contain double, doubtful
‘⁴ or dubious Propofitions, which contain a double Sense‚ one heretical,
“> the other Catholick. Thesemay be prohibited by the ¹inquisitors, till such
“ Propofitions are declared in a Catholick Sense. In» the Index also of prohi-
“ -bited Books, at the End of the tenth Rule, Power is granted to the Bilhops
