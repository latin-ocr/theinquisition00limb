The Hrsronv ofthe INQUISITION- 137

ss cardinal, and Legate a Latere sent to erest the Inquifition‚ could stay fix
“ Months in this Kingdom, without being discovered. For at that Time
“ the Ambaffadors ofKing John ΙΙΙ. were at the Court of Rome to solicite
“ the Affair of the Inquifition, to whom the King would undoubtedly have
“ fignified the Coming of such a Nuncio, and they would have certified him
‘⁵ of the Truth of it, as they had fix Months to do it in, which yet was ne-
“ ver done. At the same time he wonders, as he well may do, at Paramus,
“ that he did not more accurately trace out the Original of that Inquifiti0n‚
“ of which he intended to creat, even though he himself is a Minister in
‘⁶ it to this Day, and must know the Ministers of that Time, because there
“ could be no Difficulty in looking over the Bulls of its Institution or
“ Foundation, in which we have an Account of it to the present Time in
“ a continued Series without any-Intermiffionf'

He thinks Paramus was a little too credulous‚ because, though he confesses‚
“ That Sahavedra was a wicked Man, accustonied to F rauds, and a Cheat, and
“ that such an Event seems very improbable, and contrary to his Understand-
“ ing 3 yet nevertheless believes that it happenedjust as he relates it, and thinks
“ it absolutely certain, upon the sole Authority ofSaha-vedra, who thus wrote
“ concerning himself: '⁹ And he therefore thus refutes Paramus, who could
not persuade himself to think that Sahavedra would dare to fasten such a Crime
upon himself. ‘⁶ As though a Knave, a Cheat‚ and an infamous Fellow‚
‘⁶ would not think it the greatest Honour to be had in universal Remem-
“ brance for so famous an Undertaking, or refuse to affert that this was the
“ Cause of his Punishment and Condemnation to the Gassies, that hereby he
“ might conceal the real Crimes that brought him to this deserved Punistiment.”

After the Inquisition had been introduced into Portugal‚ three general In-Ssusa, ,21-
dulgences were granted to the whole Nation of the Descendants from the He- Fls-rs. rn-
brew Converts, in the whole Kingdom and Dominions, subject to it, :indq³‘³s2²’‘²·‘
which were publiffled all over the Kingdom. The first was granted by Cle-c' Μ’
ment VII. by a Bul] expedited‚ Ap. 7th. An. 1533. which had not its Effecit.
Afterwards Paul III. who succeeded Clement in the Popedom, confirmed the

Inquifidon, of which I have given an Extra& out of Bzovius. The second
was given by the same Paul III. May 11, 1547. For whereas the Inquifi·
tors‚ as they say, had before proceeded with great Moderation in Favour
of the new Converts‚ the Good of the Church required that they should
proceed against Judaisers according to the Rigour of the Law. And there-
fore the Pope reduced the Method of Process in the Inquifition‚ according
to the Form of Law. But least the new Converts and their Children should
become subjest toa rigorous Inquifition for their past Errors‚ he granted a
general Pardon. This was published June 10, 1548. The third was grant-
ed by Clement VIII. Aug. 23, 1604. and publiihed in Portugal, Jan. 16, 1005.
The Causes os it, as we may gather from the Bull it sels, were three. fii-st,
