. Second&⁸ Whether the Inquisitor may proceed against those by whose Hc’lp, tht,
Counsel, or Affi’nt‚ such or ficch a Christian apostatises, and denies the Faith ofChrisiv‘,
which·›he hath·0nce received 3 and alfh against his Favourers, Receivers, and De·
fenders,⁴ whether they are Jews, or of any other Condition and State.

Those of Padua replied‚ <Ibat the Inquisttor may and ought to proceed against fiich,
as against Favoumrs, Receivers, and Defenders of Hereticks. Because, although
Jews are tolerated by the Church in their Rites, yet by the Nature of their Crime,
which they commit against the Church, they are to be restrained by Ecclcfiastical Se-
verity, aad because he ought to forfeit his Privilege who abuses the Power intrusted'
with him, Those of Bologna say the same, viz. Thatfhch are to be severely pu·
nished. Yet they advifi’ that fitch should not beproceeded against with the last Ex-
tremity, not to the fhedding their Blood, nor to their being delivered over, or left to
the secular Arm. But that they may and ought to be punifhed with a Fine, Banish-
ment, Imprisonment, and also with an indirebt Excommunication‚ and the like, as
the Nature of their Offences require. Again, ficch ought to be proceeded against, a}
Favourers‚ Receivers and Defenders of Hereticks, who give Counsel, Affistance and
Favour to such an Apostate‚ by keeping him in their House‚ feeding him, giving hine
Moncy, and accompanying him out of the City, sothat what is done may not come

to the Knowledge of Chrfiians, or by admitting him to Judaise in a Synagogue, and ·

the like. But these are to be punilhed lest than the former, because these seem to be
Favourers only ·‚ but the former, properly speakingr Makers of Hereticles. From-
these also the Truth may be forced by moderate Torture, if they will not themselves
confcss it, since there are thcffes or'violent Siqsbicions against them, that they have
committed these or toe like Things to the Prejtia'ice of- the Christian Faith. ‘I he
Doo‘tors of Ferrarafiibfirribed to this Decifion.

Thirdty, Whether an Inquisitor, having violent Prefiimption against such Persons‚-
that they do not speak the T ruth, whilst be is making Inquisttion against them in the
aforesaid and other like Crimes, may force it from them by Torture, st) as not to shed
their Blood, by the secular Executor or Judge, and proceed against them to Canoni-
cal Punzfhment5‚ if they are convic‘i'ed, or confeſs. They of Padua answered in the Af.
firmative, to which those of Bologna agreed. The Truth,.stzy they, may be forced
from them, if they will not confess it, by Punishments not extending to the shedding
their Blood, by the secular Judge, at the Command of the Inquifitor, when there are

legal W itnff’5, or violent Prefhmptions that they have committed the aforesaid or like ·’

Things. Campegius adds here, Observe, Ibeseech-you, the Scruple of the
Antients, as to the Punishrnents of Torum-e, because they would not have
them used by the Ecclefiastical Judge, but by the secular one at the Com⁴
mand of the Ecclefiasti‘cal. But now this Scruple is entirely removed -by

Cle. Multorum. de haema-§z Duro tamen. ‘Those of F errata gave the sanie Asi-

vice, viz. that the Inquifitors may and ought to proceed against stich, by whose
Help‚ Counsd, or Affent, any one hath apostatised.

Those of Padua moreover say, that the Truth may allo· be extorted by the fiune
Pumshments, if they deny that which is proved by ftveral W'itnff’s, although the
Witncffi’s who prove it say, that the aforestzid Crimes were committed by the Hclss,

Counsel and Affistance of the Jews officch a City, and yet doth not severally v ‹wfsyegfi
