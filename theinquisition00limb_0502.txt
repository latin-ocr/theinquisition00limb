1602. But in Portugal the Inquifitors General may, by the Conceffion of Paul
IV. to Cardinal Henry, Dec. 10. 1560. grant Leave to the inquisitors and
other Persons of approved Life and Religion, if they ate proper, and ss<ilful
and learned in Divinity, and not at all suspeffited, to read any prohibited Books
whatsoever, sor this Reason only, to enable them to oppose and refute Here-
ticks. The same Power that is granted to the Inquifitors, is also understood
to be granted to the Deputies of the Inquisition in the Kingdom of Portugczl.
Because, as they enjoy the Privileges of Inquisitors, and have a decisive
Vote in Causes, and are Judges in Causes of Heresy, and can punish Here-
ticks, as well as burn their Books, they may read the same prohibited Books‚
which the Inquisitors themselves are permitted to read. This they may

with much greater Reason do, who are of :the Council of the supream Se·
nate of the Inquisition.

C H A P. XV,

OfPoLYGAMISTs.

Olygamists are those who marry several Wives at once. The Tribunal
of the Inquifitors takes Cognizance of their Cause‚ because they are
suspected of Heresy, and are presumed to think wrong concerning the Sacra..
ment of Matrimony, and to hold it lawful to have several Wives at once.
When a Polygamist is in the Jayls os the holy Office, and he is known
to be the sels same Person, either by his Confeffion, or by Witneffes‚ and
when his Crime is proved, heis asked, Whether he truly believes that it is,
and hath been lawful for a Christian Man, after the Evangelick Law, to
marry several Wives at once? Ifhe answers affirmatively, he is taken for a
formal Heretick‚ and is to be punished as such. But if he answers negative-
ly, and like a Catholick, denying that he had any heretical Intention, but
was rather enticed to a second Matrimony by the Lust and Concupiscence
of the Flesh, he must be put to the Torture concerning his Intention, that
the Judges of the Faith may certify themselves what the POlygamist truly
thinks concerning the Faith, because the Crime of Heresy is secret, and lies
hid in the Mind. This is peculiar to this holy Office ·, though, according to
the Laws of it, they rightly apply the Torture. For fince the Fa& which
the Criminal consefles, or of which he is convieted⁹ may be committed with·
out any Error of the Mind‚ but for some other Cause, for instance, Con-
,cupiscence, the Criminal is tortured concerning his Intention and Belies os
those Things which he hath done, And thus we see, that ’tis a smaller Crime
in the Church of Rome to marry two Wives thro' Lust and carnal Concu-

piscence,
