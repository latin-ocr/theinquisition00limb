ther the Sentence pronounced was against the Albigenst’s or Valdensen which
manifest Difference hath induced me to believe that they were two distin&
δώῃ though I have hitherto been in the common Opinion, that they
were but one. And that this may appear more clearly, I ssiall here give
out of the Book of Sentences, the Docti-ines common to both, and those in
which they differ'd, and describe their particular Rites and CustomS.

The Opinions common to them both were these: Every Oath is unluwfulfol· 39-50
and stnful3 and therefore they would never, upon any Occafion, take anfhl· 9⁶⁹
Oath.

Concerning Penonce and the Confcffion of Sins: The Albigenst’s are said tofol- 400
believe, ThasConfcffion made to the Priests of the Church of Rome, fignifies nothing s
‘shut neither the Pope nor any other of the Church of Rome cun dbfhlve asty one
sronz his Sins3 but that they have the Power of Abfhlving from their Sins, all

those who become of their Seu, by the Imposttion of Hands.
> Almost the same Things are ascribed to the Valdenses, that they teach,

‘That they have Power from God only, even cis the Apostles had, of confcffing Men fil, 96·
and VVomen of their Sins, who believe them, and are willing to confess to them:

‘Ihat they hear their Confeffions, and enjoyn them Penancefor their Sins 3 although

these who hear their Confeffions, are not ordnined by the Church, are not Priests or
Clerks, but Laicks only ; and though they confes} that they have not, in the least, reu
ceived this Power from the Church of Rome. And farther, in most of the Sen-
tences against the Valdenses, we find, That the>¹ confcffed their Sins to one of the
Valdenses, ond received Absolution and Penunce from him, und believed that the

said Confcffion and Absolution, and Penance, as much avnil'd to the Salvation of

the Soul, as though they had been confeffid to cz proper Priest. But their Doctrine

is best understood by the Sentence of Huguetct‚ the Wi'fe of John, of Vienna:

‘I hat God only cun absolve from Sins·‚ ond that he who receives Confefflon, can only fh'l. 1474
advist’ what a Mun ought to do, and enjoin Penance 3 and that a wise and prudent
Person may do this, whether he be cz Priest or not.

As to the Church of Rome, the Albigenses are said to believe, That thereftl.40.
are two Churches, one merciful, viz. theirs and the Church of Christ3 which
retains that Faith, in which every one, and without which no one can he stived:

The other a cruel one, viz. T he Church of Rome, which is the Mother of For-
nications, the Temple of the Devil, and Synagogue of Satan 3 and that no one cun

be saved in the Paith of that Church. And elsewhere we read, Thnt no fil, 3,
Man can be saved, that is not received by them, and unleſs he die of their Sed.

The Valdenses are said to have taught almost the same Things: ‘Thac they fol. 961²
are not subject to the Roman Pontiff, nor to the Prelates of the Church of Rome:

§that they cannot be excommunicated by the Pope, nor the other Prolates of that
Church .· That they ought not to obey the Pope, when he commands them to forsake and
abJ'ure their Seu, us condemned by the Church ε ‘That the Church of Rome stns,
and acts unlawfully and unjustly against them, because it persecutes and condemns
them. And that they farth'er taught, That the Prelcztes of the Church os Rome, fil. 128. 2⁷⁷.
are blind Leaders of the Blind ; do not preserve the T ruth of the Gospel‚ nor imi-
tate the apostolick Poverty 3 and that the very Church cs Rome is an Hense Of [ιὶζῇἸ
