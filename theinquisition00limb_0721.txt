The H1sT⁷oRY ofthe INQursrmoN.

'“ the Flames for Heresy, was· absolved by the secular Judges‚ and those who
“ had condemned her, condemned to pay Costs.'” ButSz'mizncas believes these
Things and others of the same kind, were either feigned out ot Hatred to the
holy Inquifition, or else rthly and unjustly done by wicked and unsltilfi115 f
,Judges, and thinks that the secular judge is bound in a Cause of Heresy ' 4: '⁵

mediately, and, as they say, with his Eyes shut, to execute the Sentencemdf

the Ecclefiastical Judge, without any Cognisance or Affurance of the Justice
of it. And this is now most exactly observed in Spain and Portugal. In [1252
Accounts of the Spanifh Court, lately publilhed by a noble Frena& Lady‚ xvi—,0
‘attended the Queen out of France, there is an Instance ofa Jewifh Girl, scaro:
entred into her seventeenth Year, extreamly beautiful, who, in a publick A&
ofFaith at Madrid, An. 1680. June 30. together with twenty others of hes
Nation‚ of both SexeS, being condemned to the Stake‚ turned her 122me the

Queen, and prayed, that out of her Goodness and Clemency she might be de-
livered from the most dreadful Punishment of the Fire‚ in these VVordst

Nor must the Inquisitor ssiew to the Lay Judge the Process made by him ;
. but the secular Magistrate must immediately, and without Delay, put in Ex-
ecution the Sentence of the Ecclefiastical Judge. If he omits to do it, or de-
fers the Execution beyond the usual Time, without a legal Cause, the Inqui-
fitor may compel him to execute it by Ecclefiastical Censure. Alexander IVe
bath, in the fullest Manner, given this Power to the Inquisitors by a Rescript‚
beginning, Ad audientiam.

But in this Affair the Custom of Provinces is different. In Spain, as soon as
-ever the Sentence ofthe Relapsed or Impenitent, or any others who are to be
delivered over to the secular Court, is read, the secular Judges receive them
immediately into their Court, and having pronounced the Sentence of Death
or Burning, carry them direffly to the Place of Execution. In many Cities
of Italy the secular Judges keep in their Jayls the Criminals left or delivered
over to them by the Inquifitors three or four Days before they put them to
Death ς which seems to be done by Authority of Innocent IV. in a Bull begin--
ning, Ad exstirpanda, where we thus read. As to those who are condemned for
Heresy, by the Diocesczn or his Vicar, or by the aforesaid Inquisttors, let the chiefi'vla-
gistrate or Ruler, or his special Mfftzger, receive them when they are left to him,
and immediately, or within five Days at least, put in Exscution the Constitutiom
made against such Perfims. And they may be compelled to this by the Punish—
ment of Excommunication, and other Ecclefiastical Censures, by a Rel'cript
ofInnocent VIII. beginning, Dileeeus Filius, in these VVords. Ity'oin and com-
mand the said sesular Officials, under the Penalty of Excommunicotion, alni orl-rer
