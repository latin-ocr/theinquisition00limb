tc foresaid Se& and Heresy, and F ollowers and Profeffors of the same, hold
ει and dogmatize‚ that every Catii, without Exception or Exposition, is pro·
(ε hibited of God, and is unlawful, and a Sin ς. and this we have heard from
“ your own Mouth‚ that you so believe and hold, by applying to this Pur-2
“ posethe Words of the holy Gospel, and of St. James the Apostle, of not
κ Swearing, tho' in a mad and mistaken Sense: WhereaS, according to the.
κ sound Doctrine of the Saints, and Doerors of the Church, and Tradition
κ of the said Holy Catholick Church, 'tis not only lawful but necessary to
‘⁶ swear for attesting the Truth in Judgment‚ and also by a Statute long
‘⁶ since published against the foresaid Error, ’tis appointed, that those who
‘⁶ by a damnable Superstition refuse an Oath‚ and will not swear, shall be for
“ this Reason declared HeretickS, and subjefized to the Penalties ordered by
“ the Canon. Item, Thou thy sels hast ostentimes‚ and before many of us,
“ being canonically and judicially required to swear for the Truth‚ wholly
‘⁶ refused to swear, and yet refusest it, afl'erting that you believe that 'tis
“ prohibited by God, and unlawful‚ and a Sin to swear at all. Item, From
“ the same Fountain of Error, and mistaken Understanding, the foresaid Se&
“ and Heresy afferts‚ that all Judgment is prohibited of God, and by Conse-
“ quence that 'tis a Sin, and against the divine Prohibitizn, that any Judge,
‘⁵ in any Case, or for whatsoever Cause, ffiouldjudge any Man to bodily Pu-
“ nishment‚ or to Death ; applying‚ without a proper Expofiti0n‚ the Words
“ <of the holy Gospel, where it is written, Judge not, that ye be not judged 3 Item,
‘⁶ Thoufhalt not kill, not understanding nor receiving them as the holy Roman
‘⁵ Church understands and delivers them to the Faithful, according to the
‘⁶ Doctrine of the 'Fathers and Doctors, and canonical Sanetion33 which said
‘⁶ Sanctions the said Se& departing from the rightPath‚ neither receives nor
“ accounts vahd, but despises, renounces, and condemns, Item, Most per-
“ niciously erring about the Sacrament of true Penance, and the Keys of
‘⁶ theChurch ; they say, and teach‚ and hold, that they have Power from God,
“ as the Apostles had, of hearing the Confeffions of the Sins of all that are
“ willing to confess, and of absolving and enjoining Penances: And they do
“ hear the Confesfions of such, and enjoin those who confess to them Pe-
“ nances for their Sins, tho' they are not ordained Clerks or Priests by any
‘⁴ Bishop of the Roman Church, but are mere Laicks, and confess they have
‘⁶ not any such Power from the Roman Church, but rather deny it, and in-
“ deed have it not fron] God, nor from his Church, fince they are with-
·“ out the Church, and cut off from the Church, out of which there is no
“ true Penance or Salvation. Item, Thou thy self hast confeffed in Judg-
“ ment, that long fince thou hast confeffed thy Sins severally to four of
