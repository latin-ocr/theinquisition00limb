which we pastae, hythe Gift of God, and the Height of our Dignity, demand

Enemies of the Faith, and for the Extirpation of heretical Pravity, ‘that we should

to the secular Power‚ shall be punished according to their Desterts. If any of them,
after their being apprehended, shall return to the Unity of the Faith, through the
Fear of Death, let them suffer perpetual Imprisonment‚ and do Penance according to
the Canons. Farther, whatsoever Hereticks shall be found in the Cities‚ Towns‚ or
other Places of the Empire‚ by the Inquzfitors appointed hy the Apostolick See, or
other orthodox Persons zealous for the Faith 3 let those who have Jurisdic‘tion there,
seize their Perseus, at the Instance of the Inquisttors and other Catholicks, and
keep them in strici Custody, till being condemned by the Cenfiire of the Church, they
perzfh by an accursed Death‚ for their denying the Sacraments of Faith‚ and Life.
We condemn alh to the fiune Punishment‚ all whom the Crafi‘ of the deceitful Enemy
fhall employ as Advocates, unlawfully to defend the Error of these Hereticks, especial-
ly stnce those who are defiled with such chedness‚ are equal in Guilt 3 unless they de-
fist upon proper Admonition‚ and wesely consult the Preservation of their Lives. We
subjeb? also to the same just Punifhment‚ those, who being convitted of Hercss( in any
one Place, fly to another, that they may more safely pour out the Poison of their he-
retical Pravity ς unleſs in this Instance, they have a T e imony in their Favour from
those who have been converted to the Faith from the same Error, or from those who
have convinced them of their Heresy, which in this Case we allow may lawfully be
done. We condemn alst) to Death‚ all such Hereticks, who being brought to T rial,
shall abjure their Heresy when in extreme Danger of Life, if afterwards convicted of
having dzffembled and taken a false Oath, and of having willingly relapsed into the
same Error, that therehy their vile Diffimulation may be more destruetive to them-
selves, and their Falsehood meet with its deserved Punishment. We farther deprive
Hereticks, their Receivers and Favourers, of all Benefit of Proclamation and Ap-
peal 3 being willing that every Seed of this heretical Stain should, by all Meam, be
extirpated out of our Empire‚ in which the true Faith ought ever to be preserved.
Moreowr, as we have received greater Favours from the Divine Mercy, and are
exalted to an higher Dignity than the Children of Men, we ought to pay the more
fhlemn Services of Gratitude. If then we manifest our Displeafiu‘e against those who
contenzn us, and condemn Traytors in their Person5‚ and by stripping their Children of
their Inheritance‚ how justly fhall we he more incensed against those who blaspheme the
Name of God, and revile the Catholick Faith, and deprive‚ hy our Imperial Authority,
all Hereticks‚ their Receivers, Abettors and Advocates‚ and their Heirs and Poste-
rity‚ evento the second Generation, of their temporal Estates, publick Offices and Ho-
nours, that they may continually mourn at {he Remembrance of their Fathers Crimes,
