Euseb· vice. The Biihops of each fide had already interested the P'eople in their
J'if·C0”s{·Qarrel‚ and heated them into such a Rage that they attacked- and fought
''3'0'4''’tv'ith‚ wounded and destroyed each other, and acted with such Madness as to*
commit the greatest lmpicties for the sake of Orthodoxy ; and arrived to thar:>
pitch ofInsolence‚ as to offer great Indignities to the imperial Images. The
old Controversy about the Time of celebrating Easter being now revived‚
added Fuel to the Flames, and render’d their Animofities too furious to be ,
a eased.

Ί efirst Ρὲοηβαηίῐηε being greatly disturbed upon this Account‚ sent Letters rothe
generat Bifhops of the several Provinces ofthe Empire to affemble together at Nice in

, lbid. through hopes of Profit, and others out of Curiofity to see such a Miracle of
c 6. an Emperor, and many of thern, as Sozomen informs us, to negotiare their own
z. BH. private Affairs, and to redress their Grievances, by accufing those who haer
.c. 17· injured them. The Number ofthem was three Hundred and eighteen, besides
vast Numbers of Presbyters, Deacons, Acolythists‚ and others. The Eccle-
siastical Historians tell us, that in this vast Collection of Bishops some were re-
markable for their Gravity, Patience under Sufferings, Modesty‚ Integrity,
Eloquence‚ and the like Virtues ·‚ but yet they all agree that there were other-s» .
of very different Characters. Eusebius tells us, some came to the Council with
Theod. worldly Views of Gain ·, and Theodora, that others were subtle and crafty, and-

the Emperor, who honoured this Assembly with his? Presence, had exhorted²
them to lay afide all· their Differences‚ and to enter into Measures of Union
and Peace, instead oi applying themselves to the VVork for which they were
convened‚ they began shamefully to accuse each other before him, and raised
great Disturbances in the Council by their mutual Charges and Reproaches.
Soc· E. H· Sabinus, also, saith they were generally a Set of very ignorant Men, and desti-

cedonian Sect, probably his Testimony may be thought exceptionable3 and
even supposing his Charge to be true, yet Socrates brings them off by telling us,
that they were enlighten'd by God, and the Grace ot his Holy Spirit, and so
could not possibly err from the Truth. But as some Men may poffibly que-
stion the ‘l'ruth of their Inspiration‚ so I think it appears but too plain, that
an Affembly of Men, who met together with such different Views, were so
greatly prejudicecl and infiamed against each other, and are allowed, many of
them, to be ignorant, till they received miraculous Illnminations from God,
did not seem very likely to heal the Differences of the Church, or to examine
with that Wisdom, Care and Impartiality, or to enter into those Measures of
Condescenfion and Forbearance that were necessary to lay a solid foundation

for Peace and Unity.
However, the Emperor brought them at last to some Temper, so that they
fell in good earnest to Crem-making, and drew up, and subscribed that, which:
from the Place where they were affembled was called the Nicene. By the Ac-
