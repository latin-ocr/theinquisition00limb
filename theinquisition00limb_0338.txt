fitor, who in Decency is bound to defend the Proceffes of his CommiffarieS.
He cannot however grant such Commiffary a Power of substituting a Vicat
sor himself, Sometimes they appoint two Commiffaries, who shall equally
and jointly proceed against the Guilty.
The inquisitor only can depose the Vicat thus appointed by himself, and
'tis not in the Power oi the Prelates of the Religious.
Sometimes the Pope himself appoints the Commiffary‚ so that there are
two forts of Commiffaries, some appointed by the Inquifitor‚ others by the
Pope. Their Power is unequal. The Commiffary appointed by the Inqui-
snor, neither takes Place of the Ordinary, nor poffeffes all the other Privileges ,
which the inquifitor doth. Whereas he who is particularly appointed by the
Papal Authority, is in all Things equal to the Inquifitor himself.
Cal-en. 'Tis a Question amongst the DoCkors, Whither upon the Death of the*-
p. με, 7. inquisitor, the Jurisdiftion of the Vicar ceases. But though this was con-
n· 152 16-troverted heretofore, there seems to be no Doubt remaining about it now.
For the Congregation of Cardinals Inquifitors General hath decreed, that the(
Vicars General of the Inquifitors shall be nominated or chosen by the Inquiff-
tots, and then confirmed by their Congregation. Whilst this Decree is int.
Force, the Vicars have their Jurisdiffion properly from the Congregation 3.
and therefore as Aets derive their Validity from the Person confirming them,
the Jurisdifflon of the Vicars shall not- expire upon the Death or Removal
of the Inquisitors. And thus Carena tells us it was observed in the city Pa-
τίη, in which after the two Inquifitors that were dead, the Vicars General of
the holy Office managed all the Affairs of the Inquifition.
Ρ. 1.r.11. As to what regards the Vicars appointed in the several Cities, which they
Ψ· 5, 7· call F oraneous Vicars‚ they have seldom any Thing else granted to them, but
only the Management of an offenfive Process, as to which they are often to.-
inform the Inquifitor of the Transactions in reference to it. So that they can
imprison no Person, unless the Affair be first communicated to the Inquisitor,

p· 3- qu. are commanded by a Bul] of Clement IV. beginning, Ne Catholicae Fidei negotium,
³0⁰ that to remove all Difficulty, they shall take Care to affign to the several
Friars chosen for Inquifitors, their several Assistants, viz. Friars oftheir Or-
der, careful and discreet Persons, fit for the said Busmess, and who are wor-
thy to bejoined with those whom they are to affist. And as often as the In-

quifitors shall defire it, let them provide others of the same Order helisei?
