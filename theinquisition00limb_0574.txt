The HISTORY of the INQUISITIONss

Days, be cited again, and interrogated upon Oath‚ laying their Hand on the
Scriptures, whether they have any farther Truth to communicate besides
what they deposed in their former Examination. And whatsoever is the An-
swer, the Notary takes it from his Mouth.

Ifthere be Reason to apprehend from the Circuinstances of the Witness,
that he will discover the Cause‚ he is enjoined Silence‚ under the Penalty of
Excomrnunication, lntoesententioe, after a single Admonition, and other Pe-
nasties, at the Pleasure of the holy Office. Sometimes also, for just Rea-
sons, they take Care and command the Witness or Witneffes not to depart
from the Palace or House of the Inquifitor, without the express Leave of
the Inquisitor, written under his Hand.

After the same Manner all other Witneffes named by the Informer in his
Information, are examined.

But if the Informer be also a Partaker and Partner in the Crime, and when
informing against his heretical Companions, deposes nothing against himself,
and any Thing appears against him from the Examination of the Witnesses or
Accomplices, he is cited by the Inquisitor, and proceeded against as a Cri-
minal, but punished in a milder Manner, because of his having informed a·

ainst others.

g In the Examination of Witneffes, in many Places, there must be five Per-
sons present. The first is the Judge, τ’. e. the Inquifitor or his Commiffary,
whose Bufiness is to examine the VVitness'es and Persons accused, by forming
‚Articles and Interrogatories upon them. The second is the Witness. Every
one of these must first swear to speak the Truth‚ otherwise their Depofition
will be invalid, according to the Precept of the Council of Biterre, Cap. 4.
Give to all those, who being cited before you, appear within the, Time affigned them,
their Onna, to tell the entire and whole Truth concerning the Faff'c of heretical Pravi-
ty, which they know of thenifhlves, or of others, living or dead. The F orm of the
Oatli is commonly this: I sweczr by God and the Cross, and the four most holy
Gospels, now touched with my Hands, that Iwillfioeak the ‘T ruth. If I do, so help
me God ·, z'fI do not, so God condemn me. The third Person is the Writer, who
writes down the Interrogatories ofthe Inquifitor, and the Answers of the Person
accused, and the WitnesS. He must be a publick Person, viz. a Notary that
-hath Authority, either a Layman or Clergymzm, or a Religious. But when the
Inquisitor cannot have such a publick Person, or Notary, he may chuse two

thority in Writing. The fourth and fifth Persons are two whopaffist the In-
quisitor, and are Witnesses to the whole Examinaffion, and they must be
two disci-eet Men, religious‚ or otherwise reputable. But when the Inquifitor
cannot conveniently have these two Persons present at the whole Examination
ofthe VVitness or Person informed against, he must, at least, have them at the
End ofthe Deposition, when the Depos1tion is read over by the Notary to the
WVitness that depol‘e5‚ or the Informer, in the Presence of the Inquisitor, and
¹the two aforesaid discreet -Persons, and then the Witness is asked if he stands
