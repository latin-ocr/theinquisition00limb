from the Opinions of Calvin on this Article, and was in a few Months after
warmly opposed by Gomarus his Collegue‚ who held, That 'twas appointed by
an eternal Decree ofG0d‚ who amongs‘i Mankz'nd shall he saved, and who shall be
damned. This was indeed the Sentiment of most of the Clergy of the United
Provinces‚ who therefore endeavoured to run down Arminius and his D0&rine
with the greatest Zeal‚ in their private Conversations‚ publick Disputes, and
-in their very Sermons to their Congregations‚ charging him with Innovations,
and of being a Follower of the ancient heretical Monk Pelagius 3 whereas the
Government was more inclinable to Arminius's Scheme, as being less rigid in
its Nature, and more intelligible by the People‚ and endeavoured all they
could to prevent these Differences of the Clergy from breaking out into an
open Qarreh to the Disturbance of the publick Peace. But the Ministers of
the Psedestinarian Party would enter into no Treaty for Peace : The Remon-
strants were the Obje&s of their furious Zeal‚ whom they called Mamalukes,
Devils‚ and Plagms, animating the Magistrates to extirpate and destroy thern,
and crying out from the Pulpits‚ We must go through thick and thiu, withoutfear-
ing to stick in the Mire: [Vc know what Elijah dicito Baal's Priests, And when
the Time drew near for the Eleftion of new Magistrates‚ they prayed to God
for such Men, as would he zealous even to Blood, though it were to eost the whole
‘Trade of'their Cities. They also accused thern of keeping up a Correspondence
with the Jesuits and Spaniards, and of a Defign to betray their Country to
them.

These Proceedings gave great Disturbance to the Magistrates‚ especially
as many of the Clergy took great Liberties with thern, furioussy inveighing
against thern in the'rr Sermons as Enemies to the Church‚ and Persecutors ; as
Libertines and Free-Thinkers‚ who hated the fincere Ministers ofGod, and
endeavoured to turn them out of their Office. This Conduct, together with
their obstinate Refusal of all Measures of Accommodation‚ and Peace with
the Remonstrants‚ so incensed the Magzstrates, that in several Cities they
suspended some of the warmest and most seditious of them, and prohibited
them from the publick Exercises of their ministeria] Functiom particularly
Gezelius of lfflerdam, and afterwards Rosoem, Minister at the lingue, for endea-
vouring to make a Schism in the Church‚ and exhorting the People to break
off Communion with their Brethren. Being thus distarded, they assumed to
themselves the Narne of the persecuted Church, and met together in private
Houses‚ absolutely refusing all Communion with the Remonstrant Ministers
a}r¹1d Party‚ in spite of all the Attempts made use of to reconcile and unite
t em.

What the Ministers of the Contraremonstrant Party aim-ed at, was the hold-
-ing a national Council, which at length, after a long Oppofition, was agreed
to in the Affembly of the States Genera, who appointed ΒΜ* for the Pi ue of
the Meeting. Prince Maurice of Orange, the Stadholder, effeffitually pref-ared
Matters for holding the said Affernbly ·,and as he declared himselfopnly for the
