Tr. tr. As to the Heirs of penitent Hereticks‚ there is a Decree of the Council of
fol. 417· Biterre, determining what they are obliged to. You ought to require a fititable
Satisfaltion from the Heirs of ficch, who having confeſjed and being reconciled, have
died without-Penance, that so great a Crime, publickly confeffed in Judgment, may
not go unpuniJhed in any. Let the same be done to those who having received Pe-
nance, have died without performing it, or delay’d to do it, or who have obliged
,themselves to fulfil it, under Forfeiture of their Effebts, or who have been command-
ed to transport themfhlves. Alexander IV. in his Consultations agrees with this,
⁴saying, Μονεουεν, some, as you add, have bound themselves to the Inquisitors‚ un-
der Foifeiture of all their Effetts, to receive Penance from them, and fulfil it for
their heretical Offences, who, after being enjoined it, have died without perforining
it, or rather having negtened it wholly, or in part. ’T is therefore asked, Whether
the Inquisitors themselves, or those who sttcceed them, may force the Heirs or the
‘Poffiffors of the Goods of fitchdeceased Perfhns, to make Satisfabtion for them?
’ΤΟ which we answer‚ ‘That if by such Penance‚ an Obligation profitable to Salva-
tion, shall have been laid, for which the temporal E eets are to be answerable‚ the In-
quzfitors may force the Heirs to fulfil it, or such other Persons to whom the Effebls
{nay come under such Obligation. But they can 'oy no Means be forced to under-
go those personal Punishments that Hereticks themselves must suffer if they
seturn. Hence Guido Fulcodius, in his Consultations, answers, ‘1' hat he believes
such as are absolved by the Inquisttors, and die before they have performed their Pe-
¹nance, are reservedfor Purgatory‚ and that nothing farther is to be laid upon their
Heirs. Alexander IV. also answers: There are others also who have confeffed
in Judgment their Heress, before the Inquzfitors of heretical Pravity, and died be-
fore they have been enjoined Penance. We ans-coer, T hat inasmuch as they did not die
Hereticks‚ but rather incorporated into the Unity of the Choreb, we do not see that Sa-
tisfallz'on for a Crime extinet is to be required from them after Death, or from their
Heirs who fitcceed to their Estate. But in the Case where Heirs are not admitted
to inherit for the Fault of their Predeceffors, if Death should happen between the Sen-
tence declat-ed, and the Confiscation of their Effelin such Confiscation musttake
place aster Death, notwithstanding it did not whilst the Criminals lived.
napa& 2. Zanchinus explains these Things more distinetly and hriefly. ‘⁶ A three-
“ sold Punishment descends to the Children ofa Person condemned as an He·
“ retick. The first is the Forfeiture of Effeets‚ because they are absolutely
“ deprived of paterna} Succeffion. The second is, their Incapacity to succeed
“ any of their Relations, or other Persons whatsoever‚ either by Will or
‘j without onet sshe third, their Inability to enjoy any Ecclefiastical Bene-
