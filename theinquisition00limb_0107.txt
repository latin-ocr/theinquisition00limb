Conversation very unblameable. But as these Sacrifices were unacceptable to
the, People, the King preferred, that Hereticks hereaster, though condemn’d,

amose others with the Solemn ty osa publick Execution.

In the Reign of the Royal Martyr, the Church was in the Height of he? Charies L
-Glory and Power 3 though such is the Fare of all human Thirigs, that she
soon ficken'd, lingum-red, and died. Laud carried aii before him, and ruled
the chum-‘11 with a Rod of Iron ·, and though he seems to have had too much
Pride to submit to the Pope of Rome, he acted the Part ofa Pope himself, al-
lowing himself, as Heylin tells us, to be addreffed under the Tities oFHolinqxff,
and most loo-ly Ezzher. The Things he seemed principally to have had at
Hears, were the introducing an arbitr-ary Government into the State, the Sup-
preffion and Exsirpation of Nenconformity, and bringing the Church of Eli-g-
land, in Rites and Ceremonieffi to as near a Resernblance as posfibly ᾖε could,
to the Church of Rome. This appears, by his protecting fistulaeque, Manwa-
ring and Sibchorp, who had infe. moussy preach'd up the King's absolute Power,
and making the two forn-:er Bishops ofthe Church3 by his persecuting [ᾖε Puri-
t-an Ministers in the Star-Chamber and High Commiffion Courr, who, as
Heylin tells us, Laud used to say, were as bad as the Papists, imprisoning and
fining, and forcing many others to take Sanctuary in New Engz⁷aml3 by his put-
ting down and filencing all Leeturers throughout the several Dioceses of the
Kingdorn, by his suspending and ejeffing such as refused to read the Book of
Sports, by his forcing the French and Dutch Churches to a Conformity with
the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of England‚ by his obliging [ᾖε Scots
to 'receive Episcopacy, a L'turgy and canons, by his forming new Articles
and ecclefiastical Constitutione, for the Eng'ish Clergy, and enjoining thern a
stri& Oar'n for the preventing of all Innovations ς by the many Popish Super-
stitions ᾖε introduced into [ᾖε publici< &Vorssiiffi such as Altam, Tapers‚
Candles, Candleflicks, Copes, HoodS, Images, Pietures, Cringes, Bows‚
Consecrations, and the like, and by the Lenity that was shewn throughout the
whole of his Administration to the Papists themselves, whilst many worthy
and learned Protestant Gentlemen and Divines were treated with the -utmost
Indignity and Barbarity ς some ofthem dying in Goal, and others befng made
to undergo the most cruel bodily Punishments, for daring to oppose the arbi-
tsary and superstitious Proceedings of this furious and relentless Prelate. No
Man of Compasfion can read his Treatment of Dr. Leighton without being
shocked and moved in the same render Manner as the House of Commons
were, who several Times interrupted, by their Tea-rs, the reading of the
Doctor's Petition ·, which I shall here present rny Reader with entire, and leave
him to form what Character he pleases of the Man, that could contrive *and
carry on such a Scene of barbarous and execrable Cruelty.
