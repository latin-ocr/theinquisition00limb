 

The Iernooucrmx,

Whereas, in Truth, Subscriptions are the great Securities of such profligate
*tvl-esche& who, by complying with them, enter into the Chinch, andthere-v
by share in all the temporal Advantages of it,· whilst the scrupulons‚ consci-
entious Christian is the only one she excludes, who thinks the XVord of God
a more sure Rule of raith than the Dictates of Men ; and that Subscriptions
are Things much too sacred to be trifled with, or lightly submitted to,

They are indeed very great Snares to many Perseus, and Temptations to*
them too often to trespass upon the Rules of stri& Honesty and Virtue. For
when Mens Subfistence and Advantages in the World depend on their subscri·
bing to certain Articles of Faich, 'tis one of the most powerful Arguments
that can be, to engage thern to comply with it‘ 'Tis poffible indeed they
may have their Objecffions against the Reasonableness and Truth of what:
they are to subscribe· But will not Interest often lead them to overlook
their Difficulties‚ to explain away the natural Meaning of VVords‚ to puta
different Sense upon the Articles than what they will fairly bear, to take them
in any Seme, and to subscribe them in no Sense only as Articles of Peace ?
It must be by some such Evasions that Ariam- subscribe to Athanafian Creeds‚
and Arminian.. to principles of rigid Cal-vinism, Tnis the Clergy have been
again and aer-*nn reproach’d with, even by the Enemies of Christianity.
And 1 am sorry to say it, they have not been able to wipe off the Scandal·
from themselves. Iam far from saying or believing that all the Clergy make
these evasive subscriptions : These only that do so give this Offence3 and if
they are, in other Cales, Men of Integrity and Conscience, they are Ob·-
jefiks of great Compasfion· As far as my own Judgmens. is concerned‚ I think
this Manner of Subscribing to Creeds and Articles- of Faith, is infamous*
in its Nature, and vindicable upon no Principles of Conscience and Honour.
It tends to render the Clergy contemptible in the Eyes os the People‚ who will-
be apt to think that they have but little Reason to regard the Sermons of Men,
who have prevaricated in their Subscriptions, and that they preach for the same
Reason only that they subscribed‚ viz„ their worldly Interest. 'sis of very
pernicious Influence and Example, and in its Consequences leads to the
Breach of 311· Ρ3ἰι1ι amongst Mankind, and tends to the ‘subm-flou of civil
Society. Foris the Clergy are known to prevaricate in subscribing to religi-
ous Tests of Orthodoxy‚ is it not to be fear'd that others may learn from them
ro prevaricate in their Subscriptions to civil Tesss of Loyalty ? And indeed,
there is a great· deal of Reason to imagine, that if Men can tutor and twiss:
their Consciences so as to subscribe Articles of Faith‚ contrary to their own
Persuafion‚ and only as Articles of Peace, or a Qpalification for a Living,
they would subscribe for the same Reason to Popery or Mahometanism 3 for
if this be a good Reason for subscribing any Articles which I do not believe,
’tis a Reason· for subscribing all; and therefore I humbly apprehend that a
Praffioe, which gives so much Occafion to such scandalous Prevarications«
with God and Man, should be cast off as an insufferable Grievanoe, and-
ἓε an Yoak upon the Necks of the Clergy, too heavy for them to

ear.
