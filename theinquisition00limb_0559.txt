The H1sronr of the INmQUISITION 129

In several Inquifitions' tis customary to publiffi such Εάἰᾶε for the Discove— Pe egna
ry of Hereticks every Year, the second Sunday in Lent, in the Cathedralprax dq-
Church during the Celebration of Mass, and therefore on that Day there is nol Μ’ ¹ '
Sermon, that all may more attentively regard the Things contained in that§ ’ ⁷⁷ 5·
Edi& of the Faith. This Method of Inquifition is prescribed by the Coun-
cil of Tholouse, cap. 2 We ordain that the Arch- Bifhops shall oblig e hy Oa h one
Prstst, and two or three, or more, if Need he, of the Laity, of good R epulation, 777

frequently zcnqz cire out Hereticles 777 the fizid Parifhes, by searching eveJy Houst’, and

A special Inquisltion is a certain Right of proceeding by Office to Con-
demnation and Punishment against certain Persons inquifited by Name, defa-
med for particular Crimes, to which the Judge cannot proceed without pre·
ceding Infamy, which supplies the Place of an Accuser. However, in the
Crime of Heresy, the Inquifitor may a& upon Signs and probable Suspicions,
where there is no preceding Infamy, and even where he ls not sure of the Bo·
dy of the Offence, because Heresy is a Crime thatleaves no Traces after it
But 1n this Case he rnust proceed cautioussy, and very privately, that no Per-
son' s Reputation and Honour may be injured.
But ofthese three Methods of Proceeding, the first, by way of Accusa- ξ 3.· n.6·
tion, is not used·, the second, by F ormatmn altho' common and usual,

Treason against the Divine Majesty, to the Judg 3 of the Faith, they begin

'to inquire and to proceed, and in this whole Affair the Inquisition claims to

it self what1s otherwise done chiefly by Witneffes. And therefore the Judges
are called Inquisltors, and the Tribunal and Ministers are said to be of the
gffucffitcignthe rnost holy Inquisltion, from this third Mechod of Proceeding by
