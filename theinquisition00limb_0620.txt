whether Cognizance hath been taken ofthe Crime either by Accusation or In-

'sl-iere is also another kind of Defenoe, viz. when any Person confeffes some

self to be clear of Heresy‚ because Heresy consists properly in the Mind.
When this Defence is urged, the Criminals are tortured to discover their In-
tention‚ and to make them fully and entirely consess. But this they limit in
certain Cales, and don’t proceed to the Torture to find out the Intention‚
if there be no considerable Proof ofthe Crime besides the Criminal's Confes-
lion, and when there isjust Ground to conclude by the Circumstances of the

of this decided before the Tribunal of the holy Office at Granada, by Francis
Marin de Rodezno, Inquisitor at Granada.
In the Year 1640. Apr. 5. on Thursdczy in the Week before Easter, there was
a VVriting fixed upon the Gates of the Senatehouse at Granada. In this Paper
the Law os Moses was greatly extolled, and the Se& of Calvin commended,
and the most holy Faith of Christ accursed with the most terrible Impreca-
tions. The Virginity and Chastity of the Mother of God was denied in so
very obscene a Manner, as would scarce become a common Whore prostitu-
[ἕως her selfin a Bawdy-house. He also, with a Shew of Compaffion‚ advi-
sed all Persons, that they would not thoughtlessly suffer themselves to be
drawn away by a false Religion. And finally he threatned‚ that he would
cause to be destroyed all those Regards of Worship and Piety, which the
City of Granadcz payed to a marble Image of the Virgin, erafted as a Token
‚of Victory, and placed in an open Field over-against the Gate of Elvira, at
the Entrance into the City, and commonly called, Our Lady of wiumph. This
W riting was seen by two Men after the Dead of N ight was over, by Twilight‚
and as the Paper and CharaCter was very extraordinary‚ it easily excited their
curiosity, and altho’ they were ignorant of the ContentS, they took it down
from the Gares. But aster they had read it, and perceived the Wickedness and
Blasphemy of it„ they carried it the next Day to the sacred Tribunal of the
Inquifition. The Report of this Wickedness immediately took Air, and the
Enormity and Greatness of the Crime alarmed the whole City os Granada.
One F riar Francis Alexander was appointed by the Senate of Granczda, to
take Care of the Worship of the said Lady of Triumph, who, upon this Ac-
count, wa8‚ aster the Spamjsh Custorn, called, The Hermit‚ and whose Habit
was very agreeable to his Office. He pretended to his Neighbours that he
-was injured above all others by this Offence done against the Mother of God,
andin his private conversation in the City oftentlmes inveighed against the
Heinousness of the Crime, and at last deposed in a legal Manner what he had
Reason to suspetft, and what he himself had observed in that sacred Night.
But as nothing came of the most diligent Inquisitions that had been made
