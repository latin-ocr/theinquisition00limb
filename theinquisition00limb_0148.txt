The INTRonuc‘rION}

they &hiemi-ned,- Aa Commiffion of :the same imporr· with that which he {ave
them before, Man. xviii. 18· [Vbntffiever yefhall balad on Earth, fhczll be bound in
Heaven3 and wlmtfhe-ver ye shall loos} on Earth, fhcle be loofhd in Heaven. To
bini-l, is to retain Mens Sin53 and to losse, is to 222mit their Sim And this
Power the Apostles had ς 3ηά it was absolutely necessary they {hou-ld have it,
'or they could never have spread his Religion in ihe World. But wherein
did this binding andloofing, this retaining and remitting Sins, confist? What,
in* their saying to this Man, Iabsolve you fiam your Sins; and to the
other, 1 put you under the Sentence of Damnati-ca? Would any confiderate
Man in the World have ever credited their Pretfflfions to suen an extrava-
gant Power? Or can one fingle Instance be produced of the Apostles pre·
tending to 'exerci-se it? No· Their Power of binding and loofing‚ ofretaining
and remitting Sins consisted in this, and in this principally‚ viz. their fixing the
great Condicions of Mens future Salvation‚ and denouncing theWrath of Al—
mighty'Gnd against all, wh0, thro³ wilful ODstinacy, :would notbelieve and
obey the Gospel. And the Conimiffion was given them in the most general
Terms, Whose fhever Sinsye retain, δίο. not because they were to go·to parti-
cular «persons, and ,speremptorily say, Tou shall be saved, and you shall he
a'amneass but because they were to preach the Gospel to Gentiler, as well as
Jews, and to fix those Conditions of future Happiness and Misery, that

. should conclude all the Nations of vhe Earth‚ to whom the Gospel should

be preached. This was their proper Office and work, as Apostles; and,
in order to this, they had the Spirit given them, to bring all Things that
Christ had said to their Remembrance, and to instrue& them >fully in the
‘Nature and Doctrines of³the Gospel. And as they have declared the whole
Counsel ofGod to the world, they have loosed and bound all Mankind,
even the very Brfhops and Pastors of the -Clmrch, as ‘well as others, as they have
fixed those Conditions of Pardon and Mercy, of future Happiness and Mi-
sery for all Men, from which God will 'not recede, to the End of Time.
This was a Power fit to be entrusted with Men under the Condu& of an
unerri'ng‘Spirit, and with them only; whereas the common Notion of sacer·
dotal or priestly Absolution, as it hath no Foundation in this Commiffion to
the Apostles, nior in any Paffage of the sacred Writings‚ is irrational and
absurd‚ and which the ‘Prie'sts have no more Power to give, than any other
co‘mmonChristian whatsoever, no, nor than they have to makea new Gospel.
·1 ‘would add, that as the Apostles received thissscommiffion from Christ,
they were bound to confine themselveswholly to it, and not to exceed *the
Limits of it. ,They were his·Servants who sent them, and the'Meffage they
'received from him, that, and that only, were they‘to deliver to the World.
