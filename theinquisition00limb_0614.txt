“ (fisis, as the more equitable, who determines, that two VVitneffes only are „

“ not sufficient to prove the Crime of Heresy, but that three or more are re-
“' quilite, unless the Person accused be one of an ill character or Reputa‘tion,
“ and there be other Circumstances concurring against him, in which Case
‘⁶ the common Opinions of the Doffors may be followed.

“ However, 'tis the Judgment of most, that the Custom observed in re-
“ producing the VVitneffes, and examining them in full Judgment before the
“ Inqnifitor and two religious Persons, according to Cap. ut officium, ᾗ. verum.
‘³ de haeret. l. 6. δε 1742‘31·2152.T02et.c. 14. abundantly supplies the other Dese&
“ ofnot exhibiting the Names ofthe Witnefi'es, when their Evidence is given
‘⁴ in. But in my judgment: they are greatly mistaken3 because this Omiffion
“ is in an essenti-al Point of Law, and the Custom of examining before these
“ religious Persons is, as Experience teaches‚ of little or no Effeet. For ’tis
‘⁵ too common with the Generality to persist in what they affirm or deny,
“ whether true or false, and they think it Advantage enough to have their

Since therefore they are so exceeding cautious not to discover by any
Means the Informers or Witneffes to the Criminals, 'tis evident they are not
brought before, or confronted with one another, that they may be heard

teaches us, that Persons are seldom confronted in the holy Office, and that
'tis never done in the suprearn Tribunalof the City, unless the Cause be sul-
ly known, and the Cardinals supream Inquifitors interpose by their De-
cree, who usually determine, whether or no any Danger may accrue to
the Witneffes and Crimina] by being confronted. But because sometimes
it happens in the holy Office, that the Criminal must necessarily be seen
and pointed out by the Witnefl‘es, this is done not by openly confronting
them, but by making the Witnesses look through the Crevices of the Door
of some f'astened Room, where the Criminal is put, in Company of some other
Persons alike in their DresS, Stature, and Face. This Carena says was
practised formerly in the Inquifition at Cremona, according to the Command
of the sacred Congregation, where a certain Regular, who had contracted
Matrimony, was thus viewed and pointed out, notwithstanding his Confes-
sion, tharhhe Sentence of the Nullity of his Marriage-might be more safely
