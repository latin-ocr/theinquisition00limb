by the sharp Husk of the Reed‚ in pulling it from him. The Wound was
far from being mortal, or from endangering the Loss of any Part, and so
could not deserve a severe Punishment. 'Twas no more than a Scratch of
the Skin‚ a mere childiffl Wound, as one may imagine by the Cause of it.
However, the Inquifitor’s Boy came to his Master, who was walking
near the Place, to complain about his Wmmd, upon which the Inquifitor‘
orders the Gardener to be taken up, and thrown into the Inquifitory Jayl‚
and kept him there for nine Months in very heavy Irons, by which he recei-
ved such Damage in his Circumstances‚ which were at best but mean, as the
poor Man could not easily recover3 his Children and wife, in the mean while,
being ready to perish for Hunger. And all because he did not pay Defe-
rence enough to the Inquisitor's Boy, as a Member of the holy Tribunal. At
:nine Months End they dismiffed him from Jayl, and would have persuaded

C H A P. XI,
Of Persom suspebffed qf HERESY.

Dm& Lthough‚ in other Cases‚ ’tis usual to distinguish between a Suspicion
part, 2. Α and aPresumption, aSuspicion being no other than a. Man's Opinion
Q. 55, concerning a Crime, several of which Suspicions must concur to form a Pre-
¹²56· sumption of it, yet in the Cause of Heresy they are-taken for the same. A
Presumption or Suspicion therefore in this Affair is, a probable Guess of a
doubtful Matter, proceeding from the Nature of the Thing, or the Circum-

ἃς· §- ¹7· and the Manners of those with whom he converses. This is the Reason that
the Inquisitors‚ in their first Examinations‚ so diligently ask the criminals of

what Nati0n‚ Couutry‚ Family and Kindred they are, amongst whom they

have been educated, who were their Masters, Instructors‚ Companions and
Friends‚ For these Things‚ and a thousand other such are usually confider-

edin doubtful Cases, that from hence they may draw more probable Proofs,

They also confider the Sex. A Man may more easily be presumed guilty

of Robbery. A Woman of Witchcraft. And farther‚ they consider· the.

Age, Fortune, Difference of Condition‚ Nature of Minci, and InclinationS.

In the Cause ol Heresy Suspicion is threefold; Light‚ Vehement and
*Violent : A light Suspicion is that which arises from the external Sigus os‘v

Actions and Words, by which such a Guess may be made, as may imply,

not indeed frequently, but seldom, and by Accident, that he who says or

does such Things is an Heretick„ This is inferred by a small Consequencez
