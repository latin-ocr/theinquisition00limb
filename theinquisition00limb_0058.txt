peror, by many Bishops and Clergymen, who declared themselves Orthodox‚
of being the Author of all the Seditions and Disturbances in the Church, by
excluding great Mtiltitudes from the publick services of it ·‚ of muithering
some, putting others in Chains, punishing others with Stripes and VVhippings,

‚and ol burning Churches? And is the Enemies ofAthanafies endeavoured to

ruin him by suborned Witneffes and false Accusation5‚ Athanasius himself used
the same Praffices to destroy his Adversaries, and particularly Eusebius of Ni-
comedia, by spiriting up a woman to charge Eusebius with getting her with
Child, the Falshood of which was detected at the Council osTyre. His very
Ordination also to the Bithop of Alexandria, was censured as clandestine and
illegal. These Things being reported to Constantine, he ordered a Synod to
meet at Caesarea in Palestine, of which Place Eusebius Pamphilus was Bishop,
before whom Athaimfius refused to appear. But aster the Council was remo·
ved to ‘Tyre he was obliged by force to come thither, and commanded to an-
swer to the several Crimes objected against him. Some os them he cleared him-
self of, and as to others he defired more Time for his Vindication. At length,
after many Seslions, both his Accusers, and the Multitude who were present in
the Council, demanded his Depofition as an Impostor, a violent Man, and un-
worthy the Priesthood. Upon this Athanastus fied from the Synod, aster
which they condemned him, and deprived him of his Bishoprick, and ordered
he should never more enter Alexandria, to prevent his exciting Tumults and
Seditions, They also wrote to all the Bishops to have no Communion with
him, as one convieted of many Crimes‚ and as having convieted himself by his

ι ssight of many others, to which he had not answered. And sor this their Pro-

cedure they affigned these Reasons, that he despised the Emperor’s Orders, by
not coming to Coesarea ; that he came with a great Number of Persons to Tyre,
and excited Tumults and Disturbances in the Council‚ sometimes refusing to
answer to the Crimes objected against him, at other Times reviling all the Bi-
ihops; sometimes not obeying their Summons, and at others refusing to sub·
mit to their Judgment; that he was fully and evidently convieted of break.-
