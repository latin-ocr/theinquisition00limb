The two Emperors, Valemiuianus and Valens, who succeeded Joviczu, were
of very different Tempers, and embraced different Parties in Religion. TheSoc· l· 4·
former was ofthe Orthodox fide ; and though he lavoured 111016 most who werec· 1·
of his own Sentiments, yet 116 gave no Disturbance to the Arians. On the
contrary, Valens, his Brother, was ofa rigid and sanguinary Disposition, and
severely persecuted all who differed frorn 111111. 111 the beginning ostheir Reign Theod.
a Synod met in Illyricum, who again decreed the Consubstantiality of Father, ¹· 4· c. 8.
Son, and Holy Ghost. This the two Emperors declared in a Letter their As,C0d.
sent to, and ordered that this Dofh‘ine should be preached. However, theyTi'ss'i‘gd]

Coullczutinoplc, to forsake both his Principles of Religion and Moderation, and Ξ ⁶⁶1 6
embraeing the Arian Pax-ty, he cruelly persecuted all those who were of thes? ' ⁰
orthodoxParty. The conclu& of the orthodox Synod met at Lampstzcus was
the first Thing that enraged him3 for having obtained of him leave to meet,
for the Amendment and Settlernent of the Faith, after two Mont'ns Consulta-
tion they decreed the D0&rine of 1116 Son’s being like the Father as to his Es-
sence‚ to be Orthodox, and deposed all the Bishops of the Arian Party. This
highly exasperated Valens, who thereupon called a Council of Arian Bffhops,
and commanded the Bishops that composed the Council at Lampsacus to ern-
brace the Opinions of Eudoxias the Arian, and upon their refusal immediately
sent them into Banilhment, and* gave their Churches to their Enemies, sparing
only Paulinus, for the remarkable Sanetity of his Life. After this he enter’d
into more violent Measures, and caused the Orthodox, some of them to be
whipped‚ others 10 be disgraced, others 10 be imprisoned, and others to be
fined. He also put great Numbers to death, and particularly caused eighty ofSoc. {bili

In the mean Time great Disturbances happened at Rome, Liberius, Bishopsoc. 1. 4·
of that City being dead, Urfiuus, a Deacon of that Churc'n', and Damasus,0·²9·
were both nominated to succeed him. The Party of Damasus prevailed, and
got him chosen and ordained. Urstuus being enraged that Damasus was prefer·
red before him, set up separate Meedngs, and at last procured himself to be
privately ordained by certain obleure Bishops. This occasioned great Dil'putes
amongst the Citize'ns, which lhould obtain the Episcopal Dignity, and the Matter
was carried to such an Height, that great Numbers were murthered in the Qar—
