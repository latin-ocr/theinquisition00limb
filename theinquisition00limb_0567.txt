The Hlsromr ofthe INQUISITION· ¹325

“ happens, as we said before, thro’ the Disposal of God‚ bringing this Good
“ out of another’s Wiekedness, that one Man shall not discover another whom
“ he knew to be an Heretick, during their F riendship. But upon [110 asi-
“ sing of some Enmity between them afterwards, he immediately goes to the
“ lnquifitor, and now denounces against the Person whom he hath long known
‘¹‘ to be an Heretick, and says that he doth it thro’ a Zeal for the Faith, and
“ with a Regard to Charity, altho' poffibly heis induced to it by the Influ-
“ enee of Hatred. Therefore the Inquifitor ought diligently to attend to the
“ Quality of the Deponents or Denouncers, and very exaffly and cautioussy
“ make Inquifition concerning the Truth of the Things attested and said, and
“ well to remark the Words of the Chapter, In Fidei favorem, de haeret.
“ lib. 6. viz. Whether or no those who thus testify may be presumed not to
“ speak Falsehood, from likely Conjeftures, and the Number of the VVitnes-
‘⁶ ses, or the Quality os the Persons, as well those who depose, as those who
f‘ are deposed against, and from other Circumstances.''

But 'tis quite otherwise as to Witneffes themselves, for an Enemy is not ad-
mitted as a Witness. Not that every sort of Enmity preventa a Person from
being a Witness, but mortal Enmity only. Thus the Council of Eidem-e de-
termines, Cap. 13. and that of Narbonne, Cap. 25. Such Exceptions only
fhall wholly destroy the Credit of the W'itneffi’s, which seem to proceed not
from a Zeal for Justice, hut from the Instigation of Malice‚ viz. (Σωτίωνα-
cies and mortal Enmities. For although other Crimes weaken, they do dot set
aſsde the Evidence, especially if the Wlmffis have amended their Fault.

So that, according to this Decree, several Crimes do indeed leffen theffimaneg
Credit of the Evidence, but do not wholly render the Persons incapable of be· t. 64·
ing Witneffes. In like manner every sort of Enmity doth indeed somewhats- 79,80,.ss
weaken the Weight of the Evidence, but don't entirely overthrow it,

unless it be mortal Enmity.

The Causes by which we are tojudge of mortal Enmity are various, and de- Peon. {a
termined by the Spanish Law. If any one hath killed, or endeavoured, orpf} com.
even threatned to kill the Kinsman of that Person against whom he would116·
bear Witness, if he hath laid Snares for his Life, or accused him of aCrime,
which, if proved, would be punissied with Death, Loss of a Member, Ba-
nishment, „or the Forfeiture of all, or the greatest Part of his Estate. To
these Pegna adds some other Things, which, however, are not determined bbiid.
that Law, viz. if any one deposes against him in a criminal Cause3 or if the
Party accused hath at any time put his Accuser in Chains 3 or even if he hath
spoken very reproachtully of him, viz. ifhe hath called him Cuckold, or his
Wife a Whore ·, or called a sober Man a Drunkard, &a In these Cases,
however, he says the Circumstances of the Persons‚ reproaching each other,
should be considered 3 as whether they are vile and infamous Persons, who
have little Regard to their Honour, and are given to reproachful Language,
and so eafily forget what they say3 or whether they are noble, and well
born: Belides this, the Custom of the Provinces and Cities are also to be re-

garded. Farther, he says that mortal Enmity may arist: from one Mqss's
