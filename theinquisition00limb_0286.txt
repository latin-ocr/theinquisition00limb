Bzovius, Itherto the Kingdom of Valence had no particular Inquifitor of the Faith. ¹

4· ¹4¹9· The Inquisitor at Roses in catalonia exercised the Holy Office in that

θ’ ²0· Kingdorn by his Vicars and Commifl‘aries, so that they could not make so
large a Progress in converting the Jews and Moors, of whom great Numbers
lived there. And therefore Pope Martia, at the Request of King Alphonsus‚
by Letters dated at Florence, Apr. Cal. 6. 1419. decreed, that the Office of
the Inquifition in the KIngdom of Valence‚ ihould, for the future, be governed
and administer’d, without any Impediment, not by Comn‘iiffaries and Vicars,
but by an Inquisitor deputed by the Prior, to whom that Affair belongs, who is
to refide there personally himself, and act as Principal.

Boxhorm- About the Year 1460. the Inquifition raged cruelly in Flanders and Artois,

1¹²st- 1³5²& against certain Persons, who were falssy accused of Magick, and being in League

{32:1⁶3ss with the Devil, who, to render the Valdenses odious‚ were called Valdenstes,
bom. de and the Place in which they were said to have their nightly Meetings, Valdffa.
Beauvoir· At Doway, Arras, and other Places, many of them were thrown into Pri-
son at several Times, at the Demand of Peter Bruffizrd, Inquifitor, where be-
ing overcome with Torments, they confeffed every thing they were charged
with, and, amongst other Things, that they had given themselves to the
Devil, adored him, and known him carnally, and other incredible Things of
the same kind. When they were condemned to the F ire, they protested thern·
selves innocent, and publickly declared with a lond Voice that they never were
in Valdefia, as they called the Place of this nightly Meeting of Witches and
Devils ; but that they were deceived by their Judges, who by fair Promises of
saving their Lives and Estates‚ if they would confess the Crimes objected to
thern, drew from them a false Confeffion of Crimes they were never guilty of,
Others said, that they extorted a false Confeffion from them by Torments,
finally beseeching the By—standers to pray for thern to God, to whom they
committed their Souls in the Midst of the F lames. But their Innocence after-
wards appeared 3 for in the Year 1491. these miserable Creatures, with others
thrown into Prison on the same Account, were declared innocent by the Sen-
tence of the Parliament of Paris, and had their Effeets *restored to them, and

their unrighteous Judges were severely fined.
