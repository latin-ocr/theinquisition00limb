⁶³58 The HisToRY os the INQmstTmN:

:ind Tongue, that they every where observe uniformly the same Manner in
every Thing, in the Denial of their Faith‚ Baptism‚ God, the bleffed Vir-
gin, trampling on the Cross, and Promise of Obefflence, by turning the left
Hand behind their Back, and that this appears by the Confessions of all of
them made before the Inquisitors, every where throughout Italy, and by the
written Proceffes formed against them. That this Consormity argues they
:tre not deluded by Dreams, because these would vary as to Time and Place,
according to the Variety of Cwses, and'the Qality of Persons.

Thev add, That these Persons have been seen and known by several Ca-
tholick‘PeoplQ as they have‘been going t0‚ or returning from these Assem-
blieS. Yea‚ that some who have been carried by the Devil to some distant
Phce, have, God so ordering it, been let down, and then found themselves
ata great Distance from their own Country. And farther, when these
Witches consess before the Inquifitors, and are converted to the Bosom osche».
Church, abjuring their Heresy and Apostacy, they never after return to their
Play3 which could not be, if these Things were presented to them only in ·
Dreams or Imaginations‚ because Dreams are not in the Power of Men. To
which they add as a Concluslon, That many osthese Persons have for many
Years past been delivered over by the Inquifitors of heretical Prav2ty' to the
secular Arm, and burnt3 which would never have been done, nor suffered
by the Popes‚ unless these Things did really happen, and they were found to
be in this Heresy and Apostacy.

And although it may sometimes happen that these Things may appear to
them only in Dreams and Fancy, and that they are not really carried to this
Play, being found at Home at the same time they thought themselves pre·-
sent at it, they think it doth not at all follow from hence, that they are never
corporally carried through the Air. And indeed although they never should
have been so carried, yet because after they have been thus deluded by
Dreams, they do not only firmly believe that they did these Things when
they are awake‚ and in their SenseS, but do confirm and approve them, and
strongly believe that they have denied the Catholick Faith‚ adored the De-
vil as God3 and do take him sor their God, and that by doIng so, they do not
sin, but do well, and persevere in all these Things before the lnquifitors‚
they therefore think thern truly Hereticks‚ Idolaters and Apostates 3 because
those who believe these Things do depart from the Faith.

Ι have no Inclination to spend any great Time or Labour in examining and
refuting these Things, and enquiring what Truth there is in such Accounts,
and whether some Parts of them may· not be admitted as true, whilst others
ought to be rejected as fabulou33 nor how far credulous, fearful and super-2
stitious Persons may be deluded by vain Imaginations and Dreams, and what
may be truly performed by Devils. Others have done this abundantly, and
the doing it is foreign to my History. And therefore I refer my Reader to

‘simol ἶ 3 Simon Ej2qs20pius, who hath very learnedly and solidly treated of this Matter.
