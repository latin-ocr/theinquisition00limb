“ to take place in Inquifitions and Visitations carried on against Judges anfi

“ their Ministers. For they are placed as a Mark to be ihot at, and are not

“ capable of pleafing all, because they are bound by Office daily to repri-

“ mand many engaged in Law-Suits to imprison them, banish them, fine,

ξ( condemn, and sometimes punish ‘them with Death.’'

But ifany one now should presume‚ without a manifest Neceffity, and un- Comv 124.

‘neffes, AccuserS, or Informers‚ he would afr, according to Pegna's lvsind, very ΠΜ·
imprudently, and, for what he knows, fall into mortal Sin ; because he would
a& against so many Decrees of Popes, and against the received Custom of

the holy Office, which, though not supported by any Law‚ yet being a corn-

* mendable, approved, and legally prescribed Custom, hath the Force of a
Law.

And tho’ the Criminal infists, and demands, that he be allowed to make

his Defence, according to the Course of the Law‚ and by Consequence that
the Names ofthe Witneffes be shewn him as well as their Depofitions, he is
not to be heard. T hose who are called new Christians in Spain, never could
obtain it, tho' they used their utrnost Endeavours for it. Ludovicus a Para-l 2. ts Ξ,

dinaszd, the new Converts offered 800000 Pieces of Gold to the King‚ if he
would order the Witnesses to be made known in the Tribunal of the Inquifition·
And when the young King‚ who was but 18 Years old, was greatly tempted by
so vast a Sum of Money, Cardinal Ximenes, Inquifitor General, by setting be-
fore him the great Danger of such Witneffes, and the Damage that would
hereby accrue to the Church, wrought upon him to despise that Offer.

But when the Person accused cannot particularly defend himself upon ac-

count of the s uppreffing the Names of the WitneffeS‚ but can only conjecture

he may know, whether the said Deponents and Witneffes are the mortal E-
nemies of the Persons accused or not.
, Eymerick, in the third Part of his Direffory of the Inquifitor3‚ describes to
us fix Ways of giving a Copy of the Process to Persons accused of Heresy, sup-
preffing the Names of the Accusers, by which 'tis evident‚ that this one
Thing is determined by the Inquifitors, viz. to condemn the Prisoners as
guilty, right or wrong, by ufing various Arts and Impostures‚ and especially
by denying thern the principal Means of their Defence.

The first Method is, to exhibit the Names of the Informers, not in the 119 &seq
Copy of the Process, but in a separate Paper, nor in the Order in which they
depose; but in such aManner as that he who is the first Informer in the
Copy, shall be the fixth or seventh in the separate Paper·‚ that by thus

chang‘mg the Order of the NameS‚ the Person accused may not know what
every one deposes.
