“Pem- diCtion, tho’ not lawfully, because they sin in doing it·‚ and they give this
Reason, because the Power of any Order consists in an indelible Chara&er
Hence they infer, that he who hatli once legally received this Power must af.
ways keep it, and that therefore he may validly do an act, which do'th notre-
quire jurisdiction, provided the due Matter‚ Form and Intention be preser-

mitted by any one, to the Nomination and Appointment of the Apostolick
See·, whereas the Receivers, Favourers and Defenders of Hereticks are not

tick, his Son and Daughter‚ and Grandson by his Son, is judged incapable
but the Grandson by the Daughter is not incapable‚ because he is reckoned o}

his own Father's Family. Isthe Mother be an Heretick, the Son or Dauoh-

ter only in the first Degree is incapable‚ and no farther. The Sons of tffose
also suspected of Heresy are incapable. But when the Receivers and Abettons of
Hereticks and the like are dead, there can be no Process against them, because

their Crime is extinguished by Death. As for those Children who accuse their
heretical Parents to the Judges of the Faith‚ the Punishments appointed by

Law don't affe& them.

Amongst the Ecclesiastical Punishments is also reckoned‚ that no Offering

is to be made for those who die in Heresy, nor are they to receive Christian

Burial. Cap. Sicut ait B. Leo de haeret. And this Innocent IV. especially or-
