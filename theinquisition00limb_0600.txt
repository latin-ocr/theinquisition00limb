C H A Ρ. XVIII.

How the Interrogatories gt‘veal in hbybshde CR1 M 1NALs are formed
an ex z tte .

N Order to prepare his Defence‚ the Criminal also puts in his Interroga-
tories, and desires of the Inquifitor that the Witneffes may be interroga-
ted upon them. But if they are impertInent, or deceitful, or tending to dis-
cover the Informers, or to intangle and puzzle the Witness‚ or to conceal the
Truth, or to discover such Circumstances by which he might come to the
Knowledge of the Informer or Witneffes, the Inquifitor harh Power to set
them afide.

'Cathol- But as Simancas tells us, this is not the Method in the Spaaifh Inquisitions,where
Instit. the Criminals are not allowed to put Interrogatories to the &Vitnefl'es of the
²·⁶4·⁷¹·¹0·Pr0motor of the Exchequer, but the Judge is obliged by Office diligently to
examine into the Credit, Life and Manners ol the Witneffes. But the contra-
ry is observed in all the Inquifitions in Italy, as Carena informs us, and that it
P· 3· t. 7· ought to be thus, he proves by this Reason. ‘That by notgiving the Names ofthe
§⁸¹⁸ Witneffes, the Defence of the criminals at this Tribunal is imperfeb? and maimed
enough, without introducing any other Novelty ·‚ but that the Dey‘ences of the Cri-
minal would be neceffarily much more imperfeffc' aad maimeass if the thff’s against

him should not be suffered to he interrogated by him.
Pegna‚ In Italy 'tis usual for the Criminals Advocate‚ to demand that the Witnes-
λὶς· 3¹'ses rnay be examined and interrogated, concerning their Country, Age,
Condition, State, Employment. As, whether he is rich or poor, Clergy-
man or Layman, a Religious‚ Regular or Secular, married or unmarried,
a Father or a Son ? Whether he be a Citizen or Inhabitant ofthat City
where the Cause is carried on? When he came to the Place? Whether
he always lived in it? Whether he lives at his own or other Person’s
Charge? Whether in no Trial or Case he never deposed upon Oath Things
which were not true, either for or against any Person? whether he was ever
excommunicated, and on what Account, and in what Place? Whether he,
or his Parents, were not declared infamous‚ interdicted‚ excommunicated,
and incapable to bear VVitness? Whetlier he confeffed his Sins this Year at
Easter, to what Confeffor, andin what Church? Likewise whether he hath
taken the Sacrament of the Eucharist, from what Priest, and whom present?
Whether he was ever under Inquifition, accused or proceffed, for any Crime
or Crimes, what they were? Whether he was absolved or condemned, and by
wha t Judge? Whether any Thing was said, promised, forgiven, or granted
