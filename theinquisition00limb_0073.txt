 

The INTRODUCTION.

Ac'ts of that Council were falfified by his Enemies, asecondSynod of the
neighbouring Bifhops rnet ‘m the same City‚ who, after examining those Acts,
found them to be genuine, and confirmed the Sentence against Eutyches. Bur
Dioscorus, Bishop of Alexandria, who was at Enmity with Flavian of Constan-
tinople, obtained, from Theodofius, thara third Council should be held on this
Affam which accordingly met at Ephefiw, which the Orthodox stigmatised
by the Name of Ans-emm, the thieving Council, or Council of Thieves. Dios-
corus was Prefident of it, and, after an Examination of the Affair os Eutyches,
his Sentence of Excornrnunication and Deposition was taken off, and himselfre-
stored to his Office and Dignity, the Bishops of Constantinople, Antioch, and
others, being deposed in his stead. But the condemned Bishops‚ and the Le-
gates from Rome, appealed from this Sentence to another Council, and pre-

ferved for his Successor Marcion ς and· when the Fathers, in Obedience to his
Summons, were convened at Chalcedon, the Emperor favoured them with his
Presence ·, and, in a Speech to them, told them, That he had nothing more atHeart
than to preſservethe true and orthodox Christian Faith, safe and uncorrupted, and that
therefore he propost’d to thern a Law, that no one should clare to dispute of the Person of
Christ, otherwise than as it had been deternzined by the Council of Nice. After this
Address of the Emperor, the Fathers proceeded to their synodical Bufiness,
and, notwithstanding the Synod was divided, some of the Fathers pioussy cry-
ing out, Damn Dioscorus, banish Dioscorus, banish the AEgyptian, banish the
Heretick, Christ hath deposed Dioscorus ·, others, on the contrary, Restore
Dioscorus to the Council, restore Dioscorus to his Churches ς yet, through the
Authority of the Legates of Rome, Dioftorus was deposed for his Contempt of
the sacred Canons, and for his Contumacy towards the holy universal Synod.
After thiS, they proceeded to settle the Faith according to the Nicene Creed‚
the Opinions of the Fathers, and the Doetrine of Athanasius, Cyrill‚ Caelestine,
Hilarius, Bafil, Gregory‚ and Leo; and decreed, that Christ was truly God,
and truly Man, considistantial to the Father as to his Deity, and consubstantial to us
as to his Humanity, and that he was to be confcff’d as confisting eyfitwo Natures with-
out Mixture‚ Converfion of one into the other, and without Division or Separation ;
and that it should not be latcfulfor any Persons to utter‚ or write, or compoſse, or
think, or teach any other Faith whatsoever ; and that if any should presume to
doit, they should, if Bishops or Clergymen, be deposed3 and if Monks or
Laicks, be anathematised. This procured a loud Acclamation : God btess the
Emperor, God bleſs the Empress. We believe as Pope Leo doth. Damn the Divi-
ders and the Confounclers. We believe as Cyrill did: Imnzortal be the Name of
cyrill. Thus the Orthodox believe ·, and cursed be every one that doth not believe

so too. Mareian ratified their Decrees, and banished Dioscorus, and put forth an Evag, kz.

Edist, containing very severe Penalties against the Eutychians and Apollina-

rists, commanding that no one whatsoever, either of the Clergy or Laity,1n
should publickly dispute about Religion, under Pain of Banishment, and ,50
