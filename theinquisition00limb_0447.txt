 

The HisTomc ofthe INQUISITION. 17

‘⁶ Execution might be granted against him, even without a declaratory Seu„
‘⁶ tence, altho’ there are some who inslst upon the Neceffity of a declaratory’
“ Sente-nce even in notorious Crimes, and think that no Execution can be
“ granted without ·it.''

This Confiscation ofGoods is so rigidly infisted on, that there is no posfible
way of evading it, no not by the Alienation of a Man's Effeets. The Tre&
sury of the Inquisition devours all. Thus we read, that amongst other Condi-
tions of Peace prescribed to Raymona' Earl of Tholouste, these were some.

N. 1 1 . Likewz'se we ordain, that whereas we have understood that the Believers of Bzovius,
Hereticks, who intend to become perseo? Hereticks, according to their detestable Life, «ιλιι-δα
fell before-hand their Poffeffions and Inheritances, to defraud the Treasury, or give or §- ⁶0
conveythem, or by other Meam alienate them, those Contrabls shall be all void, and
the aforesaid Goods shall be confiscated, is all Circunzstances of the said ContrabJs and
Contratlors considered, it shall appear to us that they were fraudulently made.

N. 12. Furthermore, whereas we have understood that certain Hereticks remove
to other Hereticks‚ under the Pretence of Merchandz'ze or Travelling, that by such Ab-

Jence they may defiaud the Treasury, and convey away their Goods‚ we ordain, that the
Bishop of the Place shall admonish and require their Relations, or such who have their
Goods in Poffiffivn, to affign some Just and reasonable Cause of their continued Absence,
and ²f they do not affign such C ause within aYear, to be computed from the Time of the Ad„
¹ monition given byfitch Bishop, that then, if such absent Persons are otherwise sttspeited,
they shall be presumed Heretick5‚ and all their Goods confiscated. But if they, or their
Heirs, or thoſse who poffeſs their Goods‚ shall affign any Just or probable Caufie of such
their Absence beyond the aforesaid Time, either after or before the Confiscation of their
Goods‚ that then such Goods may be lawfully left in their Poffeffion, or restored to

ἢ them,

 

Ἰ The same Things as are prescribed in these Condicions to the Earl of Tho-

louse, are observed in Italy, by the Pope's Command, that by no Pretence of
, Alienation there may be any Poffibility ofescaping the Confiscat'ton of Goods‚
or Forfeiture of Dominion. Lucas Waddingus relates in his Annals, that Friara. 1260)
Andre-cv, Inquifitor in Tuscany, proceeded to seize a certain power'ful Heretick, §- 5,&c‚
called Capellus de Chia. The Pope commanded, that all the Faithfu1‚ both
Ecclesiastico] and Secular, should grant their Affistance, that they should
muster an Army against him, and proceed in an hostile Manner to waste and
destroy his Lands. Capellus, knowing himself proscribed, made a pretended Sale
of the Castle of Casal. Peter James Surdus, a Citizen of Rome, obtained from the
Senatots of the City an Order, that the Inhabitants of Viterbo, who had ta-
ken Arms in Obedience to the Church and the Inquifitors, should not attack it,
falsely pretending that it belonged to him. The Pope chid him severely, ad-
ding these amongst other Words. We therefore will, and by these Prcsentsstrifftly
command you, that as spon as ever you receive them, and as you regard the divine Fa—
vour and ours, you defifl from fi> impious and pernicious an Undertaking, as the De-
fence of the said Cafile, and that you don't enter it by any Means whatsoever3 but
that you do procare, that the Inhibition given thro’ your Instigation by the aforesaid

86νέιὲίὲνὶ of1 IViterbO, be totally revoked. Othssrwistr we will have you to know, (mZZZ
