of the. Fau, viz. who embraces and profeffes that Doehine: And laffiy,
the pronouncing the Sentence. The first is acknowledged to belong to the
ls.cclefiastical Court ·, [116 two latter they contend belong to the Secular, and
was always formerly administred by Seculars, during [116 Roman Empire.
Anci though sometimes, by the Indulgence of PrinceS, the two last were al-
lowed to the Ecclesiasticks, yet the Senate of Venice never gave up that Antho-
rity, but always order’d their DeputieS, and in other Cities ostheir Territories,
the Magistrate, to be present at all Afflons of the InquifitorS. And so great
is their *CI-aurion, that 1f any one hath any Commerce with the Court of Rome,
he cannot affist at forming the Proceffes. The proper Bufiness of these As—
¹sistants is, only to be present3 and if any Thing doubtful occurs, to inform
the Prince3 and therefore they make no Promise of Secrecy to the Inquisi-
tors, but are obliged to let the Prince know what is done in the Inquifition.
Yea, although one of the Clergy, of the same Order with the Inquifitor
himself, be accused before the Inquisition, the Civil Magistrate must be pre-
sent, nor suffer the Inquisitor to proceed, unless he be with him, even after
the Injunffion made. And although the Inquisitor will communicate the
whole Processto him, he must nevertheless be present at it: And if the
Ecclesiasticks should form the Process whilst the Civil Magistrate is absent,
he will command it to be resumed before him, even although the Process
be carried on without the Venetiam Territories. The Senate hath especially
taken Care that neither the Process, nor the Persons taken up ssiall be sent
out of their Dominions, unless by the Advice and Consent of the Prince.
That this Method is observed in the Inquifition at Venice, Father Paul proves
by a plain Example, in his History of the Venetian Inquisition. An. 1596.
One Lewis Peli-accim Senensts, was thrown into Prison at Padua. And where-
aS, according to the usual Custom of the inquisition, the Roman Inquisi-
tor ought tro have sent to Padua, the Fasts and Proofs which he had
against him ·‚ he on the contrary demanded that the Prisoner should be sent to
him3 and urged this Matter at Rome to the Venetiam Ambaffidor, and at
Venice by the Pope’s Nuncio : But the Senate made Answer, That it was
not proper that that laudable Institution of the Republick should be altered,
which orders the Prisoners to be tried in those Places where they are taken up
and confined3 but that it was just, and agreeable to the receiv’d Custom,
that whatever Crimes the Prisoner was accused of should be transmitted
to the Inquisitor at Padua, that so he might suffer the just Punishment of his
Crime. And they thought this so evident and manifest a Piece ofJustice‚ that
no Body could oppose it, This Affair was controverted on both Sides by
many. Letters for five whole Years, Petruccius being all the while kept in
Prison. But at length the Romans finding they could not get the Prisoner
into [11611 Poffession, wrote, An. 1601. to the Inquisltor at Padua, to dis·
miss his Prisoner Petruceius 3 which created no small Suspicion what Sort of
Crime it must be, which they had rather should go unpunilhed than discover
it to the Inquisitor at Padua-
