The HISTORY of the [NQUISITION. ¹³³3*ss

Dezcz at that Time Genera] Inquifitor ofSpain‚ sent thither in the Year 1504,
Peter Balforatm, Archbilhop of Affeffilm, with the Power of inquisitor. Fer-
dinand gave him Letters to the Governor, Nobles, and University ofNaplm,
that they should give him all Assistance and Favour. He tells them that a
great Number of Hereticks, having fied from the Kingdoms ofSpain, through
Fear ofthe holy Office of the Inquifition, had sheltered themselves there asin
a Place of Safety, who had been burn’d in Effigy because of their Absence·,
and that therefore, to purge that Kingdom from the Crime of Heresy, he had
appointed Peter Balforatus, Inquifitor of heretical Pravity z He therefore com-
mands them to receive him as such, to give him in all Things the Assistance of
the secular Arm, and not to suffer him, or any of his Family to be molested,>
But as there arose many Difficu‘lties and Discouragements, he could not finish
his Undertakin .

In the Year t(iz-47. Charles V. being Emperor, Peter of Toledo, Viceroy of
Naples, endeavour’d to introduce the Inquifition there, by the Command of
Charles. But as he apprehended this would be a difficult Thing, he put those
into the publick Offices, who he thought would be most forward to promote
it. After this he publickly declared, That it would greatly tend to the Esta- Hist. cm·
blilhment of Divine VVorship, would be serviceable to- the Commonwealth,T›·2d· l· 32*
and be highly grateful to the Emperor3 if after the Example of the- Spa-P· 313,
niards and Siciliam they would receive the holy Office. But the Neapolitans {1¹2¹ss
were so moved with the Novelty of the Thing, that they pubnckiy declama asti-b. Ξ,
that they would rather loose their Lives than submit to the Inquifition ; and

understood thisn, he declared by his Apostolick Bull, That the Inquifition
against Hereticks belonged to him and his Judges, and not to any other. The
King indeed would have had the Inquifition at Naples to be subje& to the su-
preme Council of the Spanifh Inquifition, as were those of Sicily, Sardinia, and
the Indie53 whereas the Court of Rome would have had it subject to them,
because not only the Ecclesiastical but Secular GOvernment of the Kingdom
of Naples is under the Pope. However the Viceroy, that he might not seem
to yield to popular F ury, appointed, Inquisitors and Officials of the-holy Of-
fice3 with which the Neapolitans were so enraged, that. onna certain Dayx,

, when two Persons were leading, to’Prison, and cryingout they were taken up

by the Inquifition, they broke into open Sedition‚ ran-immediately to Arms,

ἶ and bound themselves by mutual Oaths, insomuch that: there was a Civil war,-
ζ between the Citizens of Naples, and the Spanifh Gari-ison, in which many on

both Sides were ssain. At length the Spaniards, who held the Fortreffes, pre-
vailing, and beating down their Houses with their great Guns, the Tumult
was appeased, and the Principal were punilh'd, Part with Death, and Part
with Banissiment‚ However, the Viceroy gave over the Attempt of introdu- Pam,

sion of the Pope and Cardinals, who opposed the Inquifition‚ as not being [nqm's. n»-
