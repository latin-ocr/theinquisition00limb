say a Falshood, thro’ Affection, Hatred‚ Fear, Money, or Entreaty‚ This
Sentence is to be declared to the Criminal, who may appeal from it, and af-
ter his Appeal the Cause must be referred to the Council, except the Apneal
appears to be frivolous. In such a Case the Inquisitors must not allow its as
it is in general appointed by Clement IV. and in particular by a certain Letter
of the Council of the holy inquisition.

Isthere be no Appeal from the Sentence‚ or is the Sentence be confirm’d
after the Appeal, or if it be rejeffitcd as frivolous by the InquilitorS, the Cri·
minal, in order to purge himself, must name so many good Men, for expur-
gatory VVitneffes, as are mentioned in the Sentence of the Inquisitors. These
VVitneffes must be separately cited before the Inquisitors‚ and askcd these three
Things. 1. Whether they know the Criminal, and how long? 2. Whether
the Criminal‚ or his Relaffions, or Kindred, have given and promised any
Thing to them the said Witneffes, that they should favour the Criminal?
3. Whether they have offered themselves to purge the Criminal? After this
they are all called to the Place where the Inquifitors give Audience, and the
Crimina] is brought to the Tribunal‚ and interrogated by the Inquifitors,
whether he knows those Men, and whether they are the Persons which he
hath named for his expurgatory Witnesses? He usually answers that he knows
them, and that they are the same which he nominated. These Things are
done before the Inquifitors only, and a Secretary or Notary‚ who commits
every Thing to Writing3 nor must any one be permitted to be present at
this Purgation‚ no, not the Vicar of the ordinary Bishop, as is contained in
a certain Letter of the Council of the Inquifition. However‚ the Ordinary
or his Vicar must not be excluded when the Sentence of Purgation is given.
Then the Inquifitor turns himself to the Expurgators‚ and speaks to them in
this manner. Know γε, Βνεῑῖανεη, that the Criminal N. is accused andsigffoefffed
of this and that Crime, on which account he is obliged to purge himſsff from this
Suspicion, and you are named as Witneffes of his Inuoceuce. And you N. ouscoer hyp, 514³
God and the holy Gospels, whether thou host committed those Crimes ἒ Having thus
been sworn upon the Cross and the holy Gospels of God‚ to declare the Truth,
the Inquifitors say to him, Thou N. host been accused of such aud sstch a Crime,
specifying those Crimes only which favour of Heresy, ofwhich thou art vehe-
mentlysuspeffed upon Confiderotion of the Merits of the Process, and therefore we
demand of you, upon the Oath you have taken, whether you have committed, or {lone
l or believed these Crimes, or any one of them ,Ρ And when he harh given his An-
swer in the Presence of his Compurgators, he is carried back to Prison.
Then the Inquifitor interrogates the Purgators, whether they have rightly
understood all these Things? Who answer thar they have. After this the
Witneffes withdraw, and being each separately called in, the inquisitor de-
mands of them, upon a solemn Oath‚ whether they believe N. hath sworn
true or false? And whatever they answer, must be faithfully written down by
the Notary. All these Matters are almost to a Word contained in one of the
Seville Instruffions, Au. 1500. Cap. 4. Formerly also, if a Person was pub-
lickly deIfIamed for Heresy, he was injoined canonical Purgation publzcklly,
