The Venetiam Senate hath also been particularly careful that the Inquisitors
ffiall not have the Power of prohibiting Books, because they may easily
abuse it t'o the Detriment of the Commonwealth·⁹ for they ostentimes for-
bid or adulterate good Books, and usesul to the Publick; sometimes they

ro’hibit Books which have no Relation to their Affairs 3 and sometimes be-
{ause they arrogate to themselves the Censure of all Books, they hinder the
Civil Magistrate from prohibiting and condemning Books highly injurious to

overnment.

ώῖῗιῗηῃ these Things and others, which might be mentioned from Father
Paul, but which for Brevity Ι omit, 'tis evident that the Venetiam Inquifition
is not so absolutely subject to the Pope as the other Italian Inquisitions are ;
and that it is not entirely committed to Ecclefiasticlzs, but that the Civil
Magistrate hath a principal Share in the Management ofit. ’

[Thurinus relates the same of the Venetiam Inquisition, viz. That the Se- Hist. lib, ς.
nate, An. 1548. renewed the Edi& that had been first made, An. 1521. se-
veral Persons suspeeted as to their Religion, os being Sorcerers, and in a
League with the Devil‚ being put to the severest Torture, at the Defire of
the- Pope’s Legate in Brescitz ; but with this Caution‚ that Judgment should
not be committed only to the Inquifitors and Bishops, but that there should be
always present the Governors ofthe Places, and some Lawyers‚ who should
know and see the Depofitions ; that none in their Territories, under the Pre-
tence of Religion, might, through Injustice and Covetousness, be oppressed3
which Caution they observed afterwards, when the Dostrine of Luther took
deeper Footing, and do maintain even to this Day.]

The INQUISITION against the APoSToLICKS, TEMPLARS,
and others, &o

BOUT the Year of our Lord 1300. there was great Cruelty ex-
ercised upon certain Persons called Apostolicks, in Italy. Α They seem

to have been the Offspring of the Albigenses: Their Rise is thus described Dfrpef,
by Eymericus. In the Times of Honorius IV. Boniface VIII. Nz‘cholas IV. and inquis. p,
Clement V. about the Year of our Lord 1260. there appeared Gemmas Sagarelli, 2 ‘'1⁶'‘⁸ 12⁶
in the Bishoprick of Parma, and Dulcinus in that ofNovarcz. They gathered
a Congregation, which they called Apostles, wholived in Subjeffion to none ς
but affirmed that they peculiarly imitated the Apostles, and took on them
a certain new Habit of Religion. An. 1285. March, Ides 5, they were con-
demn’d by the Letters Patents of Honorius IV. beginning, Olim felicis recor-
dationis, and afterwards by Nicholas IV. An. 1290.
