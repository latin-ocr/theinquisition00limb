The HISToRY ofthe INQUISITIQN.

in Imitation of thoſse who were inflamed with Zeul to destroy the Writingsof the Ma„
nicheanS, and thofh of the impious Nestorius, and the hurdned Eutyches, und Dios-
corus their Futher and Protefftor .· So will you deprive of ull Hope those wh0
vainly trust in them. We therefore pray‚ most holy Futher, that you would put in
Execution that Sentence against Anthimu5‚ which is both God’s und yours, that so
alt Offence may he removed from these little ones, thut believe in the ΖΔΘΜ, and from
us all. The Monks also making the same Request, in the Conclufion give this
Reason for it : For this Conse we hove sent unto you to Rome, und have promised
and even midertuken for your deftred Return. We huve received these Promifi’s
from the most pious Emperor, that what you fhnll canonicully pronounce, he willpifflsty

’ emente, that all the World may be delivered from this present Distat-hence by them.

Agapetus had paffed his Sentence before this Request ofthe Bishops and Monks,
and condemned Anthimus, and pronounced, that as he had been expelled from
the Bishoprick ol Constantinople before, so he should now be banished from
*that of Trapezuntium, and degraded from every priestly Office and F unc‘tion.
But no sooner hud he received these Letters of the Bishops and Monks, hut he sent
to Justinian the Emperor, that he would bunish those whom he had condemned for
Hereticks. Baronius adds, then he had done these Things, und thus performed all
the Duties of his Office, the most holy Agapetus died, in order to receive his Reward
now his Work wus done .· As though it was such an heroick ACtion, to conclude
his Life with exciting the Emperor to persecute those whom he had condemn-
,ed for Hereticks, as merited the Reward ofeternal Salvation. After the Death
of Agapetus, the Monks renewed their bloody Petitions to the Emperor, and
beseech’d him that he would banish those whom Anacletus had condemned as
Hereticks ε For, say they, there is Reason to feur, most pious Emperor, lest for
our long Delay‚ that of the People of Israel should huppen to us, who have cimongst
us Men accursed from the Priesthood3 who (because they had in the Midst of them
Achan and Jonathan, who exposed themselves to u Curse, the one wilfully‚ the other
through Ignorance) were in Dunger of being entirely destroyed, though they knew not
that they had the accursed ‘Ihing amongst them. Destoise not therefore, O ye most
Christian Emperors‚ so great an Evil, hut be filled with Zeul to promote the Knowledge

spired with the noblest Zealfor God, you may hove a Part in ihi} World ns they had,
and bring all your Enemies under your Footstool 3 and that he may grant you hereafter,
with them, an eternal Kingdom, who huth promiftd, that he will give an hundred
sold here, and hereafter Life eternul. Not long after, Anthimus and his Followers
were condemned by the Council of Constantinople, through the Intrigues of
the Roman Legate33 and many Petitions were offered to the Emperor for
the Banishment of those the Synod had condemned as Hereticks 3 so that by
the cursed Solicitations of the Ecclefiasticks, he was even forced to consent to
their Persecution.
It must however be owned, that some of the Bishops were Enemies to Perse-
cution ·, and being of more moderate Sentiments‚ blamed those who defended
and encouraged it. Sulpitius Severus tells us: T hat Idacius and Ithacius foolishly
