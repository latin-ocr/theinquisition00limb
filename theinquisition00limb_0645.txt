Person of great Worth‚ ’tis necessary that this Fame should he either 0f
the whole City‚ or at least the greater Part of it. But if the Fa& is inton—
fiderable‚ and restrained to a certain Number of Persons‚ who most proba,
bly are acquainted with it, the Evidence of the major Part of them is enouoh
ιο prove the Fame. As if a Biffiop, living with his canons, should be ἑὲ.
famed for Fornication‚ such infamy will be sufficiently proved by the major
Part of those Canons. But if the Faft be very small, and the Person mean,
the major Part of his Neighbourhood is enough.

Of all these Things Pegmz gives us a distinet Account. In this Causam-esf.
the Crime is said to appear so far as to infliet the Torture, when there is anP- 3· com.
halffull Proof, 01· Proof sufficient sor the Torture. Of these Proofs there Ιῖῗζ
are several„ First, Inconfistency‚ not indeed of any kind, but such only asffis'fozs'ff'in
regards the main Substance of the Crime‚ and in a Matter which it can'tv0¹ce²'7'·9,e-
be presumed should be forgotten in so little a while, which is lest to the Judoetura,
to determine ·‚ and when the Criminal himself doth not appear to be very stii-
pid ancl forgetful. Secondly‚ when any one is found defamed for Heresy,
and'tis farther proved that there is a 'Witness against him who can testify
from his own Knowledge, or that there is one or more vehement or violent
Proofs. Thirdly, If there is one VVitness against him who can testify from
his own Knowledge, and at the same Time there is one ⁴or more vehement or
violent Proofs against him„ Or ifit be found that there are against him seve-

⁴ralvehement or violent Prooss of Heresy, without any Infamy‚ or Witness-

from his own Knowledge. But when these Proofs are vehement‚ or sufficient
for the Torture, is left to the Judge to determine.

However, the Inquifitors do sometimes shamefully abuse this· Liberty,.
and rashly proceed to the Torture of innocent persons, as will evidently ap-
pear by one instance, not to ment³on more, given us by Gonsalvius. ‘⁴ Atp.1810-
“ the same time almost they apprehended in the inquisition at Seville, a noble
“· Lady, Joan Soharquicz, the Wife of Francis Varquim, a very eminent Msam
“ and Lord of Hfguera, and Daug'nter of Peter Gmfia Xerefius, a wealthy
“ Citizen ol Seville. 'l he Occafion of her Imprisonment waS, that her Sister²
“ Mary Bohorquicz, a young Lady of eminent Piety‚ who was afterwards
“ burnt for her pious Confeffiom had declared in her Tormre, that lhe had
“ several times conversed with her Sister concerning her own Dostrine. When
·“ she was first imprisoned‚ she was about fix Monrhs gone with Child‚.
“ upon which Account she was not so straitly confined‚ nor used with that
‘⁵ Cruelty which the other Prisoners were treated with, ont of Regard to
“ the Infant she carried in her.> Eight Days after her Delivery they took the γ
“ Child from her, and on the fifteenth shut her close up, and made her under-
“ go the Fate oft-he other prisonem, and began to manage her Cause with
“ their usual Arts and Rigour. In so dreadful a Calamity she had only this
“ Comfort‚ that a certain pious young VVoman, who was afterwardsburnt
“ for her Religion by the Inquifitors, was allowed her for her Companion.
“ This young Creature- was, οη a certain Day, carried out to her 'sortus-e,
