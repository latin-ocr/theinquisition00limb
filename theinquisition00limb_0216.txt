The Htsromr ofthe INQmsn-ionss

⁶⁶ cancy of the See. Whereas it evidently and legally appears to υς, as

⁶⁶ well by the Inquisition made in general against all who are infected with

⁶⁶ heretical Pravity‚ and by the Publick Aets and Process of the said Inquisi-

⁶⁶ tion, as well as by thy Answers, and Affertions‚ and proper Confeffions

⁶⁶ made in Judgment, that you John Chauoat, Son of Peter Chauoat, of the

⁶⁶ V illage of Malsta, near Urgesetum, in the Diocese of Besancon, usually dwel-

⁶⁶ ling at Vienne in the Diocese of Aix, was long since taken up, and have been

‘⁶ found by Proces3‚ to be of the Se& and Heresy of those, who are called Val-

‘⁶ denfts‚ or poor Men of Lyons3 which Se& and Heresy the holy Roman

⁶⁶ Church hath many Years ago condemned as heretical‚ and hath persecuted

⁶⁶ and condemned the Followers and Profeffors of it as Hereticks ·, which Se&

‘⁶ thou hast held and maintained for nine Years past, participating and com-

‘⁶ municating with the Valdenst’s, knowing them to be such, by eating and

‘⁶ drinking according to their Manner, praying with them on your bended

‘⁶ Knees, by hearing their VVords and Preachings which they make in their

‘⁶ Conventicles to their BelieverS, and by receiving them in thy House, and

⁶⁶ also by often confeffing thy Sins to them, and humbly receiving from them

* Meliora· Β(
’ ‘ ⁷²· ⁶⁶ being apprehended, and at the Beginning, being judicially required,would’st
⁶⁶ not swear, but didst several Times refuse to abjure the said Se& and Heresy,
⁶⁶ affirming that you believed it to be good, and that the Followers of it were
⁶⁶ good Men, and might be saved in it. And finally, whereas you have feign-
⁶⁶ edly and falssy said with your Mouth, but not with your Heart, that you
⁶⁶ would depart from it, and abjure it, and hast in Word but not with the
⁶⁶ Heart ,iudicially abjured it; of which F eignedness and F alfhood, and the
‘⁶ Doubleness of thy Heart there is legal Proof, by those Things which you
⁶⁶ have plainly and fully since recognized, asserted and confeffed in Judgment.
⁶⁶ And farther, whereas you have manifested your Treachery after your
⁶⁶ feigned tho’ judicial Abjuration of the said Se& and Heresy, by having de·
‘⁶ nied, and still denying with an obstinate Mind‚ tho' oftentimes required in
⁶⁶ Judgment, to swear that you would speak the Truth, and dost as before,
‘⁶ and much more evidently, approve and commend the Errors and Herefies
‘⁶ of the said ὃεᾶ, and affertest‚ that the Followers of it are just and good
⁶⁶ Men·, and that the Prelates of the Roman Church‚ and the Inquifitors
‘⁶ of heretical Pravity, who persecute them, do unjustly and unrighteoussy‚

⁶⁶ whereas the erroneous Followers and profane Profeffors of the Se& and Hie-⁹-
⁶‘ resy of the Valdenses hold and affirm, that they are not subject to our Lord
⁶⁶ the Pope, or the Roman Pontiff, or to other Prelates of the Church of
-⁶⁶ Rome, because it unjustly persecutes and condemns them. Item, They
‘⁶ affert that they cannot be excommunicated by the saidRoman Pontiff and
‘⁶ PrelateS‚ and that no one of them is to be obey'd, when they order and
‘⁶ command the Followers and Profeffors of the said Se& to desert and ab·

Absolution and Penance, which they call the * Amendment ς and whereas.
