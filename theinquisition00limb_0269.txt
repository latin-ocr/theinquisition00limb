The Hrsromc ofthe INQtJtstTIoN. tot

c< November,· After-warde: on the 4th of the Nones of November, the said Pe-
“ ter, beingjudicially interrogated if he believed that the Lord the Pope could
ιι forbid, under the Pain of Excommunication‚ any Person to hold the said
‘⁶ Order of those that call themselves Apostles, which the before-named Ge-
“ rard Segarellz' is saidto have begun. Item, If he believed that they who afted
‘⁶ contrary to the ibresaid Inhibition of our Lord the Pope under Pain os Ex-
“ communication‚ did incur the Sentence of Excommunication ·, he answered,
‘⁶ that St. Gregory says, that if any one excommunicates another unjuffly, he
‘⁶ doth not excommunicate that Person, but condemns himself.

‘⁶ Being interrogated3 if he believed that the Pope, by reprobating and
⁶< condemning the Order of those that call themselves Apostles, and excom-
“ municatine them who will not forsake it, doth unjustly 3 he answered, that
“ he did believe that the Pope did unjustly and against God in so doing, be-
“ cause they who call themselves Apostles were approved of God the Father‚
“ and that God had done several Miracles for them, as he heard say, and be-
“ lieves to be true ·, and saids that he believed that the Inquisitors, and Reli-
“ gious and otherswho persecute those who hold the said Order of the Apostles,
‘⁶ do sin ·, and to prove this, alledged Words and Examples, according to his
“ own Understanding‚ and would not swear‚ saying he had sworn too much
“ already. Finally, the foresaid Peter being judicially required to abjure the
“ Se& and Order of those falseApostleS, refused to do it, saying, that if he
“ should swear, he should aet against his Constience, and perhaps not observe
‘⁶ what he had sworn to, and so should fin ; and persisted in his first Opini0n2
“ that God had absolutely prohibited swearing.

In the mean while, the Inquisition raged· with no less Cruelty againstthe Al- Thol. Ias.

louse. . The Penitent were condemned either to wear Croffes, or to perpetual
Imprisonment‚ and the Impenitent burnt without Mercy. v

At the same Timethe Order of the Templars was suppressed by the Com= ·
>mand of Pope Clement V. Philip the F air, -King of anoe, had accused this ’
Order of various Heresies andWickednesses be'fore Clement. And as it seemed
very hard utterly to abolilh so famous and rich· an Order, and which had done
suchrexcellent Service for the Defence of theFaith, their Cause was debated in
several National Councils. At last Clement held a General Council at Vienna,
where the Affair being throughly examined‚ they were condemned for various
²Herefies and abominable Crimen which-whether-they· were true, or whe-
ther the People envied them for their immense Riches‚ or whether King
Philip thirsted a‘fter them, 'tis not easily to be determined. Ἰ

After they had been thus condemned in the Council of Vienna, all that were Bzo-eius,
