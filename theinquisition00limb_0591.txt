-and that for this Reason they are often examined and interrogated. But in
Truth this Pretence of Mercy is used only for this End, that the Criminal,
vwho ifconviCted by two agreeing Witneffes, and still perfisting in the Nega„
tive, is sure to be condemned as a Negative without Mercy, and delivered
over to the secular Coun, may, through Fear of this horrible Punishmem‚
confess the Crime he is accused of, and so be reconciled as a Penitent‚ by
certain Penances laid on him by way ofPunishment, or delivered over as im*
penitent to the secular Courr, and burnt alive. But if he revokes his Con-
feffion when made, and be not legally and fully convieted by Witneffe8‚ he ig
most cruelly tortured, because by his own Confeffion he hath given Proof a·

As often as the Criminals or Witneffes are examined‚ either in their first Pegna‚
or after Audiences, when the Examination is ended, before they go from ⁰· 2²·
Audience‚ the Inquifitors order the Notary clearly and distinffly, to read over
to them their Depofitions‚ that so the Criminals or Witneffes may add, di-
minish, corrector change what they please, that, if there be any Mistake‚
it may be reffified, which otherwise scarce could be. For if after the Criminal
or Witness goes from Audience‚ or if at any Distance of Time after, they
would amend or alter what they have said, it would *not be allowed them.
And therefore the Notary‚ at the End of the Examination, writes down,
that the Depofition was read over to the Criminals or Witnefl'es‚ and adds
whatever either of them-added, diminiffied‚ alteredor amended·

If, befides the Deposition of the Informer, and the Witnesses named by cap, 2³}

'the Evidence may be more fully confirmed. This they particularly ob-
Yerve, when the Witneffes or Criminal name any other Persons in their
'Examination-on one Side or the other. If such Persons are present, the
inquisitor orders them to be called and interrogated. If they are absent,
and it be not safe or easy to come at them, he writes to the Inquifitor
or Bishop‚ in whose Diocese they are, that he should cite and interrogate
them privately‚ and find out the Truth‚ and to transmit the Matter to him

i *faithfully and secretly as he discovers it. Thus 'tiS determined by the Council

 

of Narbonne‚ Cap. 22. Yet so, that the other Inquisttors may nevertheleſs inquire
out what they are able to discover, and write *to those Inquzfitors in what Things
