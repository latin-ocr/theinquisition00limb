168 'The Hrs‘ronv os the INQUISITION.

Story is this: Father Ephraim having had an Invitation from some Englifh
Merchants, built a Church in the City of Madrespatan, which was near to the
City of St. Thomas. To this Place several of the Portuguese came from St.
‘Thomas’s‚ to have the Benefit of Ephraim’s Instruction. By this he incurred
the Hatred of the Portuguest’3 and upon some Disturbance that was raised,
Father Ephraim was called to St. Thomas to appease it, where he was seized
by the Officers of the Inquisltion‚ and carried to Goa, bound Hands and Feet,
and at Night coming from on Board the Ship, hurried into the Prison of the
Inquifition. All Men wondered that this Capucine should be brought Priso-
ner before the Tribunal of the Inquifition as an Heretick‚ who was known
to be a Person of great Probity and Zeal for the Roman Religion. Many were
concerned for his Delivery, and especially Friar Zenon of tue same Order,
who tried every Method to effe& it. When the News os his Imprisonment
came to Europe, Persons were very differently affected. His Brother the
Lord Chateau des Bois, solicited the Portugal Ambaffador at Paris, till he pre-
vailed with him to send Letters to his Portuguese Prfsjesty‚ to defire his pe*
remptory Orders to the Inquifitors at Goa, to diss-2222} Ephraim from his Pri--
son. The Pope also himself sent Letters to (ΞΜ, εοιῑῑηῑειῃάἱηὲ him >to be set
free, under the Penalty of Excommunication. The King also of Golconda,
who had a Friendship for him, because he had given him some Knowledge
of the Mathematicks, commanded the City of St. &Thomas to be besieged,
and to be put to F ire and Sword‚ unless Ephraim was immediately restored
to his Liberty. The Inquifitors not being able to surmount all these Dif-
ficulties, sent him Word that the Prison Gates were open, and that he might
have his Liberty when he pleased. But he would not leave his Jail‚ till he.
was brought out by a solemn Proceffion of the Ecclefiasticks of Goa. And
although there are many Instances of the like Injustice, yet they very
seldom publickly punish’d the Iniustice and Cruelty of the InquifitorS, least

their Autihority² which they would have always accounted sacred, should be
contemne .
