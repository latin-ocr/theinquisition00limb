his Escape, tho' they determine that they may omit the making any verba} Ci-
tation, and proceed immed1ately to apprehend him, yet sometimes such absent
Person is summoned to appear on a certain Day and Place, to answer to such
Matters whereofhe is accused. But because by such a Citation the Crimina} may
be induced to meditate his Escape, others advise, that no particular Cause should
be mention'd in this Citation, but that he should be only commanded in gene-
ral to appear before the Inquifitors‚ to inform them of certain Matters. Like-
wise the Inquifitor writes to the Reitor of the Choreb, to which the Criminal
is subje&, commanding him to summon the Crimina] before him to answer con·
cerning the Faitsh, and to declare the Truth of himself and others as to the
Crime of Here .

This seems toybe taken from the Council of Biterre, c. 3. Let the Clergy and
Laity of that Place, which the Citation belongs to, be called together by some Eccle-
fiastical Perfim, to whom you shall commit this Affair by your Letters Patents, who, in
§Token of his having received the C ommand, must add his S eal to the said Lenem, and
write back by his own Letters Patents, figned with his Seal, how, before whom, and
when he diseharged the Order given him.

If the absent Person be wholly out of the Jurisdiffion of the inquisitor, the
Inquifitor examines the Witneffes privately‚ that it may not come to the
Knowledge of the absent accused Person that Inquifition is made against hIm.
Then the Inquifitor sarther inquires, whether he will return into his Juris—
dietion ς if 'tis probable he will, he waits a Year or more for his Return. If
’tis probable he will not, but that he hath changed his Place of abode, ’tis at
the Pleasure of the Inquifitor either to require the Inquifitor or Diocesan,
whose JurisdiCtion the Criminal is under, to send him to him, or else to trans-
mit him the whole Process‚ that he may do what he thinks proper, In Portugal
Persons accused are never turned over to another Place, but punilhed in the
Distriet where they are taken, whether the Crimes and Informations against
the Criminals are sent by the Inquifitors ofother Distrifts,

But when any one knows that Inquifition is made against him, or is aCiually
imprisoned, and yet makes his Escape, to avoid the Hands of the Inquifitors,
he is said to be a Fugitive. In this Case the Inquifitor first inquires diligently,
and without Noise, to what Place he is fled, and where he hath concealed‘
himself 3 and if he finds out the Place, orders him to be taken up, and
sent back to him. If it be within his own Jurisdiffion, he may require the
temporalLord to apprehend him, and condust him within his Distriet. Yea,
he may require the same from any other Lord, whilst he hath him in Poffeffion.
If he be without his Jurisdifflon, he may nevertheless proceed against him,
and require the Inquifitor, in whose jurisdiction he is, to cause him to be ta-
ken up, and sent back to him, or send him his Process‚ that he may do what
Justice shall require. Thus the Council of Tholouse heretofore ordered, cap. 8„
We ordaz‘n offo, that any one may make Inquisition, and apprehensi Hereticks in ano-
ther’s Province, and let the Ballives of fitch Places be obliged to grant them Ajss
fistance and Favour 3 so that the Ballive of the King· may do thus in the Dominions
