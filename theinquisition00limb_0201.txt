Enjoyment, without gaining any eternal Bleffings. Blelsed he God, who by Fear hath
enred us of our Negligence‚ fh that thro' Terror we have enquired after, what in a
State of Security we should never have been careful to have known. Others fizy .·
We were afraid to enter thro' false Reports, which we could not know to he falle
unless we entered. Neither should we have entered, unless we had been forced.
Blffd be God, who hath taken away our Fear by the Rod, and given us to understand
how vain and lying the Reports are, which have been raifhd of his Church. Hence
we believe all thofi,² Things to be falſs’, which the Authors of this Heress, have razsed,
fince their Followers have spread much greater Falfhoods. Others say .· We thought
it stgnified nothing of whatever Party we were Christians. But bleffed be God,
who hath brought us from the Schism, and shewn us that 'tis agreeable to the one God,
that he should be worshipped in Unity. Should I therefore opposte my ΜΓ to my Col-
leagues in preventing Methods so gainful to the Lord‚ and thereby hinder the ga-
thering into the Sheepfold of Peaee, where there is one Flock and one Shepherd, the
stray’d Sheep of Christ, who now wander in the Mountains and Hills, ι’. e. in the
Swellings of their Pride ? Ought I to oppose such a Provision as this, for fear of your
lostng the ‘Things you call your own, whilst if you were free from Fear, you would
proscribe even Christ himself? Have you a Liberty of making Wills hy the Ro-
man Law, and ought you to destroy by infamous Charges the Wll delivered
by God to the Fathers, in which 'tis written, In thy Seed shall all Nations

be bleffed? Should you be allowed to make free Contrans in buying and filling,
and yet dare to divide among st your fi’lves what the betrayed Saviour bought for
us? Is it just that your Donations to others should be valia, and should not what
God hath given to his Children be firm, whom he hath called from the rising of the
Sun to the setting of it? Can it be unjust to banish you from the Land of your
Body, when you endeavour to banzfh Christ from the Kingdom of his Blood, from
Sea to Sea, and from the River to the utmost Bounds of the World ? No .· Let the
Kings of the Earth serve Christ, even by making Laws for Christ.

From these Words of Ausim, it appears clearer than the Light, that he

thought this Punishrnent just upon the Donatists and Rogatians, he adds τ T he
Terror of temporal Powers, when it oppost’s the T ruth, is a glorious T rial to the
Good and Refhlute, buta dangerous Temptation to the Weak. But when it inculcates the
Truth upon the Erroneous and Schismatical‚ to ingenuous Atinas it is an useful Admo-
nition‚ but to the Foolilh it proves an unprofitahle Afflittion. There is no Power
but what is of God, and he that refisteth the Power‚ refisteth the Ordinance
of God ε For Princes are not a Terror to them that do well, but to those who
do ill. Wilt thou not therefore sear the Power? Do well, and thou ssmlt
have Praise from it. For if the Power favouring the T ruth corree‘ts any one, he
who is made better by it hath Praise from it : Or if, in Oppofition to the Trath, it
rages against any one, he who is crowned Conqueror hath Praise from it. But assor
thee, thou dost not well that thou should'st not fear the Power. And to make this
