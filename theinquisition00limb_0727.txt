The H131-0RY ofthe lNQUISthoN.

'Oath‚ by which the King obliges himself to protect the Catholick Faith, to the

Extirpation of Herefies, and the Defence ofthe Inquisition. The Kino stand-
ing bare-headed, having on one Side of him the Constable of Castile,00r one
os the Grandees of Spain, who holds up the Sword of State, swears that he
will keep the Oath‚ which is publiekly read over to him, by one of the Mem-
bers ofthe Royal Council ·‚ and remains in the same Posture, till the supream
Inquifitor goes back to his Place. After this one of the Secretaries of the In-
quisition goes into a Desk, reads over the like Oath, and takes it from the
Council, and the whole Affembly. Then all the several Sentences are read
over, and the Solemnity sometimes lasts till nine a Clock in the Evening.

··In Rome and throughout all Italy, as ,far as Ι could gather from any Au·

thore, they do not observe such solemn Proceffions in Acts of Faith, or in the

Sermons concerning the Faith. But in what Manner the Sentences are there
pronounced, and how they are executed, may, in some measure, be gathered
from the two following Accounts.

zovz‘us tells us, thatin the Year 1498. there were discovered 230 Moors‚§. 32„

who had abjured the Christian Faith after their Expulfion from Spain. After
they had wandered about they came to Rome, where they were known,
informed against, thrown into Jayl, and at length being recovered to the
same Faith, were thus admitted into the Church by Pope Alexander. On
Sunday‚ July 29. as J. Bruchardwrites, who saw it, an high and large Scaffold
was built before the Portico of the great Church of St. Peter’s at Rome,
between that and another Portico, which is above the Steps of the Ascent
to the said Church. Upon this Scaffold were placed the 230 Moors to be re-
conciled. All these Persons being sat down on the Floor ofthe Scaffold, in their
usual Habit, and the most Reverend Fathers and Lords, the Lord Peter
Arch·Bishop of Regio, Governor ofthe City, John of Carthagena, Ambaffador
of the most serene the King and Qeen of Spain, Ofiavianus, Bishop of Ma-
remo, Referendary of our holy Lord the Pope, Dominicus Jacobatius, and
James Dragatius, Auditors of the Causes of the holy Apostolick Palace,

Master Paul of Moneglisz, in the Country of Genoua, a predicant, Master of ¹

the sacred Pa‘lace, and Master John of Malcone, of the Order of Minors,
DoCtors of Divinity, Penitentiaries of our aforesaid Lord the Pope, in the
said Church, for the Spanisb Nation‚ being seated as above in their proper
Places, and in their ordinary Habit3 a certain Master in Divinity, a Predi-
cant, madeaSermon concerning the Faith in the vulgar Italian, and against
the said Moors, who were all ofthe Spamfh Nation, and of whom one was a Pro·
feffed of the Order of St. Francis, whose Habit he publickly wore, whom,
and all the aforesaid Perseus, he accused of all their Errors, which he knew
concerning the Faith, and reproved and instrueted.· After the Sermon was
ended, the Moors asked Pardon, and defired Absolution. Then the Master
of the holy Palace admonished them in Latin faithfully to believe, and [ο
live well, and putthem in Mind of the Penance which they had deser-
