eat any Thing she left. She was also obliged to throw her self down at the
Door of the RefeEtory, that the Nuns might tread on her as they carne in and
went out. Likewise, that she should perpetually observe the Ecclefiastical
Fast, and never more be created an Abbess, nor be chosen [0 any other
Office in the Conveni: where 1110 had dwelt, and that she should be always sub·
je& to the lowest of them all. Likewise‚ that she should never be allowed
to converse with any Nun without Leave of the Abbess. Likewise‚ that all
the Rags marked with Drops of Blood, which she had given out her spurious Re-
licks‚ and her Effigies describing her, should be every where delivered to the
holy Inquisition 3 or if in any Place there was no Tribunal of the Inquifition,
to the Prelate, or any other Person appointed. Likewise, that she should ne-
ver cover her Head with the sacred Veil‚ and that every Weclnesday and Friday
of the whole Year she ssiould abstain from Meat, and live only on Bread and
Water‚ and that as often as she came into the Refectory, she should pro-
nounce her Crime with a loud Voice in the Presence of all the Nuns.

He tells us in the same Place, that Michael Piedrola took upon himself 101·
many Years the Name of a Prophet, boasted of Dreams and Revelations,
and affirmed they were revealed to him by a divine Voice. Being convisted
of so great a Crime, he abjured de levi, was for ever forbid the reading of
the Bible‚ and other holy Books, deprived of Paper and Ink, prohibited from
writing or receiving Letters‚ unless such only as related [0 his private Af-
fairs, denied the Liberty of disputing about the holy Scripture‚ as well in
Writing as in Discourse‚ and finally, commanded to be thrown into Jayl, and
there pass the Remainder of his Life.]

The common Punilhment of Hereticks is the Confiscation of all their Ef-
fects3 for altho’ this Confiscation is kindly remitted to those who corne of
their own Accord, and voluntarily confess before they are accused, yet this
F avour is never granted in Spain, [0 those who at length confess after they are
accused and thrown into Prison‚ or who perfist in their Opinion. And this
Confiscation is made with such Rigour, that the Inquifition orders the Exche-
quer to seize on not only the Effects of the Persons condemned, but also all
others administred by them, altho' it evidently appears that they belong to
others. The Inquisition at Seville gives a remarkable instance of this Kind,
which Gonsczlvius gives us a long Account of, with all its CircumstanceS.
