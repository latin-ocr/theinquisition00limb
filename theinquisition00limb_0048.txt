50(- E· H· 'The {Det-asion of the Arian Controversy was this. Alexander Bishop of
ἶ· ¹·c· ὃ· Alexandria speaking in a very warrn Manner concerning the Trinity before
the Presbyters and Clergy of his Church‚ affirmed there was an Unity in the
Trinitv, and particularly that the Son was Co-eternal and Consulfianlial, and of the
lame Dignity with the Father. Arius, one of his Presbyters, thought that the
Bilhop, by this Doctrine, was introducing the Sabellian Heresy, and there-
fore opposed him, arguing in this manner : ³ If the Father begot the Son, he who
was begetlen must have a beginning of his Existence3 and from hence, says he, 'tis
manifest, thal there was a Time when he was not ·, the neceffary Consequence of which
E. Η. l. 1.hc affirmed was this, Yhat he had his Suhststence out of ‘Ibings not existing. Sozo-
c. 15· mea adds farther, that he asserted, b‘Ihat by virtue of his &ee-will the Son
was capable of Vice as well as Virlue ; and thas lae was the mere Creature and lVorle of
God. The Bishop being greatly disturbed by these Expreffions of Arius, upon
account of the Novelty ofthem, and not able to bear such an Oppolition from
one of his Presbyters to his own principles, commanded Arius to forbear the
Use ofthem‚ and to embrace the Doetrine of the Consubstantiality and Co—eter-
nity ofthe Father and the Son. But Arius was not thus to be convinced, espe-
cially as a great Number ofthe Bilhops and Clergy were of his Opinion, and
supported him 3 and for this Reason himselfand the Clergy ol his Party were
excommunicated, and expelled the Church‚ in a Council ol near<an Hundred of
the Egyptian and Lyhz'an Bishops met together for thatpurpose‚ by the Bilhop,
who in this case was both Party and Judge, the Enemy and Condemner of Ari-
us. Upon this Treatment Arius and his Friends sent circular Letters to the se-
veral Bishops of the Church‚ giving them an Account oftheir Faith, and desiring
that if they found their Sentiments orthodox, they would write to Alexander in
their Favour ·, if theyjudged them wrong, theytwouldsgive them Instructions
how to believe. Thus was the Dispute carried into the Christian Church‚ and
the Bishops being divided in their Opinions, some of them wrote to Alexander
not to admit Arius and his Party into Communion without renouncing their
Principles, whilst others ofthern perswaded him to ac‘t a different part. The
Bilhop not only followed the Advice of the former, but wrote Letters to the
several Bishops not to communicate with any of them, nor to receive them if
Soc. Eri-they should come to them, nor to credit Eusebius, nor any other Person that
l· 1· c· ⁶· lhould write to them in their behalf, but to avoid them as the Enernies ofGod‚
and the Corrupters ofthe Souls of Men ·, and not so much as to salute them, or
Soz. 1. 1· to have any Communion with them in their Crimes. Eusebius, who was Bishop
Ε· ¹5· of Nicomedia, sent several Letters to Alexander, exhorting him to let the Con-
troversy peaceably drop, and to receive Arius into Communion; but finding
