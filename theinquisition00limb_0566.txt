¹3²5 The H1s1-:0mr ofthe INQUISITION.

CHAP. IX.

Os the {Vltncff’g and who are admitted as Witneffes before the ‘Tri-
bunal ofthe INQJ181T10N.

F T E R the Denouncer harh discharged his Duty by legally denouncing‚

he harh no farther Concern, but the whole Affair is left to the Inquifitor

to make Inquisition concerning the Offence of the Offender, from the Witnes-

ses named by the Denouncer. Before therefore we proceed to the Examina-

tion of the Witneffes‚ we must premise some Things concerning the Witnes-
ses themselves, viz. as to their Person and Number.

All Persons may be Witneffes as well in Civil as Criminal Causes that are not
expressly prohibited. In the Affair of the Inquifition, in Favour of the Faith‚
all Persons, even such as are not allowed in other Tribunals, are admitted as
VVitneffes, Enemies only excepted. But here they distinguish between the
Accuser or Denouncer‚ and the Witness. For although an Enemy can never
be a witness, he rnay be an Accuser or Denouncer‚ and his Denunciation

Campeg. must not be neglected by the Inquisitor, according to Campegius. , · ·
inlanch. “ ln the Crime of Heresy any one may be an Accuser, even an Enemy.
⁶· ¹3· d. ‘⁶ For as the Judge doth not co xdemn according to the Perition of the Accu-
“ ser, but the Proofs of the Witnesses, there can be little Danger if an Ene-
“ my be admitted to accuse. He adds, that he hath often found in the Ex·
“ ercife of this sacred office, that Enemies have made, not a false but true
“ Denunciation‚ which he hath known to happen by heavenly Counsel and the
“ just Judgment of God„ For this blind World can’t as yet understand ὼε
“ Wickedness and Pravity of this Crime3 and therefore we see that Mor-
“ -tals are more ready to accuse and punish Thieves and Murffierers, than to
‘⁶ corre& and condemn Hereticks, Yea, when Inquifitionis made against
“ any one for Heresy‚ or he is taken up, all >run together, and pray,' and be-
“ seech, excuse, and endeavour to defend him, and say that they are· wicked
“ and very vile Persous, who would marl< the poor Man for an Heretick. Be-
“ fides, they call the Officers very cruel‚ if they strive to reduce an
·“ Heretick to the Light of Truth, by Imprisonment‚ Bonds‚ and Fetters,
“ or finally by Tortures, and think they do God great Servioe, if they strive,
‘⁶ tho’ unjustly, to free nin] froin Imprisonment and Bonds‚ and to deliver him
“ out ofthe Hmu's ofthe lnquifitors. They would rather he was dismissed,
‘¹ as they say, only with holy water. If we answer and put thern in mind of
‘⁸ the Criine of High Treason against earthly Majesty, they reply, this is
“ quite another Thing‚ that the Cases very rnuch differ, and the like. As
‘³ tno’ ’twas a less 'l'hing to offend the great God than an earthly Prince.
“ These Things are rather to be lamented than rehearsed. Let us therefore
c pray the Lord to open the Eyes of those blind Pei-sons, and to preserve his
