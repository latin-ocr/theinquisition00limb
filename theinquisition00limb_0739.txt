The HrsToRY osthe INQUISITION. 317

fraud, Impostures, and the most accursed Hypocrisy, by which the Inqui-
s1tors, under the seigned Pretence of Sanctity, endeavour to disguise the Vil-
lany of their ProceedingS‚ that so they may maintain their Dominion over the
miserable common People‚ and keep them all in Subjeffion to themselves,
And tho’ they do every Thing that is wicked and vile, yet they would have
all adore them for the veneraole Charaster ofSanCtity.

’Tis needless to mention here more instances of their Cruelty. Ι shall say
all in a few Words. The MiserIes of the Jayl‚ iu which the Prisoners are
generally confined by themselves for several Years, shut up in Darkness, with-
out being allowed any human converse, are so great ; the Cruelty of their
Torments so severe, and their Punilhments so exquisite, that they greatly ex-
ceed the Cruelty of all other Courts. For Persons are not only burnt alive,
but their Mouths gagged, so that they have not the Liberty to groan or
cry out in those most horrible Tortures 3 and by thus stopping up their
M'ouths‚ they are in such an Agony as that they are almost strangled. But
their Cruelty towards the Penitent and converted is most detestable. For
whereas the Church ought, with open Arms, to embrace PenitentS, in lmi-
tation of the Shepherd who carried the lost Sheep on his Shoulders‚ and brought
it home to the Sheepfold5 these Wretches injoin the most grievous P'unish-
ments on those whose LiVes they spare, which with them are only wholesome<
Penances. F or they condemn them either to wear the infamous Sambenito, οι·ι
to Imprisonment, or the-Gallies, whereby their very Life is ostentimes a Pu-

” nilhment to thern ·‚ whilst othersare denied the very Hopes of Life, especi-
ally the Relapsed, t-ho' they convert themselves, who are condemned to Death·
without Mercy. And yet the Sacraments are given to those who ¹are rocon-
ciled to the Church when they defire it, and thus before they are put to Death·
they become Members of the Church, put in aState of Salvation, and by the⁴
Priests themselves most certainly affured osan heavenly Crown. Can there be
any greater Cruelty, and more abhorrent from the Spiris-of Christkmsty, than
to punish with Death an erroneous Person who xrepents, detests· his Error, andr
is now reconciled to the Church ? But theEcclefiast-ical Sanctions must be sa»-
t-isfied‚ and the Authority of the Church preserved intire‚ tho’ the Laws of Je⁰2
sus Christ and the Commands of- the Gospel are trampled under Foot.

All these Iniquities are committed according to the very Laws osthe loqui--
fition. Many Things are indeed in the Execution· of this Offi'ce, left to the⁴

l Pleasure of the inquisit-ors, which Power they often villanoussy abisse, as ap-
pears from their daily Praffice, and innumerable Instance53 sor it was the·
