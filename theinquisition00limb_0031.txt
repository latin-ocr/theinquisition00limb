did not esteem the Gods worshipped by the City to be really Gods, and that heVU· ἕθεν
introduceed new Deities. This last part of his Accusation was undoubtedly
owing to his inculcating upon them more rational and excellent Conceptions of
the Deity, than were allowed by the established Creeds of his COuntry, and to
his arguing against the Corruptions and Superstitions which 116 saw universally
practised- by the Greeks. This was called corrupting the Youth who were his
Scholars, and what, together with his' superior Wisdom, raised him many
Enemies amongst all soittsos People, who loaded him with Reproaches, anci
spread Reports concerning him greatly to his Disadvantage, endeavouring
thereby to prejudice the Minds os his very Judges against him. When he was
brought to his Trial several of his Acculers were never so much as named 01·

he maintained his own Innocence with the nob‘lest Resolution and Courage ;·
shewed he was far from corrupting the Youth, and openly declared that he be—

bl'effed Spirit that afterwards rested on the Apostles of Christ, that if they.
would dismiss him upon theCondition of not teaching his Philosophy any more,
