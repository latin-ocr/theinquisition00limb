The H1sToRY of the INQutsITION.

,“ any Purgatory for Souls, and of Consequence that PrayerS, and Altus,

‘⁶ and Maffes, and other Vows of Piety, which are made by the Faithful

“ for the Dead‚ can at all profit them. Item, Detrafflng from the Prelates of
‘⁶ the Church of Rome, they deny and condemn their State, saying, that they

‘⁶ are blind, and Leaders of the Blind, and that they do not preserve the Go-

“ spel Truth, nor follow the Apostolick Poverty. They also obstinately

‘⁶ and falssy affirm, that the Church of Rome is the House of a Lye. Item,

ὅ* Comparing themselves with the Apostolical Life and Perfection, and equal-

“ ling themselves to them in Merit, they vainly glory in themselves, boasting

“ that they hold and preserve the Evangelick and Apostolick Poverty. Item,

“ These and other Things, as well erroneous as rnad, they privately dog-

“ matize to their Believers in their Conventicles. Item, They preach from*
“ the Gospels and Epistles, and other sacred Writings, which by expound-

“ ing they corrupt, as Masters of Errors‚ who know not how to be Disciples

“ of the Truth, because the Preaching and Expofition of the sacred Scrip-
⁸‘ tures is wholly forbidden to the Laity. Item, The said Se& of the Val-
‘ denses differs and disagrees in several Things, in Life and Manners, from
“ the common Conversation of the F aithful, as is found and plainly appears
‘⁶ by the Inquifition and Examination as well of the Valdenses themselves, as>
‘⁶ their Believers, and especially by the Confeffions of those who are con-
“ verted by the Inquifitors from that Se& and Heresy. Moreover, thou
‘⁶ John hast judicially before us and elsewhere, oftentimes approved and
‘⁶ praised the said Se& and Heresy of the Valdenses, and dost yet approve
⁶‘ and commend it, nor wilt depart from it, nor abjure and forsake it, but
“ rather perseverest in it with an obstinate Mind, altho' by us and several
“ other good Men thou hast been oftentimes invited to Converfion, and
“ hast been canonically admoniffied and judicially required by us, that
‘⁶ in Heart and Deed thou ffiouldst turn from it, and with thy Mouth and
‘⁶ Soul wholly abjure it. We therefore the foresaid Inquifitors‚ hav-ing God·
“ before our EyeS, &a do declare and pronounce, and deliver you over to
“ the secular Court‚ as relapsed into the Heresy which you have before
ss judicially abjured, and as an impenitent and obstinate Heretick, affectio-
ss‘ nately bewailing it, as the canonical Sanstions oblige us to do, to preserve
⁶³ your Life and Members untouched, Signed,

From these Instances it appears, that the Opinions of the Albigenſs’s and
Valdenses were different. However‚ ’tis not to be doubted, but that often-
times their Enemies gave very vile and odious Accounts of the Doftrines they
heich as will appear by comparing the several Places in which they de-
