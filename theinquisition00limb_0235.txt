The HrsToRY ofthe INQUISITION} 67-

sent to the Pope, to get him to ratify the Council’s Sentenee, and Lewis, eldest
Son of Philip the French King, confirmed him in the Posseffion.

During these Transactions Pope Innocent III. in the Year of our Lord 1215.
called the famous Lateran Council, where Dominick was present, in which there
were many Decrees against Hereticks, which were afterwards inserted in the
Decretals of Gregory, Tit. de Haeret. cap. 13. To this Council fled the Earl of
Tholouſs’, with his Son Raymond‚ being dispofl'effed of his Dominions by Mom-
fort, Guido, the Brother of Earl Montsort, appeared against him, and aster
many Debates‚ Earl Raymond is declared, to besor ever excluded from his Do-
minions, which he had govern'd ill, and ordered to remain in some convenient Place
ont of his own Lands, in order to his giving sititable Proofs of his Repentance„
Four hundred Marks of Silver were affigned him yearly out of his Revennes, as
long as he behaved himself with an hnmhle Ohedience. Bm as all hore Testimony to
his wife, that she was a good Catholick Lady, she was left in Poffeffion of the
Lands of her Dowry, provided she caused the Commands of the Church to he oh-
served, and suffered none to disturb the Affairs of Peace or Faiih. Howevcr,
all that the Cross-bearers had taken was adjudged to Montfort 3 and as to the
rest, which they had not seized on, the Church decreed it should he kept hy proper
Persons, to preserve the Peace, and the Faith‚ that there might he some Provifion for
the only Son of the Earl of Tholouse‚ according as he should deserve it in Part or
W'hole, after his coming to Age.

Upon this Decree of the Synod Raymond went into Spain, and his Son Ray·
mond into Provence, where, with the Help of many auxiliary Forces, he made
War on Montfort. He recovered some Part of his Dominions, and even the
City of Tholouse it self. Whilst Montfort was endeavouring to retake it with a
large Army, he was killed by the Blow of a Stone, and thereby the City de-
livered from the Siege. Thus Raymond recover'd by Arms his F ather’s Earl-
dom, who died in the Year 1221. and was succeeded by thisfhis Son, who could
not obtain, with all his Endeavours, a Christian Burial for his F ather.

As Things thus took a differentTurn, sometimes according to the Pope’s
Wish‚ at other Times contrary to it, ¹he preffed the Inquisition as the most
effeetual Remedy for the Extirpation of HeretickS. Bzovius relates‚ that ata-¹215}
this Time many Hereticks were burnt in Germany, France, and Italy, and that §⁹ ⁷·
in this Year no less than 80 Persons were apprehended at once in the City of
Strasbourg, of whom but a very few were declared innocent. If any of these de· ,
nied their Heresy‚ Friar Conrade of Marpurg, an Apostolical Inquzfitor of the Or-
der ofPredicantS, put them to the T rial of the Fire Ordeal, and as many of them as
were burnt by the Iron, he delivered over to the Secular Power to he burnt as Hereticks ;

tot e ames.

About that Time Pope Honorius sent a Rescript to the Bifhop of Boulogne, Bzovius5
anathematlzing all Hereticks‚ and Violaters of the Ecclefiastical 11nmunity‚a· ¹2¹8·
in these Words : We excommunicate all Hereticks of both Sexes, of whatsoever 8⁶27, ς’ ¹ ¹'
with their Favourers, Receivers, and Defenders 3 and moreover, all those who cause
any Edias or Customs, contrary to the Liberty Itis the Church, to be observed, 707?ss
