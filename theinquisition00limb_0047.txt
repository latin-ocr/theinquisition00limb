by the same Rule every Christian, that bath Power, is in the right to perse-
cute his Christian Brother, whenever he believes him to be in the wrong. And
in truth, they seem generally to have atsted upon this Principle3 sor which
Party soever of them could get uppermost was against all Toleration and Li-
berty for those wlfio differed from them, and endeavoured by all Methods to
op'll'rligsggriltiffigritcsyotfhthe‘l’rimitive Christians‚ at least for near three Centuries,
in reference to the Deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, were, generally speaking,
pretty uniform; nor do there appear to have been any publick Qarrels
about this Article of the Christian Faith. Some few Persons indeed, differed Euseb-
from the commonly received Opinion. One Theodotus a Tanner, under theE.H.1.5‚
Reign of Commodus, afferted Christ was a meer Man, and on this Account was ς’ ²3⁸
excommunicated, with other of his Followers, by Pope Vmor, who appears
to have been very liberal in his Censores against others. Artemon propagated
the same erroneous Opinion under Severus. Beryllns also, an Arabian Bishoprid. 1. 6³
under Gordian, taught, That our Saviour had no proper personal Subfistencec· 33·
before his becoming Man, nor any proper Godhead of his own, but only the
Father's Godhead residing in him ; but afterwards alter'd his Opinion, being
convinced os his Error by the Arguments os Origen. Sabellins also propagated1.7. c. 27,-
much the same Doc'trine, denying also the real Personality ofthe Holy Ghost.
After him Paulus Sanzqs‘ntenus, Bishop of Antioch, and many of his Clergy, 28, 29.
publickly avowed the same Principles concerning Christ, and were excommu-
nicated by a large Council of Bissiops, But though these Excommunications
upon account of Differences in Opini0n‚ prove that the Bishops had set up for
Judges os the Faith, and affumed a Power and Dominion over the Consciences
os others, yet as they had no civil Effedts, and were not enforced by any penal
Laws, they were not attended with any puhlick ConfusionS, to the open Re-
proach of the Christian Church. “

But when once Christianity was settled by the Laws of the Empire, and the
Bishops free to a& as they pleased, without any sear of publick Enemies
to disturb and oppress them, they fell into more shameful and violent QarrelS,
upon account of their Differences concerning the Nature and Dignity of Christ.
The Controversy first began between Alexander Bishop of Alexandria, and Anius De vk.
one of his Presbyters, and soon spread it self into other Churches, enflaming Const.1.2,
Bishops against Bishops, who out of a Pretence to support Divine Truth cxci-‘3⁶¹' H
ted Tumults, and entertained irreconcilable Hatreds towards one another.{⁰f]{'6‚f
These Divisionsofthe Prelates set the Christian People together by the Ears,
as they happened to favour their different Leaders and Heads of Partie53 and
the Dispute was managed with such violence, that it soon reached the whole
Christian World, and gave Occasion to the Heathens in several Places to ridi-
cule the Christian Religion upon their publick Theatres. How different wereiiui'eb.[52v
