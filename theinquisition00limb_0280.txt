sent twelve Men to the Legate, to beg Peace and Absolution. Matthew
quite broke by these Evils and others that threaten’d him, resigned the
Principality to his Son Galeacz‘us, and order’d himself to be carried into the
principal Church, where he complain’d that he was unjustly accused of Heresy;
and protessing by an Oath that he was without any Crime deprived of divine
Services‚ he appeal'd to God, the righteous Judge, that he was condemn'd
most unrighteoussy by the faffious Legate, and forced to abandon his Country.
Thus departing from the City, and making the same Profeffion the Day af.
ter in the Church of St. John Baptist at Mouza, he fell into a Fever, and died
some Days after with Grief and Sorrow. His Sons buried him in a private
mean Place‚ concealing for some Time his Death, least his Body should have
been burn’d, according to the Order of the Cardinal Legate and Inquifflors,

them Hereticks‚ and manifest Arch-hereticks, and commanded all who fol-
lowed their Dofitrine, to be universally accounted as Hereticks. He farther
enjoin'd all the Faithsul that they should not presume to receive, defend,
maintain, or afford, by themselves, or any other or others, publickly or pri-
vately‚ direffly or infflreffly, any Affistance‚ Counsel or F avour to them, or
any of them, but that they should rather avoid them as manifest Hereticks.
Finally, he orders the F aithful to seize on them, that they might prosecute
sthem with a Zeal becoming the Farith; and to take thern where-ever they
could find them ; and when taken, to deliver them to the Church, that they
might undergo the deserv’d Punishment.
