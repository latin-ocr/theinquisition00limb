But afterwards, upon his sharp and long Disputes with the Donatists, tho' he
was so far of the same Mind, as that he was not willing to punish them with
Dearh, yet he so far altered his Opinion, as that he did not disapprove of, but
was for affually infliffing all Punilhments, which did not cut off the Hopes of
Repentance, i. e. all manner, Death only excepted3 that being terrified by
them, they might be compelled to embrace the orthodox Faith; which he -
hath ihewn in a few Words, in his second Book of Rammium, e. 5. I have
two Books entitled, Against the Donatists: In the first I declared, that I did not
approve that schismatical Persbns fhould be compelled to Communion by any secular
Power. 'The Reason was, because I had not then experienced what great Mischief
would arise from their Impunity, nor how much Good Discipline would conduce to their
Converfion. He argues the same more largely in his 48th Letter to Vincentius,
on Account of the Rogatian Heresy ε My first Opinion was, that none was to be
forced to the Unity of Christ 3 but that he was to be dealt with by Words, fought with
by Argument, overcome by Reason, lest those who once were open Hereticks should be-
come feigned Catholicks. But I changed my Opinion, not from the Contradibtion of
others, but from demonstrative Examples. My own City was first alledged‚ which
tho' entirely in the Heresy of Donatus, was converted to the Catholick Unity by Fear of
the Imperial Laws, and now so thoroughly detests their pernicious Animostty, that one
would be apt to believe it had never been infeb‘t‘ed with it. Many other Cities were·
particularly named to me, so that from hence I understood the Meaning of what is
written, Give Opportunity to a wife Man, and he will be wiser. For how ma-
ny, to our certain Knowledge, were willing to become Catholicks, convinced by evident
T ruth ; but yet deferred it through Fear of offending their Friends ,Ρ How many ⁴
were held in Subjebtion, not to T ruth, in which you never had any Concern,
hut to Obstinacy of Habit‚ whereby was fulfilled in them that divine Pafflzge, An
evil Servant will not grow better by Words; even though he understand,
he will not obey. How many imagined that the Donatists were the true Church‚
because Security had render'd them proud, floathful and negligent in their Enquiries
after the Catholick ‘Truth ? How many were prevented, by the false Reports of Slan-
derers, from entring into the Churcb3 who gave out that we placed I know not
what upon the Altar of God ? How many thought it indff’rent to what Party a
Christian belonged, and therefore continued Donatists‚ because they were born in that
Seu, and no one forced them to forsake it, and return to the Catholick Faith? Now
the Terror of those Laws, by the Publication of which Kings serve the Lord with
Fear, was offiaech Advantage to all these, that they ssiy, some of them : This was what
*we intended. Bleffed be God, that hath given us the Occefion of doing it now, and
prevented all farther Delays. Others say .· This we knew to be true. But we

Bonds in sunder, and hath brought us to the Bond of Peuce. Others fizy .· W» knew
