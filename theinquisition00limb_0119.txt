R E M A R Κ s upon the H 1 s T o R Y of Christian Persecution.

I. ’ IS a Truth too evident to be denied, That the Clergy in general,
throughout almost all the several Ages of the Christian Church, have
been deep and warm in the Measures of Persecution ; as though it had been a
Dofitrine expressy inculcated in the sacred Writings, and recommended
by the Praffice of our Saviour and his Apostles. Indeed, could such
a Charge as this have been justly fixed on the great Author of our Religion,
or the Meffengers he sent into the World to propagate it3 I think it would.
have been such an Evidence ofits having been dietared by weak, or wicked,
or worldly minded Men, as nothing could poffibly have disproved. But that
Christianity might be free from every Imputation of this kind, God was-
pleased to send his Son into the World, without any of the Advantages of
worldly Riches and Grandem, and absolutely to disclaim all the Prerogatives
of an earthly Kingdom. His distinguishing Charaeter was that of meek (md
low1y5 and the Methods by which he conquered and triumphed over his Ene-
mies, and drew all Men to him, was Patience and Constancy‚ even to the Deatln
And when he sent out his own Apostles, he sent them out but poorly furnish-
ed, to all human Appearance, for their Journey; without stava, or Scrip, orLukeix·3-

give them3 and that their whole Dependance was on Providence. One
Thing however he assured them of, that they should be delivered up to the Matt. Χ,
Cauneas, and scourged in the Synagogues, and be hated of all Men for his sake. So¹7‘
far was he from giving them a Power to persecute, that he. foretold them
they must suffer Persecution for his Name: This the Event abundantly ju-
stified. And how amiable was their Behaviour under it? How greatly did.

ment they used to convince those they preached to, was the Demonstration ofthe
Spirit, and of Power. They approved themselves as the Ministers of God, by much
