suffered Persecution unholy. And a little after ε If therefore we will acknowledge
the Truth, that is an unjust Perfi’cutzon, which the Wicked make on the Church of
Christ, and that a just Persecution which the Churches of Christ make on the
Wicked. So that the Church is bleffed which suffers Persecution for Righteousneſs
sake, and they miserable who stiffer Persecution for Unrighteoufheſs. Resides, the
Church persecutos, by Love 3 they, by Rage 3 she, that she may correct ;
they, in order to overthrow ·, she, that she may recal from Error; they,
to force others into it. She persecutes and apprehensis Enemies, to cure them of their
Vanity, and that they may advance in the Truth ·, they return Evilfor Good, and be-
cause we consult their eternalSalvation, endeavour to deprive us of our temporal Safety.
And afterwards : ’Τίς an Instance ofMercy to them, because by theseImperial Laws,
they are snatched, tho' against their Wills, from that Sea, where they have learnt
their Errors from the Dottrines of Devils‚ that they may be healed by being accu-
stomed to found Doarines and Mdnners in the C atholick Church. For many of thoss’,
whose pious Fervour of Faith and Charity in the Unity of Christ we now admire,
give Thanks to God with great Gladness, that they are not now in the Error to think
those evil Things good ·‚ which Thanks they would never have given willingly, un-
less they had been forced unwillingly to depart from that accursed Society.

As to the Ohjeffiom that the Apostles never defired such Methods from
the Kings of the Barth, he answers3 Thac none of the Emperors then be-
lieved in Christ, and therefore could no: serve him by making Laws for
Godliness, against Impiety. But afterwards, when that began to be fulfilled,
which is written, All the Kings of the Earth shall worship him, all Nations
shall serve him, what Person in his Wz‘ts could then thus addreſs himseff to Kings ἒ
It doth not concern you, who in your Dominions defends or opposes the Church of our
Lord, who will be religious or impious. May it not as well be said, It is nothing to
you, who in your Dominions is chast or lewd ἒ For stnce God hath given to all Men
Freedom of Wll, why should Adulteries be punished by Law, and Sacrileges per·-
mitted ,Ρ Is the Prefi’rvation of the Soul’s Fidelity to God of leſs Importance than
a Woman's to her Husband ἒ Or because thofie Things which are done, not from any
Contempt of Religion, but merely thro’ Ignorance, are to be more gently animad- N, B,
verted on, are they therefore to be entirely negletted ἒ Who doubts whether it be
better to draw Men to the PVorship eff God by Argument, than to compet them with
the Fear of Punishment or Pain ? But doth it follow, that because those who ‘are
won by Reason are the best, that therefore others are to be wholly disteegarded ,Ρ We can
produce many Instances to prove, of how great Advantage C ompulfion⁸by Fear and Pain
hath been, they having been hereby render'd open to Instruttion, or excited to the Pra-
ttice of what they have been taught. And afterwards : To what Purpose do these
Men cry out, Men are free either to believe, or not believe. To whom did Christ
use Violence Ρ Whom did he force? I produce the Apostle Paul. Let them own
that Christ first forced, and afterwards taught him ·, first struck, and then comforted
him. 'Tis wonderful to constder, how he, who, forced by bodily Punishment, first
entered into the Gospel, laboured in it more abundantly than all they, who “by the [Vora'
only were called to the Belias of it. By how much greater his Fear was that'forced his
Love,by so much the more perfett was his Love tlhat cast out Fear. Why then should nZt
