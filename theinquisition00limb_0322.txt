The HISTORY ofthe INQmsn-mN.

Office, who is always a Dominarum, and an Assessor General. [Besides
these there is present the Master of the sacred Palace‚ who also always used
to be of the Dominiccm Order. But because his Power is very large, especi-
ally in the Prohibition ofBooks‚ it is worth while to describe that Office a lit·
tle more distinffly. The Master therefore of the sacred Palace, when there
is a Confistory, ordinarily reads in the Pope’s Palace something in Divinity.

· t 'x They say this Office was appointed by the Pope at the Advice of Domi-
temnit-k. For seeing daily, that when the Cardmals were engaged with the Pope,
23· [Μῃ- Clergy and Attendance spent their Time in idle Walks and Trifles, he

wem [Ο [he Pope, and said, It was a Shame thatthose Ministers, who profeffed
all virtue, should do such scandalous Thing5‚ and defile [hOse hOIY walls
with the most unbecoming Scurrilities. That he thought it would be ve-
ry useful, that whilst the Cardinals were attending him upon the Affairs of
the universal Churcl„ somelearned Man should publickly inter-pret certain
Places ofthe sacred Scripture. Honorius was pleased with the Motion‚ and
appointed Domz'nz‘ck himself to the Office,'j who had advised it. So that Domi-
nick himself was the first Master of the holy Falace³ and it was appomted that
some Body should be always chosen to that Office out of the Predicant Or-
der, and called Master of the sacred Palace·, and he hath these Prerogatives.
Fjlst’ That he always dwells in the very Apostolick Palace, with his Atten-
dance and Houshold‚ and hath a Salary for his Support affigned him by the
Pope& Second& He s1ts in the Pope's Chapel near his Holiness’s Feet‚ and
Pseceedg all the Divines and Masters in Place, Advice and Resolution. Third-
ζ), without his Licence no Book can be printed at R0me3 nor any Oratim!
or Sermon pronounced before the Pope, without his Revislng and Appro-
batim, Fourthly, In all Conferences and Disputations‚ his Definition, Resolu-
tion and Sentence prevails, and no one can reply after him. Lastly‚ He is al-
ways present in the Congregation of the most holy Inquisition, with the Pope
and Cardinals, He hath also the Title of the most Reverend‚ and is the first
of the Predicant Order, after the Master General 3 and to conclude, he is chosen
into the Office by the Election and Nomination of the Pope, and not by
Vote.

These supreme Inquifitors have also an Advocate Fiscal, several Coun-
sellom, Prelates and Regulars, viz. the General of the Dominican Order, and
‚the Assistant of the Commiss'ary of the holy Office ς as also one of the Religi—
ous of the Francisccm Order. They have also several Qalificator Divines‚ who
qualify Propofitions in any Cases that occur.] Whatever the Majority of the
Cardinals decree, Pius IV. by a Constitution beginning, Cum 7205 per nostrum, &a
ordered should be lookcd on as the Decree ofthe whole Congregation ·, yea, that
what the major Part ofthe. Inquifitors present should appoint, should be esteem-
ed as done by all, though some were absent ·, that by the absent Cardinals were
to be understood not such as were absent from Rome, because it might be very
difficult to know this, but such Cardinals as were absent from this Congregation.

These supreme Inquifitors meet twice a Week, viz. on Wedncjsdays for-

merly in the House os the oldest Cardinal supreme Inquifitor, but nowSin
