The H1sToRY ofthe InoutstrtoN. 307

After this Oath the Sentence of Excommunication was pronounced against
such as should hinder. the Office of the Inquifition, by which all were put
under Excommunication‚ Who have knowingly hindercd the Office of the Inqujfi-
tion, or for the future shall hinder it by any Means, direeely or indireeely, openly or
secretly, either by concealing the T ruth themselves, or revokz‘ng what they have legally
confiffed, or by unlawfully persuading others to conceal or revoke it 3 and also who-
soever shall direeely or indireetlv, openly or privately, knowingly grant Counsel,
Afflstance or Favour herem. Thus runs the first F orrn of Excommunication in
the second Sermon in the Book of Sentences, which was in others differently
enlarged, that no Person, ever so ssightly suspected, might escape the Hands
of the InquifitorS, and that the Magistrate might have no poffible way of
throwing any Hindrance to the lnquifitors in their holy Office.

After this follows the A& of the Inquifition‚ and that the Tribunal may

the same time a great many to the same or heavier Punish ments. From some
they took their Croffes, and injoined them some arbitrary Penance. Others
were brought out of Jayl‚ and had Croffes put on them, which was a leffer
Punishment. When these Favours were bestowed, the Sentences were read
over, by which Penances were injoined the Criminals.

The first Sentences were those of the Cross-Bearers, who were injoined to ν
wear Croffes on theIr Breast and Back, and if their Crimes were very heinouS‚
they were condemned to wear two, If it happened that their Faults were
ssight, they were injoined arbitrary Penance without Croffes. An Instance of
which we have, fol. 81. Then follow the Sentences of those who were to be
immured, who were condemned to perpetual Imprisonment, there to do
wholesome Penance with the Bread of Grief, and Water of Affliction. If
the Offences of any such were very grievous, they were more closely and
straitly confined, and put in Irons.

Then follow the Sentences of the Impenirent and Relapsed‚ who are deli-
vered over to the secular Court 3 then the Sentences against the Dead, and
against the Houses in which any Persons have committed Heresy, and final-
ly against the F ugitives. When the Sentence is pronounced, the Gospels are
placed before the InquifitorS‚ as tho' nothing was decided without taking
Counsel from God. This their usual Form‚ which generally occurs In the
Sentences, plainly shews. Having God before our Eyes, and the Purity of the
orthodox Faith, and having thesse holy Gospels placed before us, that our Sentence may
come from the Face of God, and our Eyes may behold Equity.

The whole A& being finiffied, the Inquifitor performed three Things.Eymer·
First, He granted forty Days Indulgencies to all who were present at Churchl'· 3·
at the aforesaid Acts of Faith. Secondly, He proclaimed publickly, that alln' ¹⁹5·
who had given Counsel‚ Affistance or F avour, towards any one’s abjuring
Heresy‚ and returning to the Unity of the Church, viz. all such as inform,
bear Witness‚ advise, read the Crimes, Abjuration and Sentence, and the
Officers who keep them in Custody‚ shall obtain three Years Indulgencies

from the Pope. Thirdly, He notifile³s to all, that whosoever knows any ΗΞ,
