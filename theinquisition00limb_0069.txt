 

The INTRonucrtoN.

Under the Reign oi Theodofius, Arcadius his Son, those who were called He-

reticks were grievoussy persecuted by the Orthodox. {Thebae-nm, Bishop ofSoc- l·7-
Synnada in Phrygia, expelled great Numbers os the Followers of macedonius c. 3·
from the City and Country round about, Notfrom any Zealfor the true Fano, as
Socrates says, but through Covetotlfizeli, and a Defign to extas-t stloney from them.
On this Account he used all his Endeavours to oppress them, and particularly
Agapetzcs their Bishop‚ armed his Clergy against them, and accused them before
the Tribunal of the Judges. And because he did not think· the Governors ofthe
Provinces sufficient to carry on this good Work of Persecution, he went to Con-
stantinople to procure fresh Edic‘cs against them; but by this means he lost his
Bishoprick, the People resuslng him Admiffion insso the Church upon his re-
turn, and chufing Agapetus‚ whom he had persecuted, in his room.

dead, Cyrill was enthroned in his room, not without great Disturbance and Op-
pofition from the People, and used his Power for the Oppresfion os Hereticks 3
for immediately upon his Advancement, he ssmt up all the Churches of the
Novatians in that City, took away all their sacred Treasures, and stripped fl’beo-
pemptus their Biffiop, ofevery Thing that he had. Nor was this much to bel-⁷· 013,
wonder’d at, fince, as Socrates observes, that from the Time of Theophilus,¹4·
Cyrill’s Predeceffor, flhe Bifhop of Alexandria began to affitme anAuthority and
Power above what belonged to the sacerdotal Order. On this Account the great
Men hated the Bishops‚ because they usurped to themselves agood part os that
Power which belonged to the imperial Governors of Provinces ; and particu-
larly, Cyrill was hated by Orestes, Prefec't of Alexandria, not only for this Rea-
son, but because he was a continual Spy upon his Affions. At length their
Hatred to each other publickly appeared. Cyrill took on him, without ac-
quainting the Governor, or contrary to his leave, to deprive the Jews oi all
their Synagogues, and banished them from the City‚ and encouraged the Mob

publickly insulted him, calling him Sacrificer and Pagan ς adding many other
injurious Reproaches. One of them, called Ammonius, wounded him in the
Head with a Stone, which he flung at him with great violence, and covered
him all over with Blood·, and being, according to the Laws, put by Orestes
publickly to the Torture, he died through the Severity of it. St.C><7·illhonou1--
ably received the Body into the Church, gave him the new Name of Thauma-
stus, or, ‘The Wonderful, ordered him to be looked on as a Martyr‚ and lavishly
extolled him in the Church‚ as a Person murthered for bis Religion. This
scandalous Procedure of Cyrill’s the Christians themselves were aihamed os,
because 'twas publickly known, that the Monk was punished for his lnsolence;
and even St. Cyrill himself had the Modesty at »last to use his Endeavours that
the whole Affair might be entirely forgotten. The Murther also of Hypatiald. lbi-i.
