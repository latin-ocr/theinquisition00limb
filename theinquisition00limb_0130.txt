the learned Bishop, is afi'xed, cestnz‘n, and nntform Rzaele os Fano and Prafflce,
containing all the most neccffizry Poizsts of Religion, established by a divine Sanfzion,
embraced as such, by all Dencminatiens of Christians, and in it sels abundamly
szffcient to preserve the Iiizowledge and Prafssice of Religion in the W2rld. As to
Points of greater Intricacy, and which require uncmnmon Degrees ο] Penetration and
Ix'nowledge3 such indeed, have been Subjeffs of Dispute amongst Persons of Study and
Lecnning in the several Ages of the Christian Chunlu but the People are not obliged
to enter into them, fi> long as they do not touch the Foundations of Christianity, nor
have an Influence upon Prac‘lice. ,In other Points it is sufficient that they believe the
Dofilrinesjofar as they find, upon due Enquiry ancl Examination, according to theirseve-
ml Abilities and Opportunities‚ that God hath revealed them. This incomparable
Pass‘age of this Reverend and trulyCharitable Prelate‚ I have transcribed'intire ;
because it will undoubtedly give a Sanfiion to my own Principles of universal
Benevolence and Charity. His Lotdship affirms, that all Denominations of Christi-
ans (he will allow me to mention a few of them ; Socinians, Arians‚ Athanafians‚
Sabellians, pelagiam, Arminians,Calvinists, Episcopalians, Presbyterians,1nde-
pendanw, Anabaptists,&c.) agree in the Substance ofReligion, and in the neceffary En-
forcements oftbe Praffice ofit ‚- inasmuch as they do all believe firmly and fincerelyg
those Principles which his Lordship calls, with great Reason and Truth‚ afixed,
certain, and uulform Rule of Faith and Praffice, as containing all the most neceffary
Points vs Religion, and in it sals abundantly sufficient to preserve the Knowledge and
Prac‘iice of Religion in the bllorld. My Inference from this noble Conceffiw,
for which all the Friends to Liberty, in Church and State, throughout Great
Britain, will thank his Lordship, is this; that fince all Denorninations of
Christians do, in his Lordship’s Judgmenr, receive his fixed, certain, and
uniforrn Rule of Faith‚ and embrace all the most necessary Points of Retia
gion; to impose Subscriptions to Articles of Faith and human Creeds, must
be a very unreasonable and needless Thing: For either such Articles and
Creeds σπεεξη nothing more than this same Rule of Faith and Prac'ticffl
and then all Subscriptions to them is Impertinent; because this is already
received by all Denominations of Christians, and is abundantly sufficient, by
the Bilhop's own Allowance, to preserve the Knowledge and Prafiice‘of Re-
{igion in the World: Or such Articles and Creeds contain something more
