The H1s-ronr ofthe INQmsmoN. 3¹5*

well known to all, that Torture is a very deceitsul Method os discovering
the Truth, because those who confess the Truth, and who decl-are Falshoods‚
have the very same End to their Pain. And therefore Lawyers will never
have the Torture made use of, unless when the Crime is sufficiently proved.
and there wants nothing but the Criminal’s own Confeffion. But as to secret
Crimes, to be ready to infliet the Torture is the highest Injustice‚ and necessari-
ly subje&s many innocent Persons to the most grievous Punishment ς whilst
being unable to resist the Cruelty os their Torments, they had rather make
themselves guilty, by a false Conseffion ofa Crime they never so much as
thought of, to put an immediate End to their most ctuel Punilhment‚ than
to endurefagy (longer those most dreadful Torments, of which they can see no
mannero n .

XII. The twelfth is, their putting Persons to the Torture upon half full
Proof of the Crime. This half full Proof is Faultering‚ Defamation‚ and
one Witness os his own Knowledge, or when the Tokens are vehement and
violent. All these Things are subject to the Pleasure os the Judge. So that
if any one falls into the Hands of a cruel Inquisitor, and faulters in his An-
swer‚ or is informed against by one VVitness, who declares he was present at
the Aetion or Words he gives Information of, he can't poffibly escape the
Torture, nor consequently the Punishment of the Crime he is accused of,
considering the Violence ofthe Torments. Nor is this all, but as there may
be some Fafts occasioned not so much by Heresy concealed in the Mind‚ as
by carnal Concupiscence or Ralhness, they will have such to be tortured for
their Intention‚ and force them by Torments to confess they had an heretica!
Intention in their Mind.

XIII. A thirteenth is, that when they prepare themselves for the Torture,
they gravely and serioussy admonish the Criminal, to speak nothing but the
Truth‚ ancl to consess nothing that is not agreeable to Truth to avoid the Tor-
tureS. By this Means they put on the Appearance os Sincerity‚ as tho’ they
fought nothing but the naked Truth, that when the Torture is finilhed they
may be very secure that the tortured Person hath confcffed a real Crime;
because they have serioussy and gravely admonished him to say nothing con-
trary to Truth. In the mean while they suppose, that the Crime objeoted
against him is real, and endeavour to force from him a Confeffion by Tor-
ture, and threaten to double his Torments unless he confeffes·, so that if he
denies the Crime, his Torments are aggravated ; if he confeffes it his Tor-
ments are soon ended. Hence it appears, that their Defign is not honestly to
find out the Truth by Torture, but that they suppose the Crime is real, altho⁹
according to the Laws of the Inquifition it be only half proved, and then
extort a Confeffion of it.

XIV. A fourteenth is, that whereas in other Courts the Number is certain-
