238 The HISTOR'Y of the INQUISITtoN.

In Ecclefiastical History we find two remarkable Forms of AbJ‘ura-
tion prescribed to certain famous Doftors by the Church of Rome. The one
is that of Berengarins, the other that of Jerom of Progne.

Berengarins abjured in these Words. I*Berengarius, an unworthy Deacon of
the Church of St. Maurice of Angiers‚ acknowledging the true and Apostolick Faith,
do anathematzfe every Heresj½ and particularly that for which I have hitherto been
defamed3 which endeavours to prove, that the Bread and bVine placed upon the
Altar- are, after Consecration, only a Sacrament, and not the true Body and Blood
os oin· Lord Jefits Christ, and cannot besenstbly, but only sacramentally‚ handled or
broken hy the Hands of the Priests, nor chewed to Pieces hy the Teeth of the Faith-
ful. Bu‘i I constent to the holy Church of Rome and Apostolick See, and with
my Month and Heart confess that I hold that Faith concerning the Sacrament of the
Lord’s Table, which oar Lord and venerable Pope Nicholas, and this holy Synod,
hy Evangelick and Apostolick Anthority, hath delivered to be held and confirmed to
me, viz. that the Bread and Wne placed on the Altar, are, after Consecration, not
,Only a sacrantem, hat also the true Body and Blood cfour Lord Jesus Christ, andis
broken fi'nfihly, not only Jacramentally, hut in Trath, hy the Hands of the Priests,
,and chewed hy the T ceth of the Faithful, [wearing by the holy and consubstantial Tri-
nity‚ and hy 'these most holy Goſjoels of Christ. And as to those, who* shall go contrany
to this Fano, Ipronounce them, with their Opinious and Followers, worthy of eter-
-nal Damnation. And if I my fhlf fhall at any time presume to think or preach any
fshing contrary to this, I fitbjett my self to the Severity of the Canons. I have volun-
tarilysnhscrihed to this, being read over and thro’.

The Abjuration of Jerom of Prague is longer. I Jerom of Prague, Master
of the liberal Arts, acknowledging the true Catholick Church and Apostolick Faith,
*do anathematift every Heresy, and especially that for which I have hitherto been de-
famed, and which informer Times John Wycleff and John Huss have dogmatised
and held in their JaVorks, Books, or Sermons to the Clergy and People, for which
Reason the aforesaid Perfhns‚ with their Opinions and Errors, have been condemned
as Hereticks by this Synod of Constance, and their aforesaid Docirine sententially
,. damned, especially in some Articles exprcffed in the Sentences prononnced against
them hy this holy Council. I consent also to the holy Church of Rome, and the Apo-
fiolick See, and this holy Council‚ and with my Mouth and Heart profeſs it, in and
-concerning all Things, and especially concerning the Keys, Sacraments, Orders, Offi-
ces and Ecclefiastical Censures, Indulgencies, and Relicl‘s of Saints, and Ecclesiasti-
cal Liberty, as affl> concerning the C eremonies, and all other Things pertaining to the
vChristian Religion, even as the Church of Rome and Apostolick See, and this holy
‚Council profeſs3 and particularly that most of the aforesaid Articles are notoriously
heretical, and long stnce condemned by the holy Fathers 3 some of them blasphemans,
others erroneous‚ others scandalous, some of them offenfive to pions Ears, and others
of them rash and fieditious 3 and the aforesaid Articles have been lately condemned as
such hy this holy Commii, and it hath been forbidden all and stngztlar Catholicks, un-

der Penaltyof an Anathema, eversor the future lo prefinne to preach‚ doginatiſs’, or ’
to hold the said Articles, or any one of them.
