The Htsronv of the INQmsmon.

Religion ought to be voluntary, yea sometimes they have been protested

gy ,εἶξε Papal Authority against the Injuries of some intemperately zealous
iri lans.

Thus Pope InnocentIII. publiffied a Constitution for not oppressmg the ’
· Jews, in which there are these Things. W'e ordain that no Christian shall by

Violence compel them (the Jews) against their Inclination and Wzlt' to come to Bap-
tisin. But if any of them shall, of their own accord, come over to the Christians
upon account of the Paith, after he shall hove distovered his Intention, let him he-
come a Christian without any Reproach. Such a one cannot he snpposed to have the
true Faith os Christianity, who is known to come to Christian Baptism not volunta-
rily hut unwillingly. Farther, let no Christian without the Orderof the fiecular
Power, wickea'ly hurt their Persons, or prestane by Violence to take away their Ef-

fefft's, or to change the good Cnstoms which they have hitherto, used in the Countries

where they dwell. Mei-aver, let no one disturb them with Sttcks or Stones in the
Celebration of their Fe ival53 nor let any one strive to exaffit or extort from them
undue Service5‚ nor any bat those which they have„ been accustomed to yield in Times
fast. Ancl that we may prevent the chea'neſs and Covetousness of evil stAen, we
decree that no one shall darc to mangle or leſjZ’n the Burial-place of the Jews, or
with a View to get Money, to dig up their Bodieswhen huried. But if any one,
which Gocl forbid, knowing the Tenorof this Decree, shall attempt to contradit} it,
ancl shall not make Amends for his Presumption by condign Satisfattion, his Crime
shall be avenged hy the Punishment of Excommunication. It is our Pleasure how-
ever that such only shall enjoy the ,Defence of this our Protenion, who shall not pre-
stcnre to attempt any ‘Thing to the Subverston of the Christian Faith.

The Papists also farther contend, that although they oblige the chs in
Spain and Portugal to depart thence, unless they embrace the Christian Reli·
gion, yet they do by no Means force them to become Christi-ans ; and there·
fore Osorins and Mariana blame King Enzanuel, who kept the younger Chil-
dren of the Jews against their Parents Will, and compelled the Jews by a
severe Bondage to receive Baptism ·, and they say that this Affion is neither
agreeable to Law or Religion. The Words of Bzovius, by which he blames
this Aetion, under the Year 1497. are not to be omitted here. What is this ἓ

Wouldst thou force rebellious Minds, not bound hy any Obligations of Religion, to -

believe those Things, which they do so vehemently despz'se and rejett ἒ What, do you
a nme this to yonrself, to restain the Liberty of the Will, and throw Chains upon
such unhridled Minds ἓ T his is an Impoffibility, nor doth the most holy Deity of Christ
approve it. What he defires is a voluntary Sacrifico, and not such a one as is for-
ced from Men hy an unlawful Violence 3 nor doth he command that the Mind should
he compelled, hut that the Wilt should he allured and invited to the Stitdy of true Re—
ligion. Bestdes, how can any one arrogate that to himself, which the holy Spirit only
can effebi in their Minds, who do not go on to oppose his Goodness to the End of Life ,Ρ
For ’tis he only who illuminates their Atinas, and allures and invites them, and
brings thoft who do not rejett so great a Gift with an obstinate and ungrateful Heart,
to confeſs and have Communion with Christ. Finally‚ who doth not fiee how unwor-

thy ’tis to commit to Men of different Perstiafions in Religion so many Mysteries, so
