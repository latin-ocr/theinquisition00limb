ed more than three Years under Excommunication. To revenge this Con-
tempt of his Censures, John XXII. prosecuted him for Heresy, as contemn-
ing the Authority of the Church, and her sacred Rites; and commanded
Aycard, Archbishop of Milan, and the Inquifitors of heretical Pravity in
Lombardy, to proceed with all Vigour upon the said Crime of Heresy ·,
who after several Citations, at last pronounccd the definitive Sentence
against him ·, in which, amongst other Crimes this is imputed to him:
That he held erroneous Opinions about the Sacraments, and the Power of the Keys
and Church ·‚ and had fiich an absolute Contempt> of them, that he suffer'd himself
to lie under several Sentences ofExcommunication pronounced against him hoth by Men
and the Law: He caused alst> the Ecclcssastical Interditt, which the said City of
Milan was put under, for the Crimes of Matthew, to be several Times violated,
by ordering the Bodies of dead Laicks to be huried in the Churches, and Church
Yards, with tolling the Bells, even though the Ministers of such Churches were
against it.. He alst) caused the like to he done in thosse Lands and Places, which were
held by his Sons, though put under the like Interditt. At length they pronounce
Sentence against him in these Words ε For thefh and many other Reasons, mo-

and subject him to the Sentence of Excommunicatiom perpetual Infamy, and all other
Penalties appointed, ordained or promulgated against Hereticks ς and order his Peiyon

Dignities, and other Ecclesiastical Benefices, either with Cure or without, and of all
publick Offices and Honours whatsoever, which they are known to poffieſs, and declare

F avourers of Hereticks condemn'd by the Church‚ and punish according to the
Ecclefi-astical Law, all who were convisted of being of his Party, and of the

der’d Raymond Cardonus to gather an Army to chastise the Rebels‚ Several

Cities were taken, and the Viscount routed,- The Senate and people of Agl-⁸·
