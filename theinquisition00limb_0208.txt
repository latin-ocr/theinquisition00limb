The His‘romt of the INQmstho‘N.

do against Heretic—-ks what it would not be lawful for Hereticks to do against
the Church: Which DoChine once assow’d, every one will decide for -h-im-
self, that his is the true Church, and hence claim a Right of persecuting
others, and perswade himself he doth not a& unjustly, even though he
would not allow others to a& so by himself. Thus we see, that Christians
by this idle Dostdne, are. deviated from their original Simplicity and Meek-
ness3 and thatin the room ofmutual Love, by which all the Faithful were-of
one Heart and one SonI, there have succeeded in the Church of Christ, not
only Discords‚ Contentions‚ Hatreds and Enmities‚ but Sl'aughters, and the
worst ofcruel Butcheries. ,

But surely they ought to consider, that theycannot without Injustice, do >to
others what they think it would be unjust iu others to do to thern 3 and that
therefore as they would not themselves be persecuted by others, it must be
unjust in them cruelly to persecute others, even though they think them He-
reticks. For as Salviana, Presbyter of „Marseilles-‚ admirably writes in his Trea·
vise of the Government ofGod, B. 5. p. 150, 151. They are Hereticks‚ but not
willingly. They are Hereticks in our Account, but not in their own. For they

jzsdge themftlves to be so very good Catholicks‚ that they give us the infamous Name of

Hereticks : So that just what we think of them, they think of us. We know they do
an Injury to the only begotten Son of God, because they affirm him to be leſs than the
Fczther. They think we derogato from the Father’s Honour, because we make the Son
eqnal to him. ΕΓ he Truth is with us ·, they imagine it ‘to be with them .· We truly ho-
nour God ς they think that their Opinion is most honourczble to God. ‘Ihey are de-
feflive in the-ir Duty ·, but believe that this is the chief Duty of Religion. They are
Inzpious ; but think it to be true Piety .· Though therefore they err, they err with an
honest Mind, not from Hatred but real Affetflion to God, and believing that they ho·
mur and love the Lord. Though they have not true Faith, they esteem even this to
be the most perseo}t Love of God. How they shall be punifh'd in the Day of Judg-
ment for this Error in Opinion‚ no one knows but the Judge. And therefore 1 think
God patientlybears with them, because he sees that though they do not believe aright,
‘yet that they err from a real Love to Piety and T ruth, &c. But the Minds of Chri-
stians have been perverted from this Branch of Equity through the Preva·
lence of Self-love ·, so that when they could prevail with the Civil Power to
affist them, they have pronounced all that differed from thern Hereticks, and
,then exercised all Kinds of Cruelty against them.
