every Crime, be admitted as VVitneffes, and solicited with Promises and Re-
wards. Befides, who can pretend to form a certain Judgment of mortal En-
mity‚ which lies concealed in the Mind, and of which no Man can therefore
be a certain Judge? The Causes of such Enmity are no absolute Discovery
ofit. One may see some Persons so meek, and so fully possessed with the
Pear osGod‚ as that tho’ they are injured in the most grievous Mamer,
they will not harbour Enmity in their Breast·‚ whilst others, tho’ injured in a
very trisl'ng Manner, year, giving a wrong 'Turn to an indifferent Aetion,
shall conceive an irreconcilable Hatred‚ and cherish a morta} Enmity. Who
can here judge of the MJnd os either? When the Judge hath considered the
Canse of the Enmity‚ if it doth not appear to him to be sufficient, he will
pronounce the Man not to be at mortal Enmity‚ tho’ at the same time his
Mind may burn with Anger and Revenge. And thus he becomes a proper
U'itness, because he is ol a worse Disposition than the Judge dares presume
him to be·, whereby the miserable Wretch‚ who happens to have such an
linemy, perishes by such an Evidence.

V. A fifthlnstance of Injustice is, that if two unexceptionable VVstneffes,
who yet mnst ever be liable to Exception, because unknown to the CriminaL
testify of different Faets, yea, sometimes if there be one only, yea, if but a
mere Report, they think it enough to order to the Torture. Hereby there is
an End at once of the most innocent Person in the Wor'ld, and the Inqui'fitor
bath it in his Power by this Means to make any one guilty by his own pro-
per Confeffion. For how eafily doth it happen, and there are Instances
enough of this in the Court os the Inquifflion, sor a wicked Wretch‚ or an
Enemy to charge an innocent Person with the Crime of Heresy, when he is
certain that he is not obliged* to prove his informatiom and that his Name
shall not be discovered. In the mean while the Person informed against is
condemned to the Torture‚ and without End and Measure tormented with
t'he most cruel Torments, till he makes a Confeffion ofa Crime that he hath
never committed3 which is so evident, that Friar Bernard Deliciofi formerly
said, as appears in his Sentence, That even St. Peter and St. Paul could not de-

fend themselves from Heresy‚ if they were now alive, {f Inquisttion was made against

them according to the Manner used by the Inquifltors.

VI. The fixth is, that two unexceptionable Witnefi'es who agree, are suf-
ficient for the Conviffion and Condemnation of any Person. ’Tis well known
that many Things might be objeffited against the Credit of the Witneffes, i‘f
they were known, by which the Weight of their Evidence might be leffened ;
and that they might be ostentimes convicted of Fallhood by several Circum—
stances, by the Testimony of others present, and by other Means. But who
can defend himself against Persons he doth not know? All that he can do is
to guess and con-jetture who the Accusers and Witneffes are. Ifhe mistakes
in this, all his Defence is in vain. If the Prisoner should happen to guess
right, yet the VVitneffes are never discovered tobim, and he must rnakfe his
