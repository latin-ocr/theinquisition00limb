“ inscription, there is also painted the Mark which is usually put on living
“ Penitents, as is above explained. In the antient Cloaths, which have not
“ yet been repaired, one may see an upriglzt crois. Belides these already
‘⁶ mentioned, other Things may be seen in them ·, for in some the Person and
“ Crime is omitted, and this one word only written without the Pietate,
‘³ Comhustzts, Burni. On the Cloaths ofsuch as are reconciled, this &Vord on-
“ ly without any Cross or Mark, Reconciliatus, Reconciled. Sometimes the
“ Date of the Year is wanting. Sometimes the Flames are painted without
“ any Inscription, so that the Crimina] can't poffibly be known. Some
“· Cloaths are to be seen, from the Ends of which the Threads hang out, in
‘⁶ which probably there is nothing remarkable, and which seem to be made
“ ofthe very End of the Piece. The Cause of so great a Variety in these
“ Cloaths seems to be this, that formerly the Fathers ol the holy Inquifition
“ did not publilh Constitutions concerning all these Matters, as they have
“ now done. For after that the Instructions of the Inquifitors were printed
at Madrid‚ there is extant a peculiar Constitution‚ in which the Manner of
“ fixing up, and keeping in Repair these Cloaths of Infamy is prescribed.
“ 'Tis decreedin this manner, Cap. 81. ’Tis known, that the Monuments of
“ Infamy of condemned Persam, both living, whether present or absent, or
“ dead, must be hung up on the Walls of the Churches of the Parifhes where
“ they lived; and that whether they are imprisbned, or deceased, or ssed,
“ ’Τίς the same as to reconciled Perstms, after having performed the Persem-
“ ces injcined them, and the taking off their Habits, even altho’ they were
“ cloathed in them only for the Proceffion at the Λᾶ of Faith, and wseigff
“ their Sentences were read over. This is inviolably observed‚ and no one
“ hath Power to make any Alteration herein 3 but 'tis always recomnicnded
“ to the Inquifitors‚ that they should take diligent Care to repair these Effi-
“ gies, especially in the Provinces which they visit, that the Infamy ofHe-
“ reticks and their Posterity may never be forgotten. The Time also oft
“ Condemnation must- be written on these Cloaths, and it must be particularly
“ specified, whether they offended as Jews, Saracem, Lutherans, and embra·
“ ced the Herefiesoftheir Followers and other impious Persons. However,
“ these Monuments of Infamy and Disgrace are not to be fixed up to render
‘⁶ those inf-amous, who are reconciled during the Time of Indulgence aad
“ Grace. For as it was agreed with them, that they should not wear such in-
“ famous Habits‚ nor be cloathed with them during the Time of their Re-
“conciliation, it would be contrary to Reason and Justice to hang them up3
“ because it would be wholly to destroy the Favour granted them. This
“ Constitution is observed in all the Kingdoms and Dominions of the King of
“ Spain, excep: in Sicily 3 where, in the Year 1543. when the Licentiate Cer-
“ vera was Inquisitor there, there was avery great Commotion at PalermJ,
“ when the People rose against the holy Inquifiti0n‚ and tore offthe infa-
“ mous Cloaths from the W'alls of the Church dedicated to St. Dominick, with -
“ so great a Fury and Rage, that they could never, to this Day‚ fix thern up >
