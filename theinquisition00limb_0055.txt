’'s-is natural here to observe, that the Anathema’s and Depofitions agreed
on by this Coum-il, and confirmed» by the imperial Authority, were the be-
ginning of all the Persecutions that afterwards raged against each Party in their
Turns. As the Civil Power had now taken part in the Controverfies about
Religion, by authorismg the Dominion os tae Bishops over the Consciences of
others, enforcing their Ecclefiastical Constitutions‚ and commanding the uni-
versal Reception of that Faith they had decreed to be Orthod0x‚ it was easy to
foresee that those who opposed them would employ the same Arts ancl Autho-
*rity to establish their own faith and Power, and to oppress their Enemies‚ the
firss favourable Opportunity that presented: And this the Event abundantly
made good. And indeed how should it be otherwise? For Doctrinae, that are ’
determined merely by dint of Numbers, and the Awes of worldly Power, car-
ry no manner ofiConvietion in them, and are not likely therefore to be be-
lieved on these Accounts by those who have once opposed them. And as such
Methods osdeciding Controversies equally suit all Principles‚ 2the introducing
them by any Party gives but too plausible a Pretence to every Party, when
uppermost‚ to use rhem in its turn 3 ancl though they may agree well enough
with the Views of spiritual Ambition‚ yet they can be of no Service in the
World to the Interest oftrue Religion, because they are direffitly contrary to the
Nature and Spirit of it ς and because Arguments, which equally prove the Truth γ
and Excellency of all principles, cannot in the least prove the Truth os any. .

If one may form a Judgment os the Persons who composed this Council,
from the small Accounts we have lest os them, they do not, Ithink‚ appear
to have met so much with a Defign. imparrially to debate on the Subjecfts in
Controversy, as to establish their own Authority and Opinions, and oppress
theirEnem'ieS. For besides what heth been already observed concerning their
'I'emper and Qualifications, Theodori} informs us, that when those-os the Arian Ε. H-
Party proposed in writPng tothe Synod the Form os Faith they had drawn up, ¹- ¹· c.7.
the Bissiops os the Orthodox fide no sooner read it but they gravely tore it in
pieces, and called it a spurious and false confeffion ·, and after they had filled
the Place with Noise and Confufion, universally accused them os betraying the
Doaeftrine according to Godliness. Doth such a Method of Proceeding suit ve-
ry well wirh the Charafter osa Synod inspired‚ as the good Emperor declared‚
by the Holy Ghost? Is Truth and Error to be decidedby Noise and. Tumult?
VVas this the VVay to convince Gainsayers, and reconcile them to the. Unity of
the Faith? Or could it be imagined, that the diffatisfied Part ofthis venerableAs-
sembly would acquiesce in the tyrannical Determination of such a-Majotity, and
patiently submit toExcommunicatiomDepofition, and-theCondemnation ot their
Opinions, almost unheard‚ and altogether unexamin'd ? Howjustly doth the Cen-
sure pass‘edby Gregory Nazianzen upon the Councils that were held in his Time iol-*13
agree to this famous one os Nice? If, says he, I must speak τιθεῖ ruth, this is mv ch‘olu- “W- '‘¹'’
