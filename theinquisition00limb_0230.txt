sometimes the Peopie. Such of them as engaged in this VVork they figned
with the Cross, and encouraged them in their Expeditions against Hereticks.
Farther than this, Dominick, who was of a bloody fierce Temper4 that he
might the more effeetually extirpate all Heresy, invented a Method, how,
under the Appearance of Mercy and Tenderness‚ he might exercise the most
outragious Cruesty, viz. the laying some certain Punishments‚ by way of
wholsome Pennmoe, upon such as were converted to the Roman Faith, that
being thus converted‚ they might be freed from Excommunication. For
what could carry a greater Appearance of Mercy, than to absolve and re-
ceive into Communion, those Hereticks that returned to the Churc'n⁵ and vo»
luntarily subjeeted themselves to a wholsome Penance? But the Truth is,
that this was the Height of Cruelty : For they submitted to such Penances,
not from Conviffion and Choice‚ but for sear of a more terrible Punishment.
For the Fire and Faggot and other Punishments were ready prepared for such
as were not converted ·, and all that refused to submit to these PenanceS‚ were
pronouneed excommunicate, convist, and obstinate Hereticks, and as such
turned over to be puniihed by the Secular Court. Befides, these wholsome
Penances were attended with the greatest Miseries to the Penitents ·, for either
they were condemned to perpetual Imprisonment‚ there to wear out a wretch-
ed Life with the Bread and Water of Affiiffion, or were marked on their Back
and Breast with Cmffes, that by these Marks of Infamy, they might be ex-
posed to the Reproaches and Abuses of all Men 3 and were withal publickly
whipped before the People, either in the open Street‚ or in the Church, and
commanded many other Things, under the specious Name of Penance ; that
by this Severity, which the Penitents were forced voluntarily to submit to,
that there might be an Appearance of Mercy in their Case‚ all others might
be deterred from Heresy.

N the mean while the Pope‚ being intent on the ExtIrpation of Hereticks‚

I excited all the Princes‚ that they should not yield thern any Refuge in their
Dominions, but oppress them with all their F orce. His principal Care was
to expel th em from the Country of Tholouse‚ where the Albigenses were very nu-
merous. He was perpetually preffing Raymond Earl of Tholouse to banish them
from his Dominions ·‚ and when he could not prevail with him, either to drive
out so large a Number of Men, or to persecute them, he ordered him to be ex-
»communicated as a F avoxirer of Hereticks. He also sent his Legate‚ with
Letters to many of the PrelatcS, coznrnanding them to make Inquifition agairkst
