ing all these Things, when Alexander gives an Account of the Principles of

to draw from them, and charges him with holding, that the Son was made.

like every other Creature absolutely out ofnothing‚ and that therefore his Na*

ture was mutable, and susceptive equally of Virtue and Vice3 with many

other invidious and unseriptural DoCtrines, which Arius plainly appears not to

have maintained or taught.

But as ’tis the common Fare of religious Disputes to be managed with an
intemperate Heat, ’tis no wonder the Disputants {hould mist-ake each other, or
in their Warmth charge one another with Conl‘equences which either they do
not see, or expressy deny. Whilst this is the Case the Controversy can never
be fairly managed, nor brought to a friendly 'and peaceable Iffue. Many Me-
thods were tried, but all in vain, to bring Alexander and Arius to a Reconcili—
ation‚ the Emperor himself condescending to become a Mediator between
them.

The first Step he took to heal this Breach was right and prudent: He sentEustb.Vir;
his Letters to Alexandria, exhorting Alexander and Arius to lay afide their Dif- Const. 1. ι.
ferences, and become reconciled to each other. He tells them, That after he ⁰· ⁶3›&⁶·
had diligently exatnined the Κῷ and Progreſs of this Affaz'r, he found the Occaston of
the Difference to be very trifling, and not worthy such furious Contention53 and that
therefore he promised himself that his Mediation between them for Peace would have
the defired EffeH. He tells Alexander, T hat he required from his Prcstyters a De·
claration of their Senlirnents concerning a stlly, empty Qestion. And Arius, That he
had imprudently altered what he should not have even thought of, or what at least he
ought to have kept secret in his own Breast ·‚ and that therefore Qcstions about such
Things should not have been (sted3 or if they had, should not have been answered;
that they proceeded from an idle Itch of Disputation, and were in themselves 'of so high
and dtfficult a Nature, as that they could not he exaffly comprehended‚ or suitably ex-
plained3 and that to infist on such Points too much before the People, could
produce no other Effe& than to make some of thern talk Blasphemy, and
others turn Schismaticks ; and that therefore as they did not contend about any
effential Dottrine of the Gospel, nor introduce any new Heresy concerning the W‘otfhip
ofGod, they should again communicate with each other ; and finally, that not·
withstanding their Sentiments in these unneceffary and trifling Matters were
different from each other, they should acknowledge one another as Brethren,

apd, l{ay-ing afide their Hatreds, return to a firmet· Friendlhip and Affection
t an e ore.

But religious Hatreds are not so easily removed, and the Ecclefiastical
Combatants were too warmly engaged to follow this kind and wholesome Ad·
