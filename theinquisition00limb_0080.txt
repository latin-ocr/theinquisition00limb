The INTnonucrxon.

‘1⁵2ng- l. 5· Justin the younger, who succeedecl Justinian, publllhed an Edi& soon after his

Advancemenr‚ by which he sent all Bishops to their respefflve Sees, and to per-
form divine Worffiip according to the usual Manner of their ChurcheS, without
making any Innovations concerning the Faith. As to his persona] Charaeten
he was extremely dissolute, and debauched, and addieted to the most vile and
criminal Pleasures. He was also sordidly Covetous, and sold the very Bi-
ssmpricks to the best Bidders, putring them up to publick Audlion. Nor was
he less remarkable for his Cruelty : He had a near Relation of his own Name,
whom he treacheroussy murthered‚ and of whom he was so jealous‚ that he
could not be content till he and his Empress had trampled his Head under their
Feet. However, he was very Orthodox, and published a new Explication of
the Faith, which for Clearness and Subtlety exceeded all that went before it.
In this he profeffes, Thar he believed in Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the Con-
substantial Trinity, -one Deity, or Nature, or Effi’nce, in one Virtue, Power and
Energy, in three Hypostases or Persons ·‚ and that he adored the Unity in Trinity, and
the Trinity in Unity, having a molt admirable Difference and Union; the Unity ac-
cording to the Effi’nce or Deity 3 the Trinity according to the Properties, Hypostases or
Persbns ς for they are divided indivistbly ·, or if I may β) speak, they are joined toge-
ther separately. ‘she Godhead in the ‘I‘hree is One, and the ‘Ihree are One, the Deity
being in them ·, or to speak more accurately, the ‘Ihree are the Deity, God the Pather,
God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, each Person being considered by itself, the Mind
thus separating Things inseparable ·, the Three being understood to be together God, be-
ing one in Operation and Nature. We believe also in one only begotten Son of God, the
bVord ————- for the Holy Trinity receives no Addition of a fourth Person, even after
the Incarnation of God the Word, one of the holy Trinity. But our Lord Jesus Christ
is one and the same, Consubstantial to God, even the Father, according to his Deity,
and Consubstantial to us according to his Manhood. He suffered in the Flefh, but was
impaffible in the Deity. For we do not own that God the Word who wrought the Mi-
racles was one, and he that suffered another ·, but we confess that our Lord Jesus
Christ, the Word of God, was one and the same, who was made Flefh and became
perfec‘t Man·‚ and that the Miracles and Sufferings were of one and the same : For it
was not a Man that gave himself for us, but God the Word himself, being made Man
without change 3 so that when we confess our Lord Jesus Christ to be one and the same,
compounded of each Nature, of the Godhead ancl Manhood, we do not introduce any
Confusion or Mixture by the Union for as God remains in the Manhood, so also
nevertheless doth the Man, being in the Excellency of the Deity, Emanuel being both
in one and the firme, even one God and also Man. And when we confess him to be per-
fett in the Godhead, and persea in the Manhood, of which he is compounded, we
don‘t introduce a Divifion in part, or Settion to his one compounded Person, but only
fignify the Difference of the Natures, which is not taken away by the Union 3 for the
*divine Nature is not converted into the human, nor the human Nature changed into the
divine. But we fizy, that each being confidered, or rather attually existing in the very
Definition or Reason of its proper Nature, constitute the Oneness in Perfhn. Now this
Oneness as to Person fignifies that God the Word, i. e. one Person of the three Persons
Of the Godhead was not united to a pre-existent Man, but that he formed to himseffZn
