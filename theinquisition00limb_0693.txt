this the Inquifitor and Vicars of the Bishop of Tholouse called a Council

on the following Tuqsday, and at length it was concluded, that on the follow-

Converfion was real or pretended ·, and so striffly kept, that she might not

be able to infe& others with her Errors. Eymerick also gives us an Instance ac„ ,Α
Barcelona in Catalonia‚ os three Hereticks impenitent, but not relapsed‚ who '‘Q‘'
were delivered over to the secular Arm. And when one of them, who was

a Priest, was put in the Fire‚ and one of his Sides somewhat burm, he cried

to be taken out of it, because he would abjure and repent. And he was ta-
ken out accordingly. But he was afterwards found always to have continbed

in his Heresy, and to have infe&ed many, and would not be converted, and
was therefore turn'd over again as impenitent and relapsed, to the secular Arm,

and burnt.

'lahe Author of the History of the Inquifition at (ἶσα, gives us another In-cap, 38. s
stance of a very rich new Christian, whose Name was Lewz's Pezoa, who, with
his whole Family, had been- accused of secret Judaistn, by some of his Ene-
mies, and wh0, with his wife, two Sons and one Daughter, and some other
Relations that lived with him, were all thrown into the Jayl of the Inqujfition,
He denied the Crime of which he was accused, and well refuted it, and de-
manded that the 'Witneffes who had deposed against him, might be discove-
red to him, that he. might convici: them of Falshood. But he could obtain
nothing, and was condemned as a Negative, to be delivered over to the Arm
of the secular Court ὅ which Sentence was made known to him fifteen Days be-
fore it was pronounced. The Duke of (iada-val, an intimate Friend of the,
Duke d'A-veira, Inquifitor General, had made strist Enquiry how his Affair-
was like to turn. And understanding by the Inquifitor General, that un-
less he confeffed before his going out of Prison, he could not escape the F ire,
because he had been legally convisted', he continued to intreat the Inquifitor
General, till he had obtained a Promise from him, that if he could persuade
Pezoa to confess, even after Sentence pronounced, and his Proceffion in the
Aet ofFaith, he should not die, tho' it was contrary t0 the Laws and Custom
of an A& of Faith. Upon that solemn Day therefore, on which the A& of
Faith was to be held, he went with some of his own Friends, and some that were
Pezoa’S, to the Gate of the Inquifition, to prevail with him, if poffible, to
confesS. He came out in the Proceffion, wearing the infamous Samarre‚ and
on his Head the Casroch, or infamous Mitre. His Friends, with many Tears,
besought him in the Name ofthe Duke de Cadaval, and by all that was dear
to him, that he would preserve his Life, and intimated to him, that if he
would confess and repent, the said Duke had obtained his Life from the lnqui-
fitor General, and would give him more than he had lost. But all in vain„
Pezoa continually protesting himself innocent, and that the Crime it sels was
falssy invented by his Enemies who fought his Destrudtion. When the Pro-
ceffion was ended, and the A& of Faith almost finished, the Sentences of those

who were condemned? to certain Penances having been read, and on the Apkg
prone .
