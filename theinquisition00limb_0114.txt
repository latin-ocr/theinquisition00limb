tered into their Hearts whilst [116)1 were triumphant in Power, and which mo-
thing but a sense of [11611 own extreme Danger seems then to 'nave extorted
from* them: Tlie Diffenters‚ far from following [11611 3616111106οῑ5, 1636111γ
entered into all Mearm-es with [11601 for [116 common Sufety‚ and were amongst
the first and licartiest Friends ofthe Revolution, under King Wic'liasn 111. of
glor-ioris and immortal Memory.

80011 after the Settlement of this Prinee upon the Throne‚ 311 A& was paffed

11161 with the same Fate as [116 former: So that though the Dilienters were

and several Atten-›pts were made to disturb and prosecute them in this Reign,
but were prevented from takirg Effec‘lt by rnyal InjunCtions.
