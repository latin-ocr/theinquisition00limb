The Hisronv ofthe INQUISITION. ¹3

‘f petus, whom he tired out with repeated Injuries. And because he did not
“ think the Governors of the Provinces sufficient for the Punilhment of Here-
“ ticks, he went to Constantinople to solicite new Edi& from the Magistrates.

Nor were the Bishops of Rome afraid to implore the Affistance of the Empe· eimanag
rors against Hereticks. Pope Anastafius perswaded the Judges to condemn the tit· 49.
,Manicheam to perpetual Banishment, whom he could not bring over [ο the§·14·
Catholici< F aith 3 lest by their Contagion they should infe& the holy Flock.
And Leo the Great, writing to Leo the Emperor, says: That the perverse
and enfimring Dzsputations of the Heretieks would sbon come to an End, if put un-
der Restmint by the Imperial Po-wer. And in his 43d Epistle to the same Prince z
Vouchstzfe, by your Regard for the Faith, to yield this Remedy to the Church 3 that
Hereticks may not only be kept out of all holy Orders, hut even expelled from every
city, that the holy People of God may he in no farther Danger of Infeinon from
theſs? wicked Men. And in his 45th Epistle, he exhorts the Empress Pulcheria,
wat she would banish Eutyches further from Constantinople, that he might re-
ceive no Comfort from those whom he had drawn over to his Impiety.

But further, when they had got into Poffeffion of the supreme Power in
Rome, they were ostentimes the Authors of Persecution themselves. Pope
Celestine, as Socrates relates in his Ecclefiastical History, b. 7. c. 11. ‘⁶ took
“ from the Novatians their Churches in Rome, so· that Rusticula, their Bishop‚
‘⁴ was forced ⁴to meet his Flock in private Houses: For till this Time the
“ Novatiansflourished in Rome, were in Poffeffion of many ChurcheS‚ and
“ had large Congregations to fill them; but they fell a Sacrifice to Envy,
‘⁶ because, T he szhops both of Rome and Alexandria had usurped a tyrannia-al (N. L)
‘⁴ Power, exceeding all the Bounds of the Pricsthood. > For this Reasonrthe Bish ops
“ of Rome did not permit even those who-agreed with themselves in Opi-
“ nion, to hold free and· open Affemblies -; but though they praised them for
“their Agreement with them-in* «the Faith‚ yet deprived them of all thesi·
“ Substance. But the Bissmps of Constantinople were however free from -this
‘⁶ wicked Spirit ; <for-*they not only suffered the Novatians to meet within the
‘⁵ City‚ but even bore them a very fincere'Affeffion.” But the Bishops of
Rome, even when theyshad no Power at Constantinople, yet by their perpe-
tual Solicitations of the Emperors there, at last extort'ed from them the Op·
pgeffion of Hereticks. Whilst Justim'an was Emperor, the Followers of An-
thimus and Severus held their publick Afl‘emblies, although they had been ¹
condemned and excommunicated by the Pope of Rome. NVherefore the Bishops
of, 'the Second Syria, and the Archimandrites and Monks, sent Letters to Agapetus,
Bishop of Rome, then at Constantinople, inwhich they besought him to deliver
them from Hereticks. The Bishops thus: ‘T ake from us speedily these evil Men,
and offer up this acceptable Sacrifice to God and our Saviour, that we ma)- have a
good Account to give in the future awful Judgment. Preserve the Ecclesiastical Dig-
