Nor is there any Regard to Kindred in this Affair. For the Brother is
bound under the same Penalty to accuse his Brother, yea, the Wife her Hus-
band‚ and the Husband his Wise, if guilty, or suspected of Heresy. Pegna Djmqg
however thinks, that the Wife is to be excused, if she doth not accuse herpart- z:

F ellow, and she is afraid of ill Usage from him. In all other Cases he thinks
the Wife is obliged to accuse her Husband.

[Ludovicus a Paramo tells us, that Lewis de Carvajal, altho’ Governor andl. ι. ε, 2.
Captain General of the Province of Tampico and Pamic0, was forced to walkc- 21.
out in publick Penance, because'he did not denounce four Women, whom ¹⁶¹³
were secretly Jews, and to whom he was Uncle ς and that tho’ a little be-

’Tis disputed amongst the Popish Doe'tors, whether a Son be obliged to Simane.
accuse his F ather, who is a secret Heretick, or at least to discover him tode casm.
the Judges. The general Opinion is, that he is obliged to it. But others snst·²¹'· ,
think differently, because there is no Law, natural, divine, ‘or human, thatssessgf' ἶς’
‘lays such a Burthen on the Shoulders of Children. And yet even such who ’
are of this Opinion, confess the Son may do it, especially if the F ather be
incorrigible. Yea, think such a Son ought to be commended who conquers
his natural Love, and overcomes this most strong Affestion, srom an ardent
Love to divine Religion. He must however try every Method before he ac-
cuses his F ather to the Judge. But yet they teach, that there are two Cases ’
in which the Son is obliged to betray his heretical F ather to the Judges.

The first, when the Son is legally interrogated by the Apostolick Inquisitors·;
the second, when the F ather's Heresy is dangerous to the Common·wealth.

Pegna however affirms, that the Son ought to accuse and denounce before tn Eymen:
the Inquifitors‚ his Father, whom he knows to be an Heretick. The Re-pare.2.
ward of suchAccusation is, that the Son who thus aeis, is ‘freed from thecam. ¹5·
Penalties ordained against the Children of Hereticks, according to the Law
of the Emperor Frederick. Nor do we think proper to exclude from ,the Bounds of
Mercy suqh, who not following the Heresp of their Fathers, fhall distover their secret
chedness ς sothat in what manner soever the Father's Guilt he punishcd, let not
the Innocence of their Children be suhjeH to the aforesaid Pumfhment, Caremz addS,

that not only an heretical Father, but even one only suspeeted of Heresy,
must be accused by the Son to the Inquifitors‚ because the same Reasons hold
good as to Hereticks, and those suspeeted of Heresy. ’

An Heretick also reformed, according to Royas, ought necessarily to bennaz-
accused before the Inquifitors of the Faith3 because they often feign them-Affert. 30
selves to be corrected and amended, and in the mean while infect with their
D0&rinei1nwary Catholicks. And altho’ such Hereticks should be really
resormed, 'tis-nevertheless useful and neceffary to accuse them, that the In-

quifitors of the Faith may interrogaui:³ them from what Masters they learnt
