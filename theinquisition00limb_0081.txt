out of her, in his own Person, Flefh consubstantiat to us, and liahle to all the same
Paffions, without Sin, animated with a reasonable and intellettual Soul. For con-
stdering his inexplicahle Oneneſs, we orthodoxly confeſs one Nature of God the Word
made Flefh, and yet conceiving in our Minds the Difference of the Natures, we say
they are twa, not introducing any Manner of Division. For each Nature is in him,

stasts, God and Man together. Moreover, we anathematize all who have, or do
think otherwise, and judge them as cut off from the holy Catholick, and apostolick
Church of God. To this extraordinary Edicit, all, says the Historian, gave
their Consent, esteeming it to be very Orthodox, though they were not more
united amongst themselves than before.

binding and loofing was delivered to Peter and his Suceffors, and not to the Bi-
shops of Constantinople ς admonishing him to take care, that he did not provoke
the Anger of God against himself, by raifing Tumults in his Church. This
Pope was the first who stiled himself, Servus Servorum Dei, Servant of the Ser·

prevailed with Phocas, who murthered Mauritius the Emperor, to declare,¹¹¹·
that the See of the bleffed Apostle Peter, which is the Head of all Churches,
should be so called and accounted by all, and the Bilhop of it Oecumenical or
universal Bissmp. The Church of Constantinople had claimed this Precedence
and Dignity, and was sometimes favoured herein by the Emperors, who de-
clared, that the first See ought to be in that Place which was the Head of the
Empire. The Roman Pontiffs, on the other hand, affirmed, that Rome, of
which Constantinople was but a Colony, ought to be esteemed the Head of the
Empire, because the Greeks themselves, in their Writings, stile the Emperor,
Roman Emperor, and the Inhabitants of Constantinople are called Romans and
not Greeks ·, not to mention, that Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, gave the
Keys of the Kingdom ot Heaven to his Successors, the Popes os Rome. On
this Foundation was the Superiority of the Church of Rome to that of all other
Churches built ; and Phocas, who was guilty of al] Villanies, was one of the
fittest Persons that could be found to gratify Boniface in this Request. Boniface
also called a Council at Rome, where this Supremacy was confirmed, and by
whom it was decreed, that Bishops should be chosen by the Clergy and Pe0p1e‚
