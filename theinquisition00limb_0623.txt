Religion, altho’ the Criminal should deny his Intention, he will find his
Judges to be cruel‚ and void ofMercy, and that they will put him to the
Torture at Pleasure‚ that by the Severity of his 'l'orments they may force
from him a Confeffion of his Intention.

C H A P. XXIII.

How the IN (ψ 1 s 1 T o R may be rejee‘led.

H E R E are other Exceptions against the Judge himself, and those are Direef.

T principally tWO‚ the first is the Refusal ofthe Inquifitor. This Refusalp-3·n·1²0·

is sometimes reasonable and just, sometimes frivolous and void. But in this

Tribunal many CauseS‚ which are sufficient to set as1de other Judges, are not

admitted, but only these, Enmities, Conspiracy against the Criminals, or

something like it, as a grievous Contention, whence Enmity may easily arise.

, Leffer Causes are never allowed. Or if the Inquifitor hath dealt hardly by the
Criminal, contrary to the common Course of the Law. If the Inquifitor ap·
prehends that the accused Person will refuse him upon this latter Account, he

made stffnds good. If such Rejefflon be presented to the Inquifitor, phe may
amend his Mistake‚ and reduce the Process to the Condition it was in, before
the Iniury complained of 3 and thus the Grievance being removed, the Reason
of Suspicion ceases, and the Refusal of the Inquifitor becomes void.

If he rejects him as an Enemy, or as a Friend of his Enemy or Accuser, com. 30.

Eymerick is of opinion, that the Matter must be left to Arbitrators to deter-
mine it. But now the Reason of such Refusal must be remitted to the su-
pream Senate of the Inquifition‚ that the Affair being summarily taken Cogni-
sance of, the Inquifitor refused may be rejested‚ or prohibited to judge in that
Cause‚ or on the contrary may be commanded to proceed. This is determi-
ned by the Madrid Instruffion, An. 1561. c. 52. If any one of the Inquisitors

fhall be refused by any Criminal, if ficch Inquifitor hath a Colleague on the Spot, he
must then abstain from the Cognisance officch Cause‚ and certify the Senate of the Mat-
ter, and in the mean while let his Colleague proceed. If he bath no Colleague‚ let
him in like manner certzfy the Semne, and not proceed in the Cause‚ ’till the Senate

shall decree what ought to be tione, after having seen and examined the Reafims of
the Suspicion. Thesame must be done when all the Inquffitors are rejee‘led.
