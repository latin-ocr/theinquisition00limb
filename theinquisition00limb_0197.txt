The HISTORY ofthe INQUISITlom

am I afflitted and grieved fhr these Things ἓ And afterwards, citing that place
of St. Paul, 2 Tim. ii. 24, 25, 26. The Servant of the Lord must not strive, but
he gentle, &c. he goes on: Entice him with the Bait of Compaffion‚ and thus en-
deavour to draw him out from Destruttiom that being thus delivered from the Infettion
of his former Error, he may live, and thou may’st deliver thy Soul. But if he obsti..
nately refufhs to hear, witneſs against him, lest thou become guilty 3 only let it he
with Long—suffering and Gentlencss‚ lest the Judge require his Soul at thy Hand.
Let him not be hated, fhnnn'd, or perstczeted‚ bat exercise towards him a stn-
cere and fervent Charity. And at length he thus concludes .· Impious and
heretical Principles are to be opposed and anathematized ; hut Men themselves
arev to be spared, and we must pray for their Salvation. If this was his Opinion
as to those who anathematised others only upon the Account of Heresy, how
zealous would he have been against such, who, not content to pronounce
Hereticks accursed‚ deliver thern over to the secular Arm to be most cruelly
unished ?

P He farther declares his Opinion, in his eighth Homily on the first of Genests .-
Hereticks may be compared to Persons in aDisease‚ and that are almost deprived of their
sight ·, for as the one cannot bear the Light of the Scin thro’ the Weakness of their Eye5‚
and the other thro' Jtlmss nauſseate the most wholsome Food ; so they being distemper’d
in their Minds‚ and darknecl in their Underst'anding‚ cannot endure to behold the
Light of Truth. W'e ought therefore, in Disiharge of our Duty, to hold out the helping
Hand, and speak to them with great Meekneſs. For thus St. Paul hath advfid, say-
ing, That our Adversaries are to be iiistruc‘ted with Gendeness, ifperadventure God
may give them Repentance‚ to the Acknowledgment of the T ruth, and that they may
escape out of the Snare of the Devil‚ having been taken captive by him at his Will -.
Jo that there is need of a double Measure of Gentleneſs and Forbmranoe, to deliver
and bring them out of the Snares of the Devil. But in his 47th Homily upon
Matt. xiii. explaining the Parable of the Tares, he doth not condemn all
Sorts of externa] Violence against Hereticks : Wlt thou therefore that we go
and gather them up ? But the Lord forbad it, lest alst) ye pluck ap the Wheat with
the T ares 3 which he said to prevent Wars, and Effufion of Blood‚ and Slaaghter.
For if Hereticks were to be killed, a bloody and eternal War would spread it self thro'
the World. And therefore he forbids it on a double Account 3 the one, that the Wheat
might not be burnt 3 the other, that unless they were healed, they could not escape the
severcst Punifhment. Therefhre, if you would punish them, and not burt the Corn, you
must wait for the proper Time and Season. What then doth he mean when he says, lest
alst) ye pluck up the Wheat ἓ Undoubtedly this, that if you take up Arms, you mast
neceffarily destroy many of the Saints with the Hereticks 3 or that even finnt Of theſs?
may be changed into the true Wheat .· If therefore you too hastily plan& them up,
⁴you will destroy all that good When, which might have been> prodaced out of the
very Tares, But he doth not forbid us to confine, or shut the Mntths Of Herelic‘kss
or to hinder their Liberty ofSpeech‚ or synodical Aſjemblies‚ ar prevent their Union‚
but only to murder and destrogo them.

St.Jerome is of the sameMind, who in his 62d Lecter to Theophilus againstJohu

qf Jerusalem, thus speaks : The Chnrch of Christ was founded on the bloedy Snffi'rffi}
