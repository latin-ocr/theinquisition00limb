nitent and Relapsed. Urban IV. in order to remove this Difficulty, A. D.
1263. created by a Rescripr, beginning, Cupientes, the Cardinal of St. Aiehc-
las in carcere Tulliano, Inquisitor General, or, as it were, Protector of the In«
quifitors, whom particular Inquisitors might consult, either in Person, or by
propoling their Doubts to him by Letters. But now all these inconveniences
are over, fince the Appointment of the Cardinals Inquisitors Gener-al over
Christendom, whom they may consult by Letters, and to whom all Princes
are subject in this Affair. This is plain from the Bull of Pius V. publiihed
1566. In Spain the Inquifitors of particular Cities consult the Inquisitor Ge-
neral of those Kingdoms, or Prefident of the Inquisition3 and he with those
of other Provinces advises with the Cardinals Inquifitors General.

’Tis however now the constant daily PraCtice of all Inquisitors to have their
Vicars General, wh0‚ in their Absence, may manage the Affairs of the Inquisi-
tion. These areordinarily appointed by the Inquisitors themselve53 for the ln-
quisitor hath Power of constituting his Vicar or Commissary, by the Bull of
Clement VII. sent to Paulus Bugitella, which begins, Cum ficut, in which we Q· 13³¹
read : Moreover we decree that you may have Authority to appoint your Vzcars or
Commiſjaries, Persam whom you shall judge to be circumspeo‘l, fit, and proper, pro-
vided they are full thirty Y ears of Age.

This Power doth not extend only to the appointing one or two Vicars or pegma,
Commiffaries, but several, if the Diocese or Province be large, and contains com. <53²⁴
several Cities. For as the inquisitor cannot be personally present at all of
them, 'tis necessary he should appoint Commiffaries in them, He must create
at least in every City one, a Man prudent and learned, an old Christian, pious,
and fit for Business‚ a religious Person of his own, or some other Order, or a.
secular Clergyman, viz. one possessed of some Prefermentin the principa] Church
of that City, or a Canonist, whom he verily believes will take Care of the
Matters of the F aith diligently, and according to the Canonical Sanffions.
