Fine, or to Banistrment, or the Piilory, or to be whipped, and, if the Na}
ture of the Crirne requires it, to the Gallies.

If the Witneffes are evidently caught in a Falshood, they may be punished
by the inquisitor, according to their Merits. He Is accounted a false Wit—
ness who tells a Lie, by depofing a Fallhood, and who suppreffes or conceals
the Truth. And if the Inquifitor finds any Witness to be manifestly false,
he, together with the Bishop, may punish him. Thus ’tis provided by a

2 Μ’ certain Rescript ofLeo X. An. 1520. in which there are many Rules for the-

Observation of the Inquifitors of the Kingdorn of Arragan, and, amongst
others, this which Ι have mentioned. And that if any Witnessfhalldepose a
Falfhood in the said Office of the Inqmfhion, he shall be punished hy the Eccleliastical.
Juclgffl, the Ordinarics of the Diocefi‘ in which such Faiffioodfhall be committed, and‘
hy the Inquisitcrs of the said Pravity, deputed together, for the Time being, in the
fiime Diocesc, so that the one shall not he able to proceed without the other.

Exmerick mentions a Case, which happened at Tholouse, An. 1312. that a

3·Father accused his Son of the Crime of heretica] Pravity, and afterwards re-
2'tra6ted it. His Sentence may be seen in the Book of the Sentences of the-—

Theious} Inquisition, fol. 42. TheDostors however think, that as there is nov
Law extant concerning this Matter, such a one ought not to be delivered to
the secular Court, but that his Life ought in Mercy to be granted to him.
But Leo X. by a Bull directed to Cardinal Adrian, Inquifitor General of'Spain,
An. 1518. granted full Power of condemning to whatever Punilhments the-
Inquifitor should think proper, and of delivering or turning over to the secu-
lar Court, without any Fcar of any Ecclefiastical Punishment or Censure, or
Mark of Irregularity, att aad fingular Perstms of every State, Degree, Order,
Dignity and Condition, who, in the Crime of Heresy, shall be legally provedto have
kaowingly given false thess, or to have inducea' any other to do so, or to conceal the ·
fruth, or to have killed any one for giving true Evidence, or false Evidence not pro—
ved fh, or to have maimeal him in any Mmher, or to have deprived him, or caused
him to he deprived of all, or the greatest Part of his Effec‘t'53 which they believe-

and punished with Death, as a Negative and Impenitent, upon account of
their Evidence. But when any false Witness voluntarily accuses himself, and
asks for Mercy before the Person he gave Evidence against is delivered ovet·
to the secular Court, and put to Death, they think he ought to be spared‚ and
his Life given him, but that he ought to suffer some very grievous Penance.
Thus they acted in that Instance of Tholouse, with Pontius Arnaldi‚ a false
WVitness against his Son, in the Crime of Heresy, acknowledging his Fault,
and craving the Mercy of the Inquifitor, who was condemned to perpetual-g
Imprisonment‚ in which, during Life, he was to do wholesome Penance, with
the Bread of Grief, and the Watcr of Affliction ·, and befides this, to stand
publickly, so as to be openly seen and known by all By-standers, upon an

’ high Ladder‚ before the Door ofthe Cathedral.Church of St. Stephea, the
