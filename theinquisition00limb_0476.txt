The HISTORY of the INQmsiTtoN.

vourers of thern ·, but not ii these Omiffions proceed from Negligence3 or any
other Cause. Secondly, the Magistrate is a Favourer of Hereticks by
Commiffion. If, when taken, he delivers them from Jayl without the
Leave or Command os the Bishop and Inquisitor‚ or one of them ς οι· if he
doth direffly or indirectly hinder their Process‚ Judgrnent, or Sentence, or
do other Things like them. As appears from the Chapter before mentioned,

Ut Inquisitionis. ᾗ. prohibemus. All these are ipfh jure, excommunicated‚ as Fa-
vourers of Hereticks; and ifthey obstinately remain under this Excommuni-
cation for the Space of a Year, are to be punissied as Hereticks. The Coun-
cil of Tholoase hath appointed other Punishments for them. Chap. 3, 4. We
like-itast> ordain, thal whofhever shall knowingly permit any Heretick to dwell in his Ja-
risa'il'i'ion, either for Money, or any other Cause whatfhever, and shall confeſs, or he
convilied of this, he shall lOJe his Estate for ever, and his Body shall be in the Power
os his Lam, to clo wilh it as he ought to do. And if he he not convii‘ied of having
done this knowingly, ancl his Negligence be not proved to be scandalous‚ and yet He..
reticks are frequently found in his Coantry 3 or if he he defanzea' upon this Account, let
him stiffer the legal Punishments. See also the Bull of Paul IV. beginning, Cum
ex Apostolatus officio. Bzovius also relates‚ in his Account of the Year 1215..
ᾗ, 10. that by the Command of the Apostolical Legate the Walls ofNarbonne
were thrown down ·‚ and also of‘Tholoafi’, the greatest Part ofthem‚ because they
had been the Receptacles of Hereticks. The sarne Council of Tholouſse deter-
mines what shall be the Punishment of inferior Magistrates‚ in their several
Distrffls, if they are found negligent in apprehending Hereticks. Cap. 6.
As to the Balliveof any Place as to which there is any Presumption‚ who is always
Refident, unless he he found very diligent and careful against Hereticks‚ let him for-
feit all his Effebls, and never more be suffered to be a Ballive there, or any
where ele.

Privatse Persons are said to be Favourers of Hereticks, when out of their
own Rashness they free from Prison Hereticks‚ or Persons apprehended for
Heresy‚ or give any Affistance, Council or Favour towards their Delive-
rance, or so accompany thern, when freed, as not to seize them3 or refist
those who would apprehend thern, or presume direffly or indireffly to hindei·
Prooess, Judgment, or Sentence, in a Cause of Faith, or give Council, As-
fistance or F avour to such Hindrance. Private Persons indeed are not said to
be F avourers of Hereticks by mere Omiffion, viz. for not apprehending or
not taking them into Custody‚ as not being obliged to it. Nevertheless
they will be F avourers, if they shall omit to discover and apprehend thern,
when obliged to it by Office: Such, for Instance‚ are the Cross-bearers, who
in Spain are called Familiam ·, or if when called on by the Magistrate‚ to as-
sist in apprehending HeretickS, they refuse to do it without Reason, and
when they have nothing to prevent them.

Lastly, both Magistrates and private Persons may be said to be F avourers
of Hexeticks, by omitting to discover them, because all Persons are obliged
under Pain of Excommunication‚ to discover all Hereticks, even concealed

ones, to the Bissiops and Inquisitors, and, if it be neceffary, to accuse thegi.
