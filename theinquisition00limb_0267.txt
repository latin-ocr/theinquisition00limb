“ to be good, and that they who observed the said Order and Life might be
“ saved by observing ir, if they did not commit other Sins contrary to the
“ Commands of God. Being asked, if he believed that the Pope and Pre-
“ lates of the Roman Church, and the Religious and Inquifitors, did Evss, and
“ sinned in persecuting that Order‚ and those who observed and adhered to

“ the said Order3 he, after many WordS‚ answered finally, that he believed

‘⁶ they did Evil and smned in this, that they persecuted thatGood. Being
‘⁶ asked, if the Sentence of Excommunication pronounced by the Church of

“ Rome, or its Authority‚ against those who observed the said Order, did
“ bind them 3 he answered, that it did not, saying, that he had heard it said, ’
“ that the Sentence ofExcommunication unlawfully or unjustly pronounced by
“ any one, did not excommunicate another, but condemned the Person him-
“ self, and he brought and applied to that Purpose some Authorities from St.

“ Paul and the Gospel, and concluded, that he did not think himself to be ex-
“ communicated for holding the said Order, notwithstanding any Sentence,

‘⁶ altho’ he had heard it said oftentimes, and by many, that Gerard Sagarelli‚
“ who was the first Inventor of the said Order oprostles, and Dulcinus, who
‘² held the said Order, and many others of the said Order, were condemned by
“ the Inquifitors and Prelates of the Roman Church, and left to the secular
‘⁶ Arm and burnt. Item, Being question’d‚ if he believed those to be saved
“ who suffered Death for the said condemned Order, he would not at first an-

“ swer direffly that he believed them either to be saved or damned. But aste-r

“ many Days, being asked and re-examined upon this, he answered, that he

“ did believe that the said Gerard was unjustly condemned, saying, that one
“ Christian, especially if he be a learned Clerk, and underltands the Scripture,
“ ought not to deliver another Christian to Death. Item, He expounded ma-
“ ny Things out of the holy Scripture before the Inquifitor‚ according to his
‘⁶ own Understanding, to reproach the State of the Church, in which were
“ contained many erroneous Things 3 and amongst other Things, he said and
“ expounded, that when Poverty was changed from the Church by St. silvester,
‘⁶ then Sanffity of Life was taken from the Church, and the Devil enter'd into
‘⁶ the Companions of St. Silvester into this World. Item, That there was a
‘⁶ double Poverty, the one perfect, which the Apostles held, and all those who
‘⁶ follow and imitate them, hereby meaning himself, and those like him, viz.
“ to have nothing of one's own, or, in common. Item, There is an im-

“ Houses to abide in, and all Neceffaries to eat and drink in common. Item,
“ He said that there is a double Church, viz. the Spiritual and the Carnal ;
“ that the Spiritual Church is in those Men who live in perse& Poverty, and
“ in Humility, and spiritual Obedience to God, such as they are who imitate
“ the Life of the Apostles and Christ: That the carnal Church is of those
“ who live carnally, and in the Delights of the F lesh, and in Riches and in
“ Honours, and in Pomp and Glory, such as are the Bissiops and Prelateslof
