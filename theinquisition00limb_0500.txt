70 The HtsToRY of the INQmsrTioN.

that are divided into Tomes, which doth not professedly contain Heresy, is
not accounted to read a Book prohibited by the Bull Crsna, even tho’ the other
Tomes* should be heretical. But if a Tome contains Heresy, or treats of
Religion, and it: be divided into several Books‚ he who reads one of the
Books of such a Tozne, is said to read a Book prohibited by this Bull, even
though the particular Book doth notcontain Heresy, nor treat of Religion,
and is bound up separately from the others. Yea‚ 'tis enough to say that a
Person hath read a prohibited Book, if he onlyjust runs it over with his Eyes,
adverting to the Things written in it, though he doth not mention one Word
of it with his Mouth. And yet, which is strange, they add, that he who by
Memory recitesa prohibited Book, though hc doth it with an evil Inten- ,
tion, is not accounted so to read it, as to incur the Censure pronounced against
such who do·, so observant are they of the Letter of the Law ·, though at
the same time he incurs the Censure of the Bull, who reads a Book prohibi-
ted by it, though hc doth not do it with an ill Design, but out of pure Cu-
22. riosity, or to confute the Errors of Hereticks. But to a Man'sincurring the
23· Penalty of Excommunication‚ 'tis necessary that he should knowingly read it.
So that Ignorance excuses, but not when ’tis gross and affeffiied, viz. when a
Person pretends not to know that the Author of a Book was an Heretick‚
although he knew the Book treated of Religion, or that the Book treated of
28. Religion, although he knew the Author to be an Heretick. He who keeps
the aforesaid Books either in his own, or another's House‚ whether he under-
stands the Book or not, whether it be the whole or a part, even so much as a
33- fingle Leas, whether he keeps it to read, or only for Curiofity and Orna-
34· ment’s sake, or to exchange sor other Books, or towrap up what he sells with
the Leaves osit, incuss the Excomrnunication os the Bull. Likewise he who
causes it to be printed, defends it, praises it, says 'tis not fit to be burnt or
prohibited, or hinders its coming to the Inquifitors Hands.
35. These are all suspected concerning the Faith, and may be punished by the
30· Inquisitors as sus‘pthed. But if any one dotl: not deliver an heretica} Book
to the lnquisltors, but burns it by his own Authority, he is not suspected of⁴
Heresy, though he falls into Excomrnunication 3 because Julius III. by a Con-
Carena, stitution, beginning, Cum meditatio cordis, commands, that such Books shall
F· ²-- 1*·10·be really and effectually delivered up to the Inquifitors. When any one de-
⁵³' 4} livers up a Book to the Inquifitors, he must be interrogated by them whence
³9- he had it. He who keeps an heretical Book, which hath not the Author's
Name, is himself reputed the Author, unless he discovers his Name, and
41· whence he had the Book. If any bring the Bocks of Hereticks, prohibited
either sor Heresy, or false and suspefited Doctrine, to any Country of the
Faithsul, they are Favourers of Hereticks, incur Excommunication, have all
their Goods confiscated, and if they are mean Persons, are whipped3 but ifthey
are ofthe better Sort, they are banished at the Pleasure of the Inquifitors.
But these are not the only Punishments used. Tyranny prepares the VVay
42· for greater Cruelty. If there arises a vehement Presumption os Heresy, up-
on account of any one’s reading, retaining, defending, or printing the Books
