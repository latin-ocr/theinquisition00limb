Sousa,l.1. E who celebrates Mass, not being in Presbyters Orders, is subjeft to

⁹·32·⁷²·7· the Judgrnent of the Inquisitors, and opposes in Fa& the Catholick
Verity, according to the Constitution ofGregory XIII. beginning, Officii nostri.
The Evil os this Crime, according to Soztsa, reaches to Idolatry, because
those who thus celebrate, make the Faithful of Christ to adore Bread and
Wine, as though it were the true Body and Blood of our Lord.

In like manner he who is no Priest, and yet hears Confeffions, and gives
Absolufflon, is said to abuse the Sacrament, and greatly to injure his Neigh-
bour.

Carena, Such are vehemently suspeeted of Her-esy, because they think, at least as
1142-- t· 1¹·to the very Faet, that other Persons befides Priests may be the Ministers
9· Ι· of those Sacraments,
Such Criminals are to abjure as vehemently suspeffited, and are then delivered
over to the secular Arm to be punished with Death 3 but are first degraded
(916. 7230. from their Orders if they are in any. Thus An. 1636. and the following, two
of these Criminals were delivered over to the iecular Court at Naples, and by
Order of the holy Council first hanged, and then burnt.
q, 73 Urban VIII. commanded by a Letter ofCardinal Mellimfs, to the Inquifi-
’ tor General ol Portztgczl, March 5. 1622. that Criminals confeffing, or con-
vieted of this Crime, should be absolutely delivered over to the secular Arm,
and punished with Death. But in as much as before these Letters they were
not punished with Death in Spain, according to the Constitutione οιι Gregory
and Clement, so Soztscz affirms, that he never saw this Punisnment inflieled in
seusa, ,Η the Kingdoms of Spain, after the said Letters of Cardinal Mellinus. But this
“³32·7¹¹¹3'Was the Method of Punishment there generally made use os, viz. that if the
prctended Priest was a Layman, or vile Person, he was beat, and sent to

the Gallies, and enjoined some spiritual Pen ances. Or if he was a Person os ³

Credit, or a Religious, he was ient to the Gallies. If of such Quality as
that he could not 'be sent to the Gallies, he was banished3 and, if in any

Order, suspended from it the whole Time of his Baniffirnerit. If the Of-. ἵ

fence was attended with any aggravating Circumstances, they add other
Punilhments according to their Quality.

We have an Instance to this Pur-pose in the Book of Sentences of the Tho, ’
leuse Inquisition, ι[9]. 122. A certain Countryman called Relland, believed he 5

had a Power fron] the Lord to celebrate Mass, and to consecrate the true
Body of Ciu-ist from common Bread, and the true Blood from Wine mixed
with Oyl and salt, in a wooden Bowl that had a Foot to it, which he used
instead ol a Chaliccss. And thus he every Day sacrificet} secretly in his own,
