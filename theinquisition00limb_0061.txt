cal Curse, the opposite Councils having damned one another, and all that dis-
sered from them. And·if Councils, as such, have any Authority to ananie*
matisc all who will not submit to them, this Authority equally belongs to eve-
ry Council3 and therefore 'twas but a natural Piece of Revenge, that as the
Council of Nice had sent all the Arians to the Devil, the Arians, in their turn,
Ihould take the Orthodox along with them for Company, and thus repay one
Anathema with another. ⁶

Constantius himself was warmly on the Ari‘an fide, and favoured the Bishops
of that Party only, and ejected Paul the Orthodox Bishop from the See of Con=

treated them with great Lenity‚ and in this Instance punished them much less
than their insolence and F ury deserved. Soon after this Athanafius and Paul'c. 15.*
were restored again to their respective Sees; and upon Athanastus’s entering
Alexandria great Disturbances arose, which were attended with the Destruction
of many persons, and Athanasius accused of beingrthe Author of all those Evils.
Soon alter Paul's return to Constantinople he was banished from thence again by
the Emperor’s Order, and Macedonius re-entered into Poss‘effion of that See,
