Here there is a double Method of excusmg such Persons proposed. Is'irfff, 11
it be proved that the deceased Person, when alive, was not suspected 01· ‹iesa-
med of Heresy, but lived in good Repute‚ and received the Sacraments ot
the Church astera Christian Manner, at proper Times, and performed othes
Things which are usually done by true and Catholick Christians. Secondlv, lt‘
it can be shewn that he was not ofa found Minci, when he desired the Conso-
lation of Hereticks‚ which must be done one of these two ways: Either by
fhewing, that he was at a certain Time mad, and that 'tis to be presumed
that he committed the Crime whilst the Madness lasted, and during the Time
of such Madness 3 and in this Case the Fiscal or Judge, if he proceeds ex of-
ficio, must prove, that the Offence was committed when the Person was him-
self: Or by shewing, that by the Violence of his Distemper he was disturbed·
in Mind, and deprived of his Reason 3 for sometimes Persons are delirious in
a Distemper‚ especially in old Age, who in Health were in full Poffeffion of·-
their Senses and Reason. These· Proofs must not be made by their wives,
Children, or other Relations, but by Witneffes above all Exception, and in
the last Case skilful Phyficians are principally to be regarded, If the Chil-
dren fail in this Proof, their Excuse is not to be admitted,

Farther, fince a Criminal at the Article of Death ought to be sacra-Erre&
mentally absolved, if he confeffes, and is ready to obey the Commands ofP· 2·
the Church, according to the first Council of Grange, cap. 2. As to Heretirls‘·''⁷²' ²5¹
who lie at the Point of Death, is they destre to be Catholicks, let the Presbyter-s, gf
there be 7,- Bishop to doit, fign them with the Chrifin and Benedinion ; hence it of-
tentimes happens, that Persons dying have confeffed Heresy to a Priest, and
received their Absolution from him. And as no Aetion-can be carried on
against the Dead‚ unless it be presumed that they died-impenitent, there arose
formerly a Question in the Council of Tarragona‚ whether the Priest, who as-
serts that he absolved any one from Heresy, ought to be credited ? This Qe*
stion was at that Time of great importatum, because if the Priest affirming
this Matter was to be believed, the Inquifitors could not proceed- against such
a one after his Death. The Matter was thus decided in the Council of Tan-raa
gona. It is αζο inquired: that if any one should confess to his Priest Heresv, or
favour-ing ef Heresy, before she Inquisition began against him, and should be nster-
wards called on by the annistlors'? In such que his Conriffor must be believed ·, ami
if he be found 50 have rightly confcffi’d by the Confeffion qt* the Pries'i, ezftlao’ the Prnst
,bath done ill in not finding him to the Bishop, yet ‘the Petson conjeffing may avoid tem*
paral Pznn'fhmencbyfitch Confiffion, unless it be dzscovered that his Repentcznre τετυ
fabia or theat he relalnf‘ed after his Repentance, or was pubiickly dqfamsd.
