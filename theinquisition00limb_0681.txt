„Yon must abstainfrom and forbear such pecuniary Penances and Εκαέῖἑοπς, becaaft
of the Honour of your Order. If they have offended in the second Manner5
they are not according to the Rigour of the Law, to be received and absol-

Estates. C. Porro, and C. Parochianos‚ de sent. excom. You mast admomfh ami
persuade them, that they give due Satisfaezion to those they have injured. And, cause
them to be stridly avoided as excommunicated Perseus, till they have made proper
Satisfablion to the Persbns injured. If they can’t immediately give Satisfaction
for the Damage they have done, either thro’ Poverty or other Causes, they
arcto be absolved, upon giving, proper Secursty, viz. by laying something
down as a Pledge, or giving SuretIes to make Satisfaffion when they are
able, or when they shall come to a larger Estate. ’Tis also now a Custom ob·
served by all the InquisitorS, tho' it be provided for by no Law, gently to
strike with a Rod such as return when they absolve them.

Such Persons also are excluded from all publick Offices as infamous. These 3.·p.n. 3³1-
publick Offices are, Offices of all sortS, and of every Name‚ according to themn- 82
various Rites and Customs of different Provinces, The Council of Tholeuft:
reckons even the Office of a Phyfician amongst them. Cap. 14. We ordain
alsb, that whosoever shall be defamedfor Heressy, or marked as suspee'led, Jhall no

longer be allowed the Profeffion of a Physician.
Farther also, Penitents, and those remnciled, returni‘ng from Heresy to the

Church, and the Children and Grandchildren of condemned Persons are not
only excluded from bearing publick Offices, or hav-ing Benefices and Digni-
ties, but from ufing Silver, Gold, or precious Garments and ornaments,
according to the Council os Biterre‚ c. 28. Let them not hold Ballives or Admi-
nistrations, nor be in the Councils or Families of the Gran, nor be allowed to prab'lzfie
as a Phyfician or Notary‚ nor be admitted to other publick Offices, or legal Ae‘lions,
nor wear Gold·laced Cloaths‚ nor Silk, or the like Ornaments, or yellow Ribands,
nor Shoe-strings tagged ‹indstriped with Gold or Silver, nor carved or painted
Shoes ; and when z't appears proper, let them he turned out of the City where they
«luvelt, and remain for mee time in some other City or Pro-vince. 'Tis also
forbidden them to ride on Horses with Trappings, as Nobles do, which Pro-
hibition extends also to Mules. But in these Cases they allow a Dispensation
after some Time.

But the most usual Punifhment of all is, their wearin Crosses upon their
penitential Garments, which was not only formerly in se, but is now fre·
quently injoined Penitents in Spain and Portugal. And this is far from being
a small Punilhment. Because such Persons are exposed to the Scoffs and Insults
of all, which they are obliged to swallow‚tho' the most cruel in themselves, and
offered b the vilest of Mankind, for by these Croffes they are marked to all
Persons lgr Heres y, or as it is now in Spain and Portugal for Jue'aifin. And being fo 1, v„
thus marked, they are avoided by all, and are almost excluded from all human* ‘¹
society. We have an Instance of this in the Book ofSentences ofthe Tholoafe In-
quifition, in one Arnald Ysarm' os Villemaur‚ who had thrown off his Croffes, and
