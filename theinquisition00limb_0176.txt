The HrsToRY of the ΙΝρυιειτιοΝ,

condemn, whom they exposed under the infamous Name of Hereticks‚ and
render'd odious to the People, their Cruelty was not satisfied with one Degree
of Punilhrnent only·, they went from one to another, that sothe Doetrine
condemned by the Council might find none that should dare to defend it,
and so might at last be totally extirpated. From pecuniary Mulets, they
proceeded to the Forfeiture of Goods, Banissiment, and at length to Slaugh-
ter and Blood·‚ for such is the Nature of Cruelty, that it seldom confines
it self to the first Beginnings; but when it is once let loose, like an impe·
tuous Torrent, it speads it self every where, and from every Occafion grows
more outragious and furious. This will appear most plainly in the AccountI
arn now giving of the Methods for the Restraining and Punishment of He‘-
retickS.

For in the first Place, Laws were made against Hereticks, whereby they
were prohibited from having Churches, holding Affemblies‚ the enioying
any Ecclefiastical Preferments, the Consecration of Bishops, the ordination
of Priests, the making of Wills, the succeeding to Inheritances, the {haring in
any Charities, the Advancement to publick Offices, and ordaining severe Pu-
nilhments against those who did not observo these Preseriptions.

w, And first, it was determined who lhould be accounted Hereticks. They are
r . conflorehendecl under the Name os Hereticks‚ and are aciyudged lo the Punifhments pro-

nounced against such, who shall be discovered to differ, even in the least Point, from
the Judgment and Pranice of the Catholick Religion. By the same Law it is or-
dained, That no oue should dare, either to teuch or leurn those Things that shall have

ι iss been deereed to be profane.. By the Law following, their Churches are taken

from them, and they are prohibited to perform Holy Offiees, either in pri-
vate Houses or Churehes, under the Forfeiture of one hundred Pounds of Gold
upon all Contraveners. The following Law is yet more severe, which takes

· from them the Power of Giving, Buying, Selling, making Contraecs or Wills,

or inheriting their Parents Estates, unless they renounce their heretica] Pra-
vity. There are many Laws extant concerning the Banishment of Hereticks.

Impiety, have the Liberty of dwelling any where within the Dominions of the Roman

See also L. ¹Quicunque, where the forementioned Penalties are not only re-
peated, but other kinds of Punishinents ordained against them ·, which are all
extant in the Law of the Emperor Martum, who renews the Punishments or-
dained by the preceding Emperors against the Eutichians, and which is recorded
at the End of the Council of Chalcedon, and which will suffice instead of all
other Instances. By this Law the Emperor ordained, That they should not have
Po-wer of dispostng their Estates, and making a Will, nor of inheriting what others
should leave them by Will. Neither let them receive Advuntnge by any Deed of Gz'ft,
