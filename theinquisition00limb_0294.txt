The H1sToRY of the INotststa-tou.

in those Days of the inquisition, to exalt the F aith, and for the Confufion of He·
relies and Errors, there were so many evident Miracles wrought by pioussy
invocating the holy Virgin, that Doetor Francis Sam‘i'ius de la Fuente, one of
the said Fathers‚ who had undertaken the Care of writing those Tffiugs, was
quite tired out with writing them, through the Multitude ofthe Miracles.
For there were fixty Miracles counted up for the Confirmation of the Faith,
the Approbation ofthe Office ofthe holy Inquifflion, the Edification ofmany‚
and the Display of the Divine Power.

and Ifhbell, extended the supreme Power of the Inquifiti0n‚ which he had
granted to Thomas a Turrecremata, in the Kingdom of Castile, to Aragon, Ca-
talonia, Valencz'a, and Sicily. However, great Opposition was made to this
Tribunal in Aragon, many declaring that this new Form of the Inquisition
was contrary to the Prerogatives and Liberties of the Kingdom‚ and was in it
sels too severe and unrighteous 3 that the Depositions of the Witnesses were
not shewn to the Criminals·, and that Persons Estates were confiscated be-
cause of some heretical Mark3 which Things they affirmed were not only

contrary to the Usage of the Kingdom, but to every Rule of Justice. And

that they might more easily obtain the Abrogation of the Inquifition, they

sent a large Sum of Money to -the Courts of the Pope, and of the King.
However, they obtained nothing ·; so that at last the People broke out into

an open Tumult‚ which Raynald and Ozovz‘us principally attribute] to
the new Converts‚ who from the Jewish Superstition and Race were converted
to Christianity. Many of the principal Men joined themselves to thern, who
complained that new Laws were introduced contrary to the Liberties of Aragon.
During this Sedition Peter Arbuefius, the Inquisitor, was killed at Saragffl‚ as

' he was saying his Prayers before the High Altar. The Murder was imputed

ᾗ, 10, Π, to the Jews. [The Murderers, as Paramus relates‚ were not long after all

taken up by the Inquifitors, delivered over to the secular Arm, and suffered
most dreadful Punissiments] But all Attempts for the Liberty ofAragon were
in vain ·‚ and so far was this Tribunal of the Inquifition in Matters of Religion
from being aboliffied, that upon the Death of those who opposed it, it was
much more strongly confirmed than ever. For Ferdinand and Istzbel, to give
the >greater Authority to the Tribunal of the Inquifflion, gave the Royal 'Pa-
lace at Saragoffa to the Judges of the F aith, and by many Provifions confirmed
the Tribunal of the Faith.

They also endeavoured to propagate the Office of the ‘Inquisition in all

oviu , their Kingdoms. Pope Innocent VIII. pub-lished a Decree‚ An. 1491. against

those who should hinder any from appealing to the Apostolick See. When
that Constitution was published‚ it happen'd that the Bishops of Segovia and
Calahorre in Spain, their Parents, Kindred, and some other illustrious Ecclesia*
-stical Persons, powerful for their Riches and Interest, were accused of Heres}⁷
before the Inquisitor General of Aragmz, Valencia, and Catalom‘a. They ap·
pealed to Pope Innocent‚ that they might not be tried in the ordinary Court, but

that their Cause might be determined at the Court of Rome. F riar T homas Tur·-
