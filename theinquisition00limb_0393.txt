The H1sronx ofthe INQUtSITloN· 225

“ Rome, Sept. 10, 1518. But above all this is remarkable, that under Colour of
⁴‘ Faith and Religion, the Books of such Authors are prohibited and condemn⁴>
'⁴‘ ed with the same Severity, in which the Authority of Princes, and the Civil
“ Magistrate is defended against the unlawful Usurpations ostheEccleslasticks ·‚
“ and in which the Power of Councils and Bishops is maintained against the
“ unjust Encroachments of the Court of Rome.- And finally, all those which
“ plainly dcte& their Hypocrisy and Tyranny, by which, under the Disguise
“ of Religion, they impose on the People‚ or persecute thern. In a Word,
“ Religion was never before made subservient‚ by such an admirable Myste-

“ Books they had ever printed, or published, of whatsoever Author‚ Art,
“ or Language, and that with an Addition of great Moment, by which they
“ prohibited at once, all the Books that had been printed by any Printers,
“ who had ever printed a single Book of Hereticks. So that there scarce re-
“ mained any one Book to be read. And what added to this Severity of the
“ Inquifitors was, that the Penalty pronounced against those who read the
“ Books contained and prohibited in that Catalogue‚ was that of Excorn-
“ munication, [αἰαῖ sententiae, reserved to the Pope, the being deprived and
“ made incapable of Offices and Benefices, perpetual Insamy‚ and other ar-
“ bitrary Penalties. Pius IV. who succeeded Paul, revoked this severe Cen-
“ sure, and referred this Index, with the whole Affair‚ to the Council of
(G
nghiongst the F athers at Trent‚ there was a great Difference of Opinions Hsst· cmc.
‘² about the making this Index. For some thought that this of Paul IV. Trzd. P·
“ was sufficient, as being rnost perse& in it sels3 and that ifany one should al· 553·
“ low the Books prohibited in this Catalogue‚ he would declare that this
“ Proceeding at Rome was imprudent, which would be to take away all Au—
“ thority from the Index already published, and from the Decree now to be
“ made 3 because it was a common Maxim, That new Laws leffen their own
“ Value, more than they do that of the old ones. Lewis Beccatellus, Arch-
“ bishop of Ragufi, said there was no Need of Books, because there was
“ more than enough of them fince the Invention of Printing 3 and that it was
“‘ rnuch better that many Books should be prohibited without Cause, than
“ that one which deserved Prohibition should be allowed. Others thought
“ ‘that the Council should take this Affair of the Books into their Confiderati-
·“ on, as if there had not been any Prohibition at all before ·, because that that
“ which was made by the Inquifitors at Rome, was for that Name hateful to
“ the Ultramontanes, and was so very severe, that no Body could observe it.
“ That there was no juster Reason in the World for repealing a Law, than
⁴⁶ that it cannot be observed, or at least, not without great Difficulty ·‚ espe-
⁴‘ cially if the Punishrnent annexed to the Breakers of it was too severe.”
At Length, the Fathers‚ after several Debates‚ not being able to agree,
thought fit to refer the whole Affair to the Pope. Upon this, Pope Pius
