On these Accounts it is highly incumbent on all Nations‚ who enioy the Bles:
fings of a limited Government, who would preserve their Constitution‚ and
transmit it safe to Posterity‚ to bejealous of every Claim of spiritual power,
and not to enlarge the Authority and JurisdiCtion of spiritual Men, beyond
the Bounds of Reason and Revelation. Let them have the sreest Indulgence to
do good, and spread the Knowledge and Prac‘stice oftrue Religion, and pro·
mote Peace and Good-will amongst Mankind. Let them be applauded and
encouraged, and even rewarded, when they are Patterns of Virtu-e, and Ex·
amples of real Piety to their Flocks. Such Powers as these God and Man
would readily allow them, and as to any other I apprehend they have little right
to them, and am sure they have seldom made a wise or rational Use ofvthem.
On the contrary, numberless have been the Confufions and Mischiefs introdu-
ced into the World, and occasioned by the Usurpers of spiritual Authority.
In the Christ=an Church they have ever used it-with lnsolence, and generally ·
abused it to Oppreffion and the worst of Cruelties. And though the History
of such T1·.2nla<5tions can never be a very pleafing and grateful Tassz, yetI
think, on many Accounts it may be useful and instrustive ·‚ especially as it may
tend to give Men an Abhorrence of all the Methods oi Persecution, and put
them upon their Guard against all those ungodly Pretenfions, by which Herse·
cution hath been introduced and supported.

But how much soever the persecuting Spirit hath prevailed amongst those who
have called themselves Christians‚ yet certainly 'tis a great mistake to confine it
wholly to thern. We have instances of Perseus, who-were left to the Lightof
Nature and Reason, and never suspected of being perverted by Revela-ion,
murthering and destroying each other ori the-Account of·Religion ;-and of some
judicially condemned to Death for differing from the Orthodox‚ i. e. the esta.-
blished Idolatrv oftheir Country. And Idoubt not, but that if we had as full
ind particular an Account ofthe Transaffionsof the different-religious Sests
and Parties amongst the Heathens, as we have of those amongst Christians‚ we
should find a great many more Instances of this kind, than 'tis easy orpoffible
now to produce. However‚' there are some very remarkable ones which vI.
shall not wholly omit. ”
