Κ[7,6, The H1s1-0mr ofthe INQUISITION.

cautious'Pmceeding in the Affair of the Inquzfifion, by Authority of this present
Constitution, we permit, ‘Thac the Bishop or Inquisitors may enjoin Secrecy 'to those,
whom they emrztst with the Knowledge of such Process 3 ancl if they think fit, publish
againstthemtheSentence ofExconznzunz'catiom which they, ipso facto, incur, by dis.
coverz'ng the Serra, if they shall reveal the Secrets of the Camil, or Proceffes, com-
mitted to them in Secrecy, by the Bzfhop ον Inqfflsttors, to (my Person, without their

carena, Leave. The Counsellors also generally swear that they will keep Secrecy, and

P· ¹· t· 8·not reveal the Affairs treated ofin the Congregation, under the Penalty of

²⁴⁷· ⁶5· Excommunication‚ to be igffifczfio incurred, from which they cannot be ab-
solved, but by the Cardinals‚ supreme Inquisitors. They likewise swear un-
der the same Penalty‚ that they will not speak of, or debate‚ either by Word
or Vv‘riting, or any other way, of those Things which concern the Causes
of the holy Office, unless it be with the Counsellors, and other Officials
of the said Office. And although they should not expresly sware3 yet there
are many Laws that oblige them to keep it, enjoining them not to dis—
cover the Causes os Faith, because of the great Danger that may arise from
it. And if they should make such Discovery, though not sworn to Secrecy,
they may be punished by the Inquifitors without the usual Way of Proceeding.
But if they have malicioussy done it, and especially to those who may obstrust
the Affair of the Ruth, or otherwise hinder the Cause, they may be puniffi-
ed as Obstructors of the holy Office, more or less, according to the Na-
ture of the Offence, by which the Measure of the Punishment is to be
revulated.

‘I'fssifhops or Inquifitors discover the Secrets of the holy Office, they would
indeed incur no Censure, but be guilty ofmortal Sin'3 unless they also should have
taken an Oath of Secrecy in the Congregation of their Counsellors, according
as the Congregation of the Cardinal, supreme Inquifitors‚ hath‘ decreed they
ought to do. For they also take themselves the like Oath of Secrecy.

,τῃ Zanch. Camillus Campegius contends‚ “ That the whole entire Process, with the
cap, 15· “ Names and Circumstances‚ is not to be published to the Counsellors 3 because
‘⁶ they have their Factions and Paffions‚ fince they are Fellow Citizens·‚ or
‘⁶ otherwise allied to the Criminals, their Friends and Relations‚ whereby
‘⁶ the Safety ofthe Witneffes will not be sufficiently provided for, according
‘⁶ to the Decree of the Canon. Nor doth it fignify, though the Inquifitor or
“ Bishop should enjoin them to Secrecy under the Sentence of Excommuni-
“ cation, to be ipsofczblo incurred upon their disclofing the Secrets ε For they
“ would think this as a very great Injury done them. Befides, this would be
“ a Snare laid for their Souls ·, for they would soon fall under Excommunica-
“ tion, through the importunate Instances of inquifitive Persons. Nor will
“ this derogate any Thing from the Process of the Faith, or the Depofition
‘⁴ of the WVitneffes: Yea, rather the imminent Danger apprehended by the
“ Judges, is a suffi cient Reason for not making a Discovery to the Counsellors,
“ any more than to the Criminals. So that'tis safer to observe the ancient
“ Custom, and not to discover the Witneffes N ames to the Counsellors. The
