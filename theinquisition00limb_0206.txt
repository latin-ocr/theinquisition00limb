made in the City Zaterus. Cap. 103. gives an Account of various Punish·
ments infliffiied, by the Cruelty of which many were forced to Apostacy‚
though not one put to Death. Yea‚ there is an Account, ᾗ. 13. “ That
‘⁶ some, who begged rather to be put to Death‚ than compelled to Apo-
“ stacy, were answer’d: Caefar did not thirst after their Blood, but the Salva·
‘⁶ tion of their Souls. The like Requesl: made by others was received with
‘⁶ Laughter. Ho, Sirrah‚ Do you want the Honour of Martyrdom? Ye
‘⁶ Wretches‚ you are unworthy of having any Occaston wherein to glory.” From
these Examples 'tis clearer than Day, that some Persecutions, though not
reaching to Death, may be more cruel than Death it self. And though
poffibly some Person may pretend a Sort of Gentleness in all this, yet let
him remember what Bellarmiiie justly writes, De Laicis, l. 3. c. 21. That Au-
stin excepts the Punishment of Death ·, not that he thought they did not defi’rve
it, but because it became the Clemency of the Church3 and becauſse there were, as
yet, 720 imperial Laws .· For the law Qicunque, C. de Haeretici, was not made
till a little afi‘er Austin's Death, ordainiiig Heretickr to be put to Death. By
which he plainly infinuates‚ that he believed that if there had been any im·
perial Law, ordaining the Punishment of Death to Hereticks, Austin would
have approved of it·‚ for he immediately adds: Thai it appears that Austin
thought z't just to kill Heretick53 because he fhews, lhat if the Donatists were

pur to Death, they would be jzistly pzmifhed, l. 1. cont. Epist. Parmen. e. 7.
ν and elstrae-here.

If any one will compare these Things with the former Opinion of Aiifiin,
he rnayjustly cry out, Oh how much is Austin changed from himself, who,
mindful of his own former Error, from which he was not recover'd, but by
the great Patience of his Friends, was against using Methods of Cruelty,
even towards the Manicha’ans. But now he approves of all Punishments
against the Donatists, Death only excepted, that they may be compelled into
the Catholick Church, even against their Wills, under a Pretence that at
last they rnay voluntarily remain in her Comlnunion. Now he puts into the
Mouths ofPersons these forced studied Speeches and Pretences, by which they
are taught to palliare their Return into the Church, which was in reality
wholly owing to Violcnce and the Fear of Punishment, as though it had
been voluntary, and the very Means of their Salvation. But let us sup-
pose, that they believe themselves obliged by Virtue of a divine Command to
preach their Doctrine, lest they should disobey God ·‚ and that therefore they
ought to return into their own Country to propagate it: What would good
