The ΙΝΤΒοΒυοἸ-[οκῖ

by the Clergy of each Party. The Prince of Grange, and States ofHolland,
who were heartily inclined to the Reformation, were not for confining their
Protection to any particular Set of Principles or Opinions, but for granting
an universal indulgence in all Matters of Religion, aiming at Peace and mu-
tual forbearance, and to open the Church as wide as poffible for all Christians
of unblameable Lives; whereas the Clergy beingbiaffed by their Paffions
and Inclinations for those Musters, in whose Writings' they had been instrucled,
endeavoured with all their Might to establiss] and conciliate Authority to their
respetfftive Opinions·‚ aiming only at Decislons and Definitions, and ssiutting
up the Church by Limitations in many doubtful and disputable Articles; so
that the Disturbances which were raised, and the Severities which were used
upon the Account of Religion, proceeded from the Bigotry ofthe Clergy, con-
trary to the Deli re and Intention os the civil Magistrate.

Before the Ministers of the reformed Party were engaged in the Controversy
with Arminius, their Zeal was continually exerting it selfagainst the Anabaptists,

' ’Μ 7- whom they declared to be excommunicated and cut off from the Church, and en·

deavoured to convert byViolence and Force, prohibiting them from preaching
under Fines, and banishing them their Country, upon account os their Opinions.
And the better to colour these Proceedings, some of them wrote in deience of
Persecurion ·‚ or which is the same Thing, against the Toleration of any Reli-
gion or Opinions different from their own ·, and for the better Support of Or-
thodoxy, they would have had the Synods ordain, that all Church Officers
should renew their Subscriptions to the Conieffion and Catechism every Year,
that hereby they might the better know who had changed their SentimentS,
and differed from the received Faith. This Praffitice was perfeffly agreeable
to the &meva Discipline 3 Calvin himself, as hath been ffiewn, being in Judg-
ment for persecuting Hereticks ·‚ and Beza having wrote a Treatise, An. 1600.
to prove the Lawfulness of punishing them. This Book was transsated from
the Latin, into the Low Dutch Language by Bogerman‚ afterwards Prefident
of the Synod of Dori, and published with a Dedication, and Recommendation
os it to the Magistrates. The Consequence os this was, that very severe Pla-
carts were published against the Anabaptists in Fricssand and Groningen, where·
by they were forbidden to preach; and al] Persons prohibired from letting
their Houses and Grounds to them, under the Penalty oi a large Fine, or
Confinement to Bread and Water for fourteen Days. Is they offended the
third Time, they were to be banished the City‚ and the Jurisdiistion thereos.
Whosoever was discovered to rebaptize any Person should forfeit twenty Dol-
lars·, and upon a second Conviction be put to Bread and Water, and then be
banished. Unbaptised Children were made incapab‘le of inheriting3 and if
any married out of the reformed Church, he was declared incapable of inheri·
ting any Estate, and the Children made illegitimate.

But the Controversy that made the greatest Noise‚ and produced the most
remarkable Effec'ts, was that carried on between the Calvinists and Arminians.
Jacobus Arminius, one of the Proseffors of Divinity at Leyden, disputing in his

turn about the Doctrine oi Predestination, advanced several Things diffefring
