quisitors, after confidering the Acts, to consult about apprehending the Per-
son, without any Instance of the Fiscal‚ and to command what they resolve
on to be put in Execution. And this Decree for the Apprehension is also
usually inserted in the Process, with the Day, Month and Year. But if the
Party accused be some illustrious Person, or in any Post of great Authority‚
pegma, the Senate os the Spanish inquisition must be consulted before he is to be appre-
(0271-107·hended‚ to whom that their Deliberations may be right, they must send a
²⁷³.3{'‘²⁷t‘ Summary of the Proof3‚ and the Information of the Crimes. This is ‚ga--
ssfrfd‘ thered from the Madrid Instruction, An. 1561. cap. 5. If the Inquisstors agree
'q as to the Apprehenston, let them command what they have decreed to be executed.
But if it be a Matter of great Moment, by reason of the Qtality of the Persem, or
for other Causes, let them first consult the Senate before they put their Decree in Exe-
cution. But zf they don't agree z'n their Judgments, let the Matter be referred to the
Senate, that they may confider what is proper to be done. But this very great and
exquisite Caution must not be obser-ved, when there is any Fear of the Escape
ofthe Person accused‚ oris he is a manifest Heretick. For in such Case they
think it would be imprudent and dangerous to waic for the Answer of a Su·
erior.

P After 'tis determined that the Crimina] shall be sent to Jayl, the Inquisitor-
subscribes an Order sor his Apprehenfion, and gives it to the Executor, who
is to take up the Criminal. The Form os the Order is this: By Command of
the Reverend Father N. an Inquisttor of heretical Pravity‚ let N. be apprehendea’
and committed to the Prisons of the holy Office, and not be released but hy the express
Order of the said Lora⁷ Inquifitor. Isseveral Criminals are to be taken up at the
same time, a separate Order for each Person must be given to the Executor,
that if it should be necessary to acquaint any Person, who is not one of the
Ministers or Officials of the holy Office, with the apprehending os one or
another Criminal, he may know nothing of the taking up of the rest. This
Order must be inserted in the Criminals Process by the Notary‚ in the very*
Words in which ’tis given to the Executor. Ifthe Inquifitors have an armed«
Attendance of their own, they give this Order to their own Executor. If
they have not such an armed Attendance, but find it necessary to call in the
Help of the secular Judge, the Inquisitor must take Care, that such Orders
be given to a trusty Executor, and who knows how faithfully to keep the Se-
cret heis intrusted with, because, if the Person to be apprehended should re-

ceive any private Information, he would easily escape.

In a City, where any noble Persons, DoctorS, or Religious‚ or others of '11-
lussrious Birth or Dignity are to be sent to Jayl, the Commiffary of the In-
quifition‚ or some other Officer‚ usually goes to the Houses of such Persons,
and takes them in a Coach and carries them to Jayl. But if there is no Fear
of their Escape, they are commanded to come to the holy Office by a special
Messen er.

Whegn the Criminal is apprehended‚ he must be well guarded, and if there
be Need, put in Irons, and thus carried by the Executor to the Jayls of the
Inquifition‚ and delivered into the Hands of the Jayl-Keeper. The Keeper
