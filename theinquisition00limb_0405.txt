The Hiswomr ofthe INQtristTIoN.

jz,- Need of a greater Inquisition‚ and ofa summary Cognisance, before Cri-
minalg are apprehended. So that no one ls lightly to be shut up in close Pri-
son for small Offences, for Propositions that found ill, or that are scandalous,

Τ or blasphemous‚ or others which do not contain real Heresy3 but ᾗς to be
confined either in some Monastery, or in his own House or City.

, The Inquifitors may indeed proceed in the Crime of Heresy against any
i Person, especially if he be otherwise vile, upon a light and moderate Suspi-
cion, so far as to ask such suspected Person, what he thinks of the Faith. But

, in order to apprehend any one for Heresy, two credible Witneffes are re-
J quired‚ although they say that the Testimony ofa single one, if beyond all

Exception, is sufficient, who deposes what he saw or heard·‚ yea, if he be
not beyond all Exception, yet is otherwise fit, provided he agrees with the

’ Informer ·‚ for in this Case they say there are two Witnesses, and consequent-
2 ly more than half Proof, whichffis sufficient for any ones being apprehended.
ξ But that one Witness above all Exception, is enough in this Case, they

prove from the Madrid Instmffion, An. 1561. Cap. 4. which says, If the

ἵ Testimony be not sufficient for the apprehending. This Instruffion is in the fin-

gular Number, and therefore int1mates‚ that one lawful Witness against any

i one is sufficient for his being taken up 3 especially if the Person be scandalous,

and vile, and suspeffed ·‚ as are all the new Converts of the Mahometan Se&
’m the Kingdom of Valencia 3 and as Royas says, the Fremh and Germans of the

Lutheran. But if the Person accused be noble, and of good Reputation„

and Fame, he is not to be apprehended upon a fingle Testimony. How-
ever, this is left to the Pleasure of the Judge, after having considered the
Qiality of the Person and his Offence 3 not that the Inquisitors of the Faith
ssiould appear eager to take up Crimina133 for they are always to use great
Circumspection. This is especially neceffary in the receiving and exaniining
Witnesses. They must in the first Place admonish them, how horrible and
dreadful a Wickedness it is to give false VVitness in any Causes, and especi-
ally in the holy Office of the Inquisition, and that they should have God and
his awful and tremendous Judgment before their Eyes, that they may not,
for Prayer‚ or Price, or Entreaty, or any other wicked Affthion, defame an
innocent Person with so great a Crime. Then the Vv‘itneffes are to be inter-
rogated concerning the Place, and Time, what they saw or heard 3- whether
the Person asted, or pronounced heretical Words, once or oftner ·, with what
Obstinacy or Eagerness he affirmedthem 3 and what other Persons were pre-
sent3 and for what Causes, Reasons‚ and Occasions they were present3 and⁴
concerning all other Circumstances necessary. to discover the Truth or False-
hood. χ

These Things premised, the Witneffes received, and the Propofirions qua-
lified, the Promotor Fiscal demands before the Inquisitors, that the Criminils

be apprehended and imprisoned, that they1.may suffer the deserved Punilh-
ment.

When the Offence thus appears, and 'tis proper to apprehend [he C12111i.2.11,1”0n³
