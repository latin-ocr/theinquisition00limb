a Ship that was ready to sail from the Port ; and burn’d down the Offi-ce
of the Inquifition, with all the Papers in it; so that the Inquifition was in-
terrupted and suspended during the Space of ten whole Years. After this the
Emperor, by Decree of his Council, renewed it, An. 1543. and ordered it to
be restored to all its former Privileges‚ which were confirmed by Philip 11.
An, 1546. The Consequence of this was, that the Nobles, Barons‚ and most
illustrious Persons of the Kingdom, who before hated every Thing belong-
ing to the Inquifition, and the very Name of its Ministers‚ now defired to
become its Officials and F amiliars ; and by their own Liberality caused to be
built convenient Prisons for the Guilty, which could not be done before by
Reason of the small Revenues and Returns of the holy Office. When ever
there are any Ediets publish'd, or Acts of Faith celebrated, they affist at
them in great State, and accompany the Inquifitors in their Progress through
the Isle, entertain them generoussy, and secure them from every Insult·‚ so
that no Sedition of the People can poffibly overthrow it. For in the Year
1562. as the Inquifitor Horofius was publishing an Edi& ofthe Faith at Pa-
lerm0, and was hinder’d by the Tumult of the People, the Sedition was eafily
appeas³d by the Appearance of the Nobles and Barons, who were Familiars ;
‚so that the following Day the Edi& was publish’d with universal Applause,
and without the least Oppofition. And when afterwards there arose some
Differences between the Viceroy and secular Judges on one Hand, and the
Inquifitors on the other, about their Jurisdic‘tion, Philip ΙΙ. with the Advice
of two Counsellors of the Supreme General Council of the Inquifition, An.
1580. confirmed all the ssPrerogatives of the Inquifition ; and in the Year
following decreed, that the Counsellors of the holy Office, and the Familiars
thereof, should, in all Causes‚ Civil and Criminal, enjoy the Pte-eminences
and Court ofthe holy office, as Persons of the same Rank with the Penfio·
nary Officials. After this he commanded the Viceroys, by his Royal Letters,
September 18, 1587. that they should pay all that Honour and Observance to
it, which so holy a Service was worthy of. But in the Year 1592. Count
Alva, Viceroy of that Kingdom, declared by a publick Ediet, that the Pre-
rogatives of the Nobles, Familiars of the Court ofthe holy Office, were sus-
pended ; and from thence they have had no great Affection for the Inquisi-
tion, nor any longer discharge the Function of Familiars.

The same Princes brought the Inquifition into Majorca, M'inorca, and Sar-cap. 11 δε
