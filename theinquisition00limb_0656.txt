‘¹ Torture, either confess, or I will order you to the Torture, frightening

‘¹ him by this Means as much as he can, upon hearing of which he makes
“ his Confestim, in such a Cafe the Confeffion is not said to be made thro*
“ Fear of Torments, because the Terror it self is but ssight. »
But if he perfists in his Confeffion, owns his Fault‚ and asks Pardon of
the Church, he is condemned as guilty of Heresy by his own Confeffion, but
as penitent. But if he obstinately perfists in Heresy, he is condemned, and
delivered over to the secular Arm to be punished with Death. If the accu-
sed Person is found to have fallen into Heresy‚ or there is otherwise Evidence·
proved against him, upon account of which he is obliged to abjure, as light-
ly or vehemently suspected of Heresy, he must not be tortured on this Ac-
count3 but if belides this he denies some Things not sufficiently proved, and
there be Proofs sufficient to put him to-the Qestion, and he accordingly is
tortured, but confeffes nothing, he is not to be absolved, but is to be pro·
ceeded against according* to the Things proved, and must be commanded to=
abjure either as suspeeted, or found guilty, as the Merits of the Process re-
quire. Or if he confeffes any Thing by Torture, he must be forced also-

ω abjure it.>

Day he will make a Sermon concerning the Faith‚ commanding all to. be*
present at it. When the Day comes, the Person to abjure is brought to the·
Church, in which the Council hath determined that he shall make his Abju-
ration.. There he is placed upon a Scaffold‚ erested near the Altar, in the
Midst of the People, and is not allowed to fit, but stands on it that all may
{see him, bare-headed‚ and with the Keepers standing round him. The Ser·
mon being made on the Mass, to the People and Clergy there. present, the In-
quifitor says publickly, that the Person there placed on the Scaffold is suspect-⁴»
ed', from such and such Appearances and Affions, of the Heresy thathath been.
refuted in the publick Sermon, and that therefore 'tis fit that he ssrould purge
himself from it, by abjuring it as one ssightly suspected. Having said this,
a Book of the Gospels is placed before him, on which laying his Hands he
abjures- his Herefy0· ln this Oath he not only swears that he: holds that.
