especially when other Prooss are wanting. Nothing legally sets aside any one Sym&-

If the Criminal consefl‘es his Offence, the Cause is finiffied. If he confeffes
it, but with the Addition os some Circumstance, that either takes away, or
leffens the Crime‚ the Procurator of the Exchequer receives the Conseffion of
the Offence, and puts it upon him to prove the Circumstance added. Now
there are various Circumstances to be urged in Abatement, which the Advo-
