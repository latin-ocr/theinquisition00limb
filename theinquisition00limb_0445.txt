Of the Civil sztfhments qs ΗΕΒ ETICKS.

Olitical Punishments appointed by the Canon and Civil Laws against He-
P reticks, are various.

The first is what is commonly called, the Confiscation of their Goods.
Cap. Vergentis in Senium. de haeret. We ordain that the Goods ofHereticks be con-
fistated in all Countrz‘esfizbjeft to our temporal Jurisdia‘lz'on, andin other Places alst) by
the Powers and secular Princes of them 3 and zf they should prove negligent in this Af-
fair, we will and command that they be compelled to it, by an Eccleficzstical Censttre,
without Benefit of Appeal.

[“ This Confiscation of Effeeffi, Lewis a Paramo derives from the Example L. 1. t. 2-
‘⁶ of God‚ who, not contented with the Sentence of Death pronounced against. ⁶· 7.p.45·
“ our first Parents‚ drove Man from the Place of his Delighrs, stript of all
“ his Goods, wounded in Naturals‚ and spoil’d of those Gifts that had been
“ freely granted him, his original Integrity especially being irreparably lost,
“ and adjudged him tohard and continual LabourS, and out of his Hatred to
“ so great a Wickedness, commanded the very Earth to bring forth Briars
“ and Thorns. This Example‚ he saith, the most holy Tribunal of the In-
“ quifition follows, confiscating by ajust Proscription the Goods ofHereticks,
‘² and depriving them ofall their Effefts and Fortunes. ·Neither ought this
“ Instance to be accounted Foreign from the Case. For altho' the Confisca-
“ tion of Effects doth not regularly take place as to all other Crimes‚ tho?
“ very heinous, nevertheless God‚ the first of the lnquifitors‚ that in this de-
“ testable Crime of Heresy he might give an Example to other delegatetl ln-
“ quiffiors, deprived our Parents of all their Effects, of the Poffeffion oftheIr
“ earthly paradise, the Use ofallthe Fruits of it, and their Dominion over
“ all the Creatures 3 for they did not only after this not obey our first Pa>-
“ rents, but became Enemies to them. He also deprived their Children and
“ Succeffors oft'nese Goods, &a and this irrevocably. Nor can any one ever
“ more come to such a Place.’'] Moreover, the Goods of Hereticks are de-
clared ipſs> jure, confiscate, in the Chap. Cum secundum leges. de haeret. l. ,6.
We decree by the Advice of our Brethren‚ that the Goods of Hereticks, who offend more
grievoufly‚ horribly and detestably than the before mentioned, be ipso jure, con·

T'nis Law is of great Use in the Tribunal‘of the Inquifitima, and extream-
ly hard and severe upon the Criminals‚ their Relations and Heirs. For hence §tum-ic„
itis, that because the Goods of Hereticks are ipso jure confiscate, they be- [ἐκ ,1-
come forfeited from the very Day of their Crime, so that all Donaticns* by 9· ²¹²3&
Hereticks, altho' secretly made, are null and void. Even Portions given tO
Daughters, to support the Burthens of Matrimony‚ tho² it be the Duty

ol a Father to portion them out, or given to such as have taken on themhtllie
