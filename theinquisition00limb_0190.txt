22 The HISTORY oj'theINQU1str10N;

strians are not to be excus'd in their barbarous Treatment of the Ortho-
dox ·‚ yet we read that sometimes it was greatly abated. Socrates in his Ec-
clefiastical History, l. 4. c. 32. relates of Valens the Emperor, That he vio-
lently oppos'd those who profeffed the Dofflrine of Consuhstantiat'ity, threatning
them every Day with severer Panishments 3 till Themistius the Philoshpher partly
mitigated his Rage, hy aa Oratim, called πεσσεωνητικος, in which he adnzonzfhes the
Emi-ersi, that he should not so greatly wonder that there was fitch a Diveifity -of
Opinions among& Christi-‘ans 3 for that it was bnt fhzall if compared with the Num-
laer of the different Opinions amongst the Greeks, which were more than three hun—
dred. This Variety of Opinions nittst neceffarily cause Divisions 3 lntt that God was
rleased with this Diverfity of Sentiments, that all might learn the nzore to reverence
*his Majcsty from the Difficulty oficnderslanding him. When the Philosopher had re-
presented these and other Things of like Mna-e to him, the Emperor gr ew afterwards
more mild, though he did not entirely lay afide his Fnry, panishing the Priests with
Banistsment instead of Death. But asto-warch, as the same Socrates relates,
c. 3 5. being pressecl with the Gothick VVar, he left off banishing the Homon-
stans. Farther, there were some amongst them who abstained from all Vio-
lence in Matters ofReligion, and were willing to allow the free Exercise of it
to those who differed from them. Grotius gives them this Testimony : Nor
proleg. adis this a little to their Praise, that the Vandals, about the ‘Times of Hunnerick
Procop. and Gundemond, and the Goths‚ always abstained from offering Violence to the
ooth. &³ Consciences of those subjea' to them, and permitted the Followers of the Nicene Faith
g-a'nldahc, to believe and teach, and perform divine Worship as they pleased. T he Ambaffa-
ὁ ’ dors of the Goths said to Belffarius, that they never forced any one with Threat-
nings to change his Profeffon 3 nor hinder’d the Goths theinftlves from believing the
Nicene Faith 3 adding, that the Goths did not shew less Reverence towards the
sacred Places than the Romans themselves. And a little after, p. 32. Theude-
:ricl<, King of the Ostrogoths and Italy, is highly extolled by Eunodius, the Catholick
Bishop of Ticinum, for his Piety and Worfhip of the true God. Such was his Re-
gard even to the Religion he did not profess, that he always made the best Men Bi-
fhops. Concerning which, his Nephew Athalarick thus writes: “ ’Twas but
‘⁶ just to obey the Will of so good a Prince, who in a Religion he did not be-
“ lieve, a&ed with so wife Deliberation, as to choose such a Bishop, as made
“ it appear that this was his governing Defire‚ to see the Religion of all Chur-
⁶< ches flourish under good Priests.'' Hence it came to paſs, that he called a Synod
to put an End to a Schism that had ar0se, as Paulus Warnefredi, and Zonaras de-
clares He annztlled all Simoniacal ordinatam, and defired the Catholick Bishops
to pray in his Behalf for the divine Affistance 3 as may besee-n in Calliodorus: So
that I do not wonder that Silverius, Catholick Bishop of Rome, was suspefft'ed by
the Greeks, of favonring the Erit-pire of the Goths rather than the Greeks.
[Procopius fztrniffses ns with this noble Instance of the Equity of the Goths in Re-

tO'zOtt. γ
ᾧΙη like Manner the Orthodox Emperor-s did not always* make Use of that
Severity which their Laws threaten’d against Hereticks‚ it being sometimes
their Intention only to terrify with the Fear of Punishments‚ and not to infligit
