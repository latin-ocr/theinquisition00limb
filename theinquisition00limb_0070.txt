as she was returning home from a Visit, one Peter a Clergyman, with some
other Murtherers, seized on her, dragged her out of her Chariot, carried her
to one of the Churches, stripped her naked‚ scraped her to Death with Shells,
then tore her in pieces, and burnt her Body to Ashes.

Innocent als0, Bishop of Rome, grievoussy persecuted the Novatians, and took
from them! many Churches ·, and, as Socrates observes, was the first Bilhop of
that See who disturbed them. Celestz'ne also, one of his Succeffors‚ imitated
this Iniustice, and took from the Novatians the Remainder of their Churches,
and forced them to hold their Affemblies in private 3 For the Bzfhops of Rome,
as wellas those of Alexandria, had usurped a tyrannical Power, which,¹ as Priests,
they had no right to ·, and would not suffer those who agreed with them in the
Faith, as the Novatians did, to hold publick Affemblies, but drove them out
of their Oratories, and plundered thern of all their Substance.

Nestorius, Bishop of Constantinople‚ immediately upon his Advancemenr,
shewed himself a violent Persecutor; for as soon as ever he was ordained, he
addressed himself to the Emperor before the whole Congregation, and said,
Purge me, O Emperor, the Earth from Hereticks, 'and I will give thee in recompence
the Kingdom of Heaven. Conquer with me the Hereticks, and I with thee will fitbdue
the Perfians. And agreeable to his bloody Wishes, the fifth Day after-his
Consecration, he endeavoured to demolish the Church of the Arians, in· which
they were privately affembled for Prayer. The Arians in their Rage, seeing„
the Destruc‘tion of it determined‚ set Fire to it themselves, and occasioned
the Burning down the neighbouring Houses ; and for this Reason not only the
Hereticks, but those of his own Persuafion‚ distinguished him by· the Name of
Incendiary. But he did not rest here, but tried all Tricks and Methods to de·
stroy Hereticks; and by these Means endangered the Subverfion of Constanti-
nople it sels. He persecuted the Novahans, through hatred of Paul their Bi-
ssaop for his eminent Piety. He grievoussy oppreffed those who were not Or—
thodox as to the Day of keeping Easter, in Asta, Lydia, and Caria, and occa-
fioned the Murthers of great Numbers on this Account‚ at Miletus and
Sardis.

F ew indeed of the Bishops were free from this wicked Spirit. Socrates, how-
ever, tells us, that Atticus Bishop of Constantinople was a Person of great Piety
and Prudence, and that he did not offer Violence to any of the HeretickS, but
that after he had once attempted to terrify them, he behaved more mildly and
gently to them afterwards, Proclus also, Bishop of the same city, who had
been brought up under Atticus, was a careful Imitator of his Piety and Virtue‚
and exerciscd rather greater Moderation than his Master, being gentle towards
all Men, from a Perswasion, that this was a much more proper Method ¹than
Violence to reduce Hereticks to the true Faith, and therefore he never made
use of the imperial Power for this purpose. And in this he imitated weodostus
the Emperor, who was not at all concerned or displeased that any should think
differently of God from himself. However, the Number of Bishops of this
Temper was but small. Nothing pleased the generality of them but Methods
of Severity, and the utter Ruin and Extirpation of their Adversaries.
