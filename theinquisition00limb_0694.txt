264 The H1s‘ron‘t ofthe INQUISITION.

proach oi Evening, the Sentences of those who were to be delivered over to
the secular Court being begun to be read, his Friends repeated their Intrea-
ties, by which at last they overcarne his Constancy‚ so that desiring an Audi-
ence, and rising up, that he might be heard, he said, Come then let usgo and
confcss the Crimes I am falssy accused of, and thereby gralz'fy the Dqfires of my Ε’ἰεηῑίς,
And having confeffed his Crime, he was remanded to Jayl. Two Years
after he was sent to Evora, and in the A& of Faith walked in Proceffion
wearing the Samarre, on which was painted the Fire inverted, according to
the usual Custom of the Portuguese Inquisition 3 and after five Years more that
lie was detained in the Jayl of the Inquifition‚ he was condemned to the
Gallies for five Years.
v Finally, δίηται-ηας proposes and resolves a Qestion concerning another Case,
9· ἕξ. viz. ‘⁶ Whether an Heretick converted after a definitive Sentence‚ who says
“ that he will repent, and discover other Hereticks to the JudgeS, and is
‘⁴ upon that Account returned to the Inquifitors by the secular Judge, and
“ makesa full Confeffion before thern, isto be left again to the said secular
“ Judge. This Question in the former Age was a6iually debated by the In-
“ quisitors of Caenea, and after the supream Judges and skilful Men had been
“ consulted, they unanimoussy answered, that such a Penitent was not to be
“ left again to the secular Court3 both because he had made a true Confes-
“ lion before the Inquisitors, and therefore ought not to be delivered up by
“ them, and because the secular Judge seems to renounce his own Right, by
“ delivering to the Inquifitors the Heretick that had been turned over to
‘⁶ him.'' Add to this, that ’tis neither consistent with Goodness nor Equity,
that he who is now neither impenitent nor relapsed, should, upon any Ac·-
count, be delivered over to the secular Power.

cerning the Contempt of the World, the Miseries of this present Life, and
the Joys and Glories of paradise, do afterwards, in the Name of the Birhop and
Inquisitor, discover to him, that inasmuch as heis relapsed, he can’t escape
