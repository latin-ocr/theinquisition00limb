'honourably received his Images, which he sent to Rome. And having thus
wickedly possessed themselves of this unrighteous Power, the Popes as wickedly
used it, soon brought almost the whole Christian World into subjection to thern,
and became the Persecutors General of the Church of God; proceeding from
one Usurpation to another, t.ll at last they brought Emperors, Kings and
Princes into subjection, forcing them to ratify their unrighteous Decrees, and
to punish, in the severest Manner, all that should presume to oppose and con-
tradict them, till she became (lruaken with the Blood of the Samis, and with the
Blood of the Martyrs of Jcfits. Babylon the great, the Mother of Harlots, and
Abominations of the Eartl).
The Inquisition is the Master-piece of their Policy and Cruelty 3 and such an
Invention for the Suppreffion of Religion and Truth, Liberty and Knowledge‚
Innocence and Virtue, as could proceed from no other Wisdom but that which
is earthly, sensual, aad devilifh. And as the History os it, which Inow present
my Reader with in his own Language, gives the most perse& Account of the
Laws and Praetices of this accursed Tribunal, Ishall not enter into the Detail
of popish Persecutions, especially as we have a full Account of those prastised
amongst our selves in Fox and other Writers, who have done Justice to this
Subject. I shall only add a few Things relating to the two other general
Councils, as they are stiled by Ecclesiastical HistorianS.
Pht-invit· Under Heraclius, the Successor of Phocas, great Disturbances were raised
Honor-ii ¹· upon Account of what they called the Heresy of the Monothelites‚ i. e. those
who held there were not two Wills, the Divine and Human, in Christ, but
only one single Will or Operation. The Emperor himself was of this Opi-
nion, being persuaded into it by Pyrrhus Patriarch of Constantinople, and Cyrus
Bishop of Alexandria. And though he afterwards seems to have changed his
Mind in this Point, yet in order to promote Peace, he put forth an Edi&
*forbidding Disputes or Qarrels, on either fide the Question. Constans, his
Grandson, w'a's of the same Sentiment, and at the Instigation of·Paul Bishop
os Constantinople‚ grievoussy persecuted those who would not agree with him.
Plat.invit.Martyn, Pope of Rome, sent his Legates to the Emperor and Patriarch to
Mart. forsake their Errors, and embrace the Truth 3 but his Holiness was but little
regarded, and after his Legates were imprisoned and whipped, they were sent
into Banishment. This greatly enraged Martyn, who convened a Synod at
Rome of 150 Bishops, who decreed, that whosoever should not confess two Wills,
and two Operations united, the Divine and the Hmnan, in one and the same Christ,
fhould be anathema, and that Paul Bishop of Constantinople, should be condemn-
ed and deposed. The Emperor highly resented this conduct, and sent Olym-
pius Hexarch into Italy to propagate the Monothelite Doehine ; and either to kill
Martyn, or send him Prisoner to Constantinople. Olympius not being able to
⁴execute either Design, Theodorus was sent in his room, who apprehended the
Pope, put himin Chains, and got him conveyed to the Emperor, who after
jonominioussy treating him, banished him to Pontus, where he died in great
{ff'ffssffiffiisery and Want. The Bishops of Constans’s Party were greatly assistant
