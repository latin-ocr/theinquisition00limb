who should go on to corrupt the People of the most holy. Catholick Church by
any evil, and false Domine, to Anulinus the Pro-Consul, and Patricius, to
whom he had niven Instrustions on this Affair‚ that is they persevered in such
Madness they chiiglzt be punished according to his Orders. ’Tis easy to guess
what the Catholick Faith and Church meant, viz. that which was approved·
by the Bishops, who had the greatest Interest in his Favour.
nevit⁴ As to the Heathens, soon after the Settlement of the whole Empire under
Consiste-his Governrnent, he sent into-all the Provinces Christian Prefidents, forbidding

such of them as were Christians the Honours due to their Charafilers and Sta-
tions ·, hereby endeavouring to support the Kingdorn of Christ, which is not of
this World, by Motives purely worldly, viz. the Prospects of temporal Pre-
serments and Honours 3 and notwithstanding the excellent Law he had before
published, That every one should have free Exercise of his own Religion, and
worship such Gods as they thought proper, he soon after prohibited the old Reli-

clares in his Letters afterwards, written to all the several Governors of his Pro-
}bid.c.56.vinces‚ that though he wished the Ceremonies osthe TempleS, and the Power
of Darkness were wholly removed, he would force none, but that every one
should have the Liberty of affing in Religion as he-pleased.

'Tis not to be wonder’d at, that the Persons who· advised these Edists to
suppress the ancient Religion of the Heathens, should be against tolerating any
other amongst themselves, who should presume to differ stom thern in any Ar-
ticles of the Christian Religion they had espoused·, because is erroneous and
false Op-inions in Religion, as such, are to be prohibited or punished by the
Civil power, there is equal Reason sor persecuting a Christian, whose Beliefis
wrong, and whose Prastice is erroneous, as sor persecuting Persons os any
other salse Religion whatsoever ·, and the same Temper and Principles that lead
to thelatter, will also lead to and justify the former. And as the Civil Magi-
strate, under the Direffion of his Priests, must always judge for himself what:
is Truth and Error in Religion, his Laws for supporting the one, and punish-
nng the other, must always be in Consequence os this Judgrnent. And there-
fore ifConstautine and his Bishops were right in prohibiting Heathenism by Civil
Laws, because they believed it erroneous and-false, Dioclcssan ant} Licinius, and
their Priests, were equally right in prohibiting Christianity by Civil Laws,
because they believed it not only erroneous and false, but the highest Impiety
and Blaspherny against their Gods, and *even a Pmofof Atheism it self. And
