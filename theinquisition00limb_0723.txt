When the Inquisitor is determined to pronounce the Sentences os certain
Cr-iminals, he fixes on some Lord's-day or Festival to perform this Solemnity.
But they take Care that it be not Advent Sundczy, or in Lem, or a very solemn
Duy, such as the Nativity of our Lord, Easter, and the lil<e3 because 'tis not
decentthat the Sermons on those Days should be suspended, but that every
one should go to his own Parish Church. A certain Sunday or Festival there-
fore being appointed, the Parsons of all the Churches of that City or Place‚ ’
in which this Solemnity is to be performed, do, by Command os the Bishop
and Inquisitor, when they have done preaching, publickly intimate to the
Clergy and People‚ that the Inquisitor will, in such a Church, hold a general
Sermon concerning the Faith; and they promise, in the Name os the Pope,.
the usual Indulgence of 40 Days, to all who will come and see and hear the
Things which are there to be transaeted. They take Care to give the same
Notice in the Houses of those Religious‚ who commonly preach the Word of.
God, and that their Superiors should be told, that because the Inquifitor will
in such a Church make a general Sermon concerning the Faith‚ there·
fore he suspends all other Sermons, that every Superior may send four or two
Friars‚ as he thinks fit, to be present at the Sennon, and the pronouncing
the SentenceS. This Solemnity was· formerly called, A general Sermon con-
cerning the Fama, but 'tis now called, An An of Faz'th. And in this, great
Numbers of Persons, sometimes one or two hundred are brought forth in
publick Proceffion to various Kinds of Penances and Punishments, all wearing ·.
the most horrible HabitS. They chuse Festivals for this Solemnity, because
then there is a greater Confluence of People gathered together to see the Tor-
ments and Punishments of the Criminals‚ that from hence they may learn to
sear, and be kept from the Commiffion of Evil. Concerning this Rite, the Ma-
a'rid Instruffikion, An. 1561. c. 77. thus prescribes. When the Proceſjbs ff1³aram.l.30.

ment.

to the secular Court‚ the Bishop and Inquifitor give Notice to the Ballive os
