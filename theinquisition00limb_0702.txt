l 0⁹:1⁹ ,ηοξ afraid ohstt'ttcztc’ly⁸ to dmg,- his Faull, upon account of which he may bejudged
ιι Effe-ver ofHeretick5‚ or an Her-etich, and which 72< fully proved by PVitneffes, or
herber Pmoss, as long as he persis'ls in this Denirzl, tho’ otherwise he may pretend
(fonverssm, he is, wilhout Douhf, to be accounled an Heretick. For he is evidently
impertilem, who πῖθι-οι εωψὶγὲ his Sin. In Spain the same Opinion and Sentence
is openly declareu' for by the first Seville Instruction, An. 1484. cap. 14.
where also ’tis provided, that as often as such a Case should occur, the inquist-
tors should diligently inquire into the Life and Marners of the Witneffes.

Ing-va, An Heretick is alsojudged to be impenitent‚ altho’ he protests himself to be
0¹1)·'r³e‘l· a Behever, not only when he is convieted of the Heresy he hath said, but
· ζ’· 3· also of any heretical Faeh by which he may bejudged to be an Heretick, or
Γ· ‘⁶³‘ Believer of HeretickS. This is to be understood of one, who denies the here-
tical Fa& os which he is legally convic‘ted 3 and not of him who confeffes

such heretical Faet, but denies the evil Intention. And these are the Reasons
alledged why such a one may be condemned as an impenitent Heretick. Be·

-cause if the Heresy of such a Negative is fully and legally proved, it ap·

pears to the Church, that such a one is an Heretick‚ and therefore unless he
confesses and detests his Errors, he is deservedly delivered to the secular
court, as au impenitent Heretick. Befides, he who doth not admit the Er-

rors legally proved against him, doth not satisfy the Church‚ tho’ he protests

that he holds the right Faith‚ the Church first demanding Satisfaffion for the
Herefies proved, which he denies that he ever said. And therefore not being
amended, he may be condemned as an Impenitent, because Pardon of Sin is
granted to no one without Amendment. And finally, Confeffion is necessary

to true Repentance‚ nor doth he deserve to obtain Pardon‚ who doth not ac-
knowledge his Sin3 and therefore as a Negative doth not consess his Crhne, he

is accounted as Impenitent, and therefore is deservedly to be left to the secu-

lar Court. Nor Zet any one affirm, says Pegna, that he is by this Means unjustly
condemned, nor complain of the Ecclefiallical Judggs, or of the Judgment of the
Church which hath thus determined‚ and which doth not judge of any ffhing that is

secret. But if it should happen that any one is conviHed by false lVitneffies, let him bear

-it with Patience, and rejoyce that he fitffers Deathfor the T ruth. But before such

a Sentence can take place, 'tis, according to their Doctrine, required: First,

vthat the Person be convieted either of true and formal Heresy‚ viz. saying

there is no Purgatory‚ and not of a scandalous, rash or ill-founding As-
semion, and the like·, or of F acts from which arise Heresy or Apostacy.

And here there is Need of great Prudence. Secondly, 'tis required that the
heretica} Words, of which a Negative is convieted, be certain and clear, and

not dubious or doubtful, capable of a double Sense, one heretical, the other
catholick3 because as doubtful Expreffions are to be interpreted in the best

Sense, the Catholick Sense is to be received, and the heretical Sense re-

je&ed. Thirdly, that one guilty of an Heresy which he denies, be convieted

by legal and proper Witnesse3‚ above all Exception‚ and not by Enemies, or

single Witnesses‚ or others unfit. Fourthly‚ that the heretica] Fa& or
Saying, of which the Crimina] is convicted, be lately done, and not an old
Mamer,
