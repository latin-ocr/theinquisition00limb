The H1s1-0mc of the INQUISITION.

“ after that the pernicious Hereticks of our Time are found to have infecte&
‘⁶ not only antient, but even some noble Christians with their Impiety, they
“ are not admitted to be reconciled at the last Moment when Sentence is to
“ be pronounced, because then they ask Pardon rather thro’ Fear of immedi—

κ ate Dcath, than willingly and from the Heart, and being thus but seigned
f} Converts, may do a great deal of Mischief.

C H A P. XXVII.
How the PRocEss is ended by Absolution.

Aving said these T hings 'rn general, it now remainS, that we distinfflyv
H explain how every Process is finished.

The first Manner of ending a Process in Causes of the Faith, is by Abso-
lution‚ when the Criminal is not found guilty. And this may happen two·
wayS, either because he was really found innocent, the Informers and· Wit-
neffes bein—g found guilty of F allhood, or because the Accusation against him
was not full roved.

If heis foi'uib innocent after the first Manu-er, especially· if the Witnefl'es
have retracted their Depofitions, then he may be pronounced innocent. And

2. . Δ. in this Case, as Paramus tells υς, the accused Person, whose Innocence ap-
1 tm ·pears, rides upon an Horse, amidst theApplause of the People‚ crowned with·

Laurel‘ and Palm-Branches‚ after the Manner of a Triumph.
Ifhe is not found guilty, after the second Manner, because he is not con·

1 1.vi‹‘].·ed neither by his own Confeffion, nor the Evidence of F aet, nor by the

legal producing of Witneffes, and is not otherwise found to be suspeffited, nor
publickly defamed for the aforesaid Crime, he· is absolved by the. Bishop and
Inquilitortogether, or by either of them separately.

mm, ΠΧ, For that the Prisoner cannot be condemned in such a Case, is expressly de-

termined by the Council of Biterre, c. 11. and* by that of Narbonae, c. 2 3·-
But proceed to the Condemnation ofno Person, without· his own Confcffion, or clear

'and open Proofs ·, for 'tis better to stcffcr a crime to go unpum‘shed,⁴ than to condemn,-

the Innocent.

In such a Sentence of Absolution there is no mention made of the Herefies
or Crimes, for which such Person is accused or informed against, because
they are not proved. This hath been provided for by the Madrid InstruCtion,
An. 1561. c. 62. whether it be pronounced upon a Person dead-or alive. When
he who defends the Memory and Reputation of a Perstm deceased, hall) legally main·—
tained his Caufh, aad the deceased Person is to be absolved from any farther Trial, lois
Sentence shall be pronouncedz'n the publick All, because the Edias were published·
against him. However, in this Case, the Statue of such deceased Petson who is- ab·—
filved in the publick Ast, shall not be brought forth, nor shall the parti-cularErrors
