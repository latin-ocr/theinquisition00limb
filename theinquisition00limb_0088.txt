1- ζ’. Se& severely, and was of Opinion, that their Synagogues should be [evelled with the
271 §- Ξ· Ground, their Houses destroy'd, their Books of Prayer, and of the Talmud‚ ancl
even those of the Old Testament, be taken from them, their Rahbi’s be forbid w
teach, and forced, by hard Labour, to get their Breuci ; and if they would not sub-
mit to this, that they fhould be banished, as was formerly prafflised in F rance and
S ain.
ι. 3· Stet. pThis was the Moderation of this otherwise great and good Man, who was,
{2¹5 ¹25·indeed against putting Hereticks to Death, but for almost all other Punish-
(¹⁶¹³''s'y’ ments that the civil Magistrate could infliet : And, agreeably tothis Opinion,
he persuaded the Electors os Saxony, not to tolerate, in their Dominion, the
Followers of Zuimglius, in the Opinion of the Sacrament ; because he esteem-
ed the real Presence an effential or fundamental Article of Faith ·‚ nor to enter
into any Terms ofUnion with them, for their common Safety and Defence,
against the Endeavours of the Papists to destroy them. And accordingly,
notwithstanding all the Endeavours of the Landgrave of Heſje Caffl’l, to get
them included in the common Leagueagainst the Papists, the Elector would
never allow it, being vehemently dissuaded from it by Luther, Melanb‘ffon, and
1. 2, sest,others vof their Party, who alleged, That they taught Articles contrary to thofie
6. ς. 11. received in Saxony ·, and that therefore there could be no Agreement of Heart with
them. ln one of his Conferences with Bucer, he declared, That there could
be no Union, unless Zuz'nglius and his Party should think and teach otherwisef,
cursing all Phrases and ,Interpretations that tended to affert the figurative
seam, Presence only, affirming, That either thOst' of his own opinion, or thoſs.³ of
§· 47. ,Zuingliusu must be the Ministers of the Devil. On this Account‚ though Luther
swas for treating Zuz’nglius and his Followers, with as much Christian Friend-
ship as he could afford them, yet he would never own them for Brethren, but
looked on them as Hereticks, and preffed the Electors of Saxony not to allow

“ rSeveral also ofthe Anabaptists were put to Death by the Lutherans, for their
>obstinacy in propagating their Errors, contrary to the Judgment of the
Landgrave of Hff Caffel, who declared himselffor more moderate Measures‚
and for uniting all sorts of Protestants amongst themselves.
2-Calvin. John Calvin, another of the Reformers, and to whom the Christian W‘orld
is, on many Acconnts, under very great Obligations, was, however well
known to be in Principle and Praetice a Persecutor. So entirely was he
in the persecuting Measures‚ that he wrote a Treatise in Defence of them,
maintaining the Lawsulness of putting Hereticks to Death. And that by He-
retIcks, he meant such who differed from himself, is evident from his Treat·
ment of castellio and Servetus.
The former, not inferior to Calvin himself in Learning and Piety‚ had the
,Misfortune to differ from him in Judgment, in the Points of Predestination,
