270 The HtsTORY ofthe INQtrtstTion.

condemn them, admonifhz'ng them frequently by your sel-ves and others to confhſs ·, and
if {bey are finally obstinate in their Iffs‘ictea'mss, cause their Errors lo be pzsblickly
Hgslffed, in Detestanon of them, andleave them thus condemned to lhesecular Powers
fresam, or their Ballives, according to the Apostolick Commmzd. Herewith the
Aiadrz'd Instruffilion, An. 1561. &43- agrees. IVhen the Crimina! is negative,
(md hall) been legally convified of the Crime of Heress' of which he was accusbd, or
continues obstinate, ’tis evidentfrom the Law that he ought to be delivered to the fh.
[αἶαν Court. However, insuch a Casse’, the Inqvi zlors ought greatly to endeavour ’
his Com-etstan, that at least hemam diesin the Grace of God. And here they must do
all they caiz conststent with Piety. So that the Bishop and Inquifitor frequently,
sometimes both together, sometimes apart, must cause him to be brought
before them, to refute his Opinion8‚ and persuade him into the Faith of the
Church os Rome. If he doth not submit to their Information, ten or twelve
Persons are sent to him to instruet him, learned Men, Clergymen of diffe-
rent Religions, and secular Lawyers, who frequently converse with him, to
shew him that his Opinion is contrary to the sacred Scripture, and the De-
crees ofthe Church of Rome. If he is not converted, he is not immediately
delivered to the secular Arm, tho’ he defires it, but is kept in Chains a long
while, half a Year, or a whole one, in a hard and close Jayl‚ that by the
Misery and Distress of his Imprisonment‚ his Conflancy may be overcome.
In the mean while he is frequently admonished, that if he perfists he must be
burm, and after this Life burn in Hell Fire for ever. But if he is not mo-
ved by this Calamity, he is removed into a somewhat more comfortable
Jayl, and used in a little kinder Manner. They also make use of Promises‚
that if he will turn, he shall experience the Mercy of the Judges. If they
can neither prevail with him by this Means, they suffer his Wife and Chil-
dren, especially his little oneS, if he hath any, and his other Relations, to
come to him, to break his Resolution and Constancy. But if after all these
Methods used he perfists in his opinion, the Bilhop and Inquisitor prepare to
deliver him over to the secular Court. When therefore the Sermon concern-
ing the Faith is held, the Inquifitor causes his Faults and Herefies to be read
over by the Notary, or some other Clergyman‚ and then asks him whether
he will depart from his Herefies and abju re them? If he consents to abjure,
he is admitted3 and having made his Abjuration, he was condemned in the
Times of Eymerick to perpetual Imprisonment, because he was believed to
abiure rather thro' Fear of Death than the Love of Truth. And if he was a
Clerick, he was degraded from his Orders, by a verbal Degradation only,
ἑ. e. he was deposed from the Funffion of his Ministry.

But if in this condition he will not repent and abjure his Opinions‚ as is
¹commonly the Case with such persons, he is condemned as an obstinate Here·
tick, and as such delivered over to the secular Court. Cap. ad abolendam,

its Duty, some good Men, and zealous for the Faith, may attend him, and
„persuade him to the Catholick Faith, and exhort him as yet to turn from his
Errors„ And’tis the Opinion of Eymerick, that if even then he will be con-
