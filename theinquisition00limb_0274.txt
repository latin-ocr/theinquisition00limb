The Hrsromr ofthe INQulsn-roN.

Thus, from a Controversy originally of no Moment‚ rose up at length,
thro’ the Warmth of Men's Minds, a dismal Tragedy ·, and after the Pope’s
Authority began ro be called in question, a severe Persecution was raised
against the Beguins. In the Book of Sentences of the Tholouse Inquisition there
are several Sentences pronounced against the Begm'ns, by which they are de-
clared Hereticks, and delivered over as such to the secular Court. One of

these Sentences I will transcribe at large.

“ Peter Dominicus being examined, hath judicially confeffed all the Er-
“ rors of the Beguins. Item, He believes and afferts that the Lord Pope can-
“ not grant to the Friars Minors the Power of having Repofitories and Gra-
“ naries to keep Corn or Wine. Item, That he neither can nor could.
‘⁶ make or cause to be made such a Constitution or Declaration, and that it
“ ought not to be obeyed if made, because contrary to the Vow of the FrIars
“ Minors. Item, That he can’t grant to the Friars MinorS, according to
‘⁶ God, to carry great Habits, large or died. Item, That he cannot, by
‘⁸ his Plenitude of Power, make it lawful for a Friar Minor to become a Friar
“ of another Religion or Order‚ where he may have Poffesfions‚ or any
“ thing in common, and that a Friar Minor ought not to obeythe Pope in·
‘⁴² this, and that the Pope would fin in granting such a Dispensation. Item,
“ That the Pope can't give Leave‚ that a Friar Minor, when made a Bishop,
“ may become Lord of the Temporalties of his Bishoprick, or handle Money
‘⁶ with his Hand, because he ought to dispense and administer all moveable·
“ Effests by another to the Poor. Item, He believes and afferts‚ that the
‘⁴ Gospel of Christ is the Rule of St. Francis in Chastity, Poverty‚ and obedi--

‘⁶ ence, and that the Pope can't dispense with these three, or any one of them 3,
“- and that if he should grant a Dispensation, he would a& contrary to the

u Life of Christ, and against the Gospel. Item, That the Pope can’t dis-
“ pense in any Case, that any Person under the Vow of Virginity or Chastity,
‘⁶ whether that Vow be fingle or solemn, may marry 3 and that if he should
“ adtually dispense, he would herein fin, and not do according to the Power

“ the foresaid Case that such Person should marry, it would not be Marriage,
“ but Fornication or Adultery and Sin, and that the Children so born would
“ be adulterous and illegitimate. Item, That the Pope can’t make any De·-
“ creta] or Constitution which may dispense with the Vow of Virginity, or ’
“ Chastity or Poverty‚ in any Case whatsoever, altho' some very great Good
“ might hereby happ‘en to the Community‚ such as the restoring Peace to any
‘⁴ Kingdom or Province 3 and that if the Pope should make such Decreta] or
‘0‘ Constitution‚ it ought not to be obeyed, neither would he obey it. Item,=
“ He afferts that he believes and holds that the four Friars Minors who were·
