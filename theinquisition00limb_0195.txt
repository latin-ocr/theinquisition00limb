 

The HISTORY ofthe INQu1s1T1oNss 27

Name. fl'he Church now terrifies Men by Banishments and Jails, which was at
first believed in by Means of Banishments and Jails : She now relies on the Dignity
‘ff her Communicams, though at first consecrated hy the Terror of her Perfi’cutors: She
now puts her Priests to flight 3 though she was at first propagated hythe Flight of her
Priests, She now glories that fhe is heloved of the World 3 though she could not
belong to Christ, unleſs the bVorld hated her. And in his first Book to Con-
stantine, to the same Purpose. God rather chose to teach Men the Knowledge of
himself than forcihly demand it3 and hy gaining Authority to his own Precepts‚ hy
wonderful heavenly Work5‚ shew’d that he disdained a Mind compelled even to the
Acknowledgment of himself. If such a Method as this was made Use of to propagate
the true Faith‚ the Episcopal Dottrine should agree with it, and say, He is the God
of the whole World‚ and needs not a constrained Ohedience. He doth not require a
forced Confefflon .· He is not to he deceived‚ hut engaged : He is to he worfhiped‚ not
for his own sake, but ours. I can accept him only that is willing 3 hear him only
that prays‚ and heal him only that freely confcffi’s him. He is to he sbught with
'Simplicity of Mind, to he learn’d hy humhle Confieffion, to he loved with true Af-
feHion, to he reverenc’d with Fear, and his Favour to he Jecured hy an honest Mind.
But what strange ‘Ihing is this, that the Pricsts are fhrced hy Chains and severe
Penalties to fear God? T he Priests are kept in Prison3 the People are bound in
Chains 3 Virgins are stripp’d naked‚ and their Bodies‚ consecrated to God, expofied by ’
‚Way of Pumfhment to puhlick Vim, made an open Speetacle, and fitted for the
Torture.

Ambrose also taught the same Doffi'ffine. T he Apostles are not commanded t ament.
take Rods in their Hands‚ as Matthew writes. What is a Rod but an Enfignc ’,ἢ [⁴²¹⁶- ²·7‘
Power‚ and an Instrument of Vengeance to inflibt Pain ἒ And therefore the Dist-z- ‘¹' ⁶· ¹⁰⁸
ples of an humhle Master‚ I say of an humble Master, for in his Humility his
J udgment was taken from him, can only perform the Duty he hath enjoyned them
by Offices of Humility .· For he fient Persons forth to fhw the Faue, who should not
force Men hut teach them3 nor exercise Power, hut exalt the Dottrine of Humility.
And a little after he adds t When the Apostles would have had Fire from Hea-
ven, to consume the Samaritam, who would not receive our Lord Jesus into their
City3 he turned about and rehuked them, saying, Ye know not what Spirit ye
are of 3 for the Son of Man is not come to destroy Mens Lives‚ but to save
them.

Gregory Narianzen evidently lhews himself to be of the same Sentiment‚
although he hath not handled this Argument profeffedly : For having obser-
ved that Men were not eafily and at once, but ssowly and gradually, brought
-off from Idolatry to the Law, and from the Law to the Gospel 3 and having
confider’d the Reason of it, he thus speaks τ And why is it thus ? Because
we are to know, that Men are not to he driven by Force, hut to be drawn bv Per-
fwafion. For that which is forced is not lasting3 this even the Waves teach us,
>when they are repelled by Wolence3 and the very Plants when hent contrary to their
Nature. Thai which is voluntary is both more lasting and safe. This is 'agreeahle
to the Divine Equity 3 the other an Instance of Tyranny. So that he did not
'think it just even to do good to Men affinst their Will, or without their Jon-
