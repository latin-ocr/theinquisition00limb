242 The HI SToRY ofthe INQUISITION.

Inquis. The Prisoners, as soon as ever they are thrown into Jayl‚ are commanded
coan. to give an Account of their Name and Bufiness. Then they enquire after
‘ap' 13· their Wealth, and to induce them to give in an exast Account, the Inquifi-
tion promises them, that if they are innocent, all that they discover to them
shall be faithfully kept for, and restored to them 3 but that if they conceal any
Thing, it shall be confiscated‚ though they should be found not guilty. And
as in Spain and Portugal most Persons are fully persuaded of the Sanetity and
Sincerity of this Tribunal‚ they willingly discover all their Poffeffions, even
the most concealed Things of their Houses, being certainly persuaded, that
when their Innocence shall appear, they shall soon recover their Liberty and
Effeds together. But these miserable Creatures are deceived3 for he that
once falls into the Hands of these Judges, is stripped at once of all he was
possessed of. For if any one denies his Crime, and is convieted by a suffi..
cient Number of Witneffes, he is condemned as a negative Convict, and all
his Effecfis confiscated. If to escape the Jayl, he confeffes his Crime, he is
guilty by his own Confestim, and in the Judgment of alljustly stripped of his
Effects. When he is dismissed from Prison as a Convert and Penitent, he
dares not defend his Innocence, unless he defires to be thrown again into Jayl,
and condemned, and, as afeigned Penitent, to be delivered over to the secu-
lar Arm.
ρ.. Part. Of these Things J. Royas gives us an Account, “- When'any Criminal 13
Affert- 2· “ apprehended‚ and put into the Jayls of the Holy Office‚ his Effests must
‘⁶ be immediately sequestred, that they may not be conveyed away, or con-
“ cealed, and put into the Hands of some proper Person before the Notary
“ and Executor‚ who is to have the Custody and Care of them. Such Ef-
“ fects as cannot be kept, he who hath them in Custody, must sell by the
“ Inquifitors Command. This Sequestration is made only for real and formed
“ Heresy. From hence they infer, that this Sequestration or Description of
‘⁶ Effeets is not to· be made, when the Inquifitors proceed against Blasphe-
‘³‘ mers, or Portum-Tenem, or those who marry again whilst their former
“ Wives are living, or against Clergymen in OrderS, or profeffed Monks who
“ have contradied Matrimony, or against Persons who speak Pi-opofitions rash,
‘¹‘ scandalous, injurious, or that sound ill·‚ and in all other Causes‚ in which
“ there is not, dejure, any Confiscation of Effects, that which preceeds it,
“ viz. the Sequestration of such Effeets, by Consequence ceases.”
nzquz's. When the Prisoner is brought before his Judge, he appears with his Head
*GMw-cap· and Arms, and Feet naked. In this Condition he is brought out of Jayl by
the Warder. When he comes to the Room of Audience, the Warder goes
a little forward, and mal-:es a profound Reverence, then withdraws, and the
Prisoner enters by himself. At the farther End of the Audience Room there
is placed a Crucifix, that reaches almost to the Cieling. In the Middle of the
Hall is a Table about sive Foot long, and four broad, with Seats all placed
round it. At one End of the Table, that which is next to the Crucifix, s1ts
the Notary ofthe Inquisition, at the other End the Inquisltor, and at his left
Hand the Prisoner fitting upon a Bench. Upon the Table is a Miffale, upon
