TbeDEDICATION.

Rome, claiming to be the Vicar of Christ on Barth, makes
himself the Judge of the Paith, and usurps Dominion over
the Consciences of the Faithful. And of this the Office
of the Inquifition is the most abundant Proof. For here
the Pope‚ 35 supream Legissator, makes Laws7 by which
he endeavours to bind, under the most severe PenaltieS, all
who wear the Name of Christ, without excepting those
of the highest Rank, no not Princes and KingS, to obey
and believe all Things‚ which are established by the Ca-
110115 of the Church of Rome. And 35 supream Judge of
, the Faith, he ereE'ffi himself a Tribunal, from the Judg-
ment of which none of the Faithful are exempted .· He
sends his Inquifitors into all Provinces and CountrieS‚ wh0‚
35 Judges delegated by him, exercise Judgment in his
Name, and make all Magistrates and Princes obedient to
their Command5‚ as tho’ they were the Commands of the
Pope himself. And that it may appear that he sets himself

that if any one doth not immediately discover What he harh
heard and seen⁷ he shall be esteemed as an Accomplice in
the Crime, and 35 an Hinderer of the holy Office of the
Inquifition3 that by this MeanS, even from the smallest
ProofS, he may form 3 Judgment of the very Thought3‚

every Thing harbour’d in the Mind, or at least punilh the
Affion or word that gave Occafion to the Suspicion. And
