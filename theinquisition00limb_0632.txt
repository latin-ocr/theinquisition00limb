“ confists in debating on the principal Matter on one Side, and the other be*
“2 fleigntge Judge‚ and the putting in Answers either by denying or con-

“ But if any Thing be omitted, which is effential to such Trials‚ such as

‘¹ the Citation‚ the Term, and the receiving the Witnesses after Citation‚ and,
‚“ if the Sentences be not given in Writing, in proper, Place and Time,
“ with the usual Solemnities, all is void. And this is true also in the Crime
“ of Heresy ·, for by omitting any Acts which are effential, the Process even-
“ in Causes οιι the F aith would be destroyed.

Simcmcas hath given us a brief Account of the Manner of pronouncing Sen-
tences‚ which Ι sha¹1 here insert, because it fully represents to us the Method
which is usually observed in these Cases.

“ All the Judges are obliged to read the Sentences out of a little Book or

‘· ⁶0· §·¹·“ Brief, and must do it themselves, and not by others, unlessthey are illustrious*

“ PersonS, or in some Post of great Dignity. And therefore when the Inqui-
“ fitors have a Cause before them of more than ordinary Consequence‚ they

“ may pronounce Sentence by others, which must be done before the Clergy

“ and People‚ for Instrucstion, Warning and Terror, And this was for.-
“ merly the Custom in Spain.

‘⁶ The Forrn of aSentence of Condemnation is this.. First the Nature of
‘⁶ the Doctrine or Opinions afferted by the Criminal himself is declared 3 af-
“ ter this the diligent Inquiry that hath been made into his Crimes‚ the Ci-
“ tatium, Admonitions, Confeffions‚ legal Proofs, the Times given for Re·-
“ pentance‚ his Mind hardned in his Errors, his obstinate perfisting in them,
“ and all other Things‚ which may tend to ssaew that the Process which*
“ hath been carried on and observed against him hath been inst, are enume-
“ rated, All which Particulars being laid down in their Order, then sol-³
“ lows the Sentence it self, formed as the Nature of the Crime requires, ac-
“ cording to the Ecclefiastical Rules, containing the Condemnation of the-
“ Opinions, Authors‚ Books and other Matter-s.

“ Befides‚ in the Sentence of Condemnation, the Time must be declared..
“ from which the Crimina] fell into Heresy‚ that by a bare Inspefflon the-
“ Judge of the forfeited Effeets may know from what Day his Effeets are to:
“ be confiscated, which is provided by a certain Letter of the Inquisitor Ge-
“ neral‚ for- this Reason, that there may be no Need of looking over the*
“ whole Process on this Account, in which there are several Tlixngs which
“ ought to be kept secret. It is also provided by another Letter ofrthe Sea.
‘⁸ nate, that when the Judges and the Learned are deliberating about the
“ Sentence to be pronounced‚ they shall fix the Time of the Heresy‚ This
¹‘ Letter is printed amongst the InstruCtions, and dated from Granada, An„
(Ι 1499.

“ The Sentence, by which Persons lapsed into Heresy‚, are re-incorpora-2
“ ted into the Church‚ is in this Form. They are declared to have been He-
“ reticks or Apostates‚ and to have incurred the Penalties established by
ἴ Lavit, Butinafinuch as they say* they will return to the Church with a
