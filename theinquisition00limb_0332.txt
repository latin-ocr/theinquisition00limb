164 The H1sT0RY ofthe INQursrrlorr.

&semion by’our Apostolick'Writings, enjoining you, by the' Remiffion of your βίης, ,
to execute the ‘aforesaid Office, which‘we eonimit ‘to y'ou by our Apostolick Authority, q
in the L'o've of God, and withoutuny Fe‘ars of Men, putting' on the S piriz* of S't'rength ph
from on high. Sometimes he commits it to a Cardinal or Legate. ²⁵
¹ Heretofore the Pope ordinarily ranted it to the Master, and Provincial·
'Priors of the Predicants; to the enei-al ·and'Pr0vincia1s‚0f the Minorites‚

⁴ that they should take Care to provide Inquifitog}¹ of the F riars of their Order,
for the Places affigned to them, as we find it in eir Privileges‚ and as appears
from many Rescripts of th'e Popes, particularly InnOcent, Clement and Alexander
IV. which begin, Licet ex omnibus. We firmly charge and command your Discretion‚
by thefh Apostolick Writings, that with the Advice of some discreet Friars of your Or-
der, you chufi· eight of the said Order, fit for your Province, to perform this Work of
the Lord·, and that you strictly charge them, in Virtue of their holy Ohe'di'ence, hy
the Apostolick Authority‚ that they execute the Office of the Inquisition‚ ἃς, And
they give this Reason, because they are presumed to have greater Knowss
ledge of their own F riars‚ and can therefore more ealily judge who are the
most proper to be advanced to so high an Office. But at this Time the> Apo-
stolick Inquifitors throughout Italy are not chosen by the Prelates of the afore-
said Orders, but either immediately by the Pope, or by a Brief, as the In-
quifior at Milan and Genoua are chosen ς’ ὀῖ by Letters Patents from the Cardi-
nals‚ Inquifitors General over the whole Christian World. In Spain the Presi-
dent of the Inquifition appoints the lnquifitors.

722 9· And as the Power of the Inquifitor depends on the Pope, so no one can be
removed from this Office, but by the Pope alone, and those to whom his
Holiness commits this Power. F ormerly he granted the Power to the Gene-
ral and Provincia] Masters of the Orders‚ as appears from these Letters‘of
Innocent. ’ ” ’

ω’ with the sweet Savour of your order, we deservedly beor on especial Favour towards*
it, with full Defire wishing its Advancement‚ and endeavouring 'with our most di-
ligent Care to procure for it Peuce and other Blefflngs, by which it may obtain through
the Lord the (lefired Encrease. For this Reafhn we have yielded to your Request‚ that
you, Brother John, Bifhop and Meister, and your Succcffirs, the Friars of your
Order, who are or shall be deputed by the Apostolick See to preach the Croſs, orto
inquire against heretical Pravity, or any other such Affhirs, moy la-aefully andfreely
set ofide, or recall, quite remove and enjoin them to forhear, ancl substitute others ih
their Room, ass fholl fhem expedient to you, and exercise the Ecclefiostical Censure
against all 'Contravener5. And hy Authorz'ty of these prefint, we grant, that every

Provincia] Prior of the same Order may αὲἳ in like Manner in his» Province, as to
'the -Friors of the find Order, to whom this Affair may hoppen to be committed by
the some See. Dsztecl at Lyons, June Id. 5. and third of our Pontificate„

But now the Cardinals, Inquifitors General in Christendom, remove and
change, and transsate them from one Place to another, as they think. con·
