This Pilgrimage the Penitent is injoined to make, with a black Habit‚
which he must carry with the Inquifitors Letters, to that Place which he is to
vis1tin his Pilgrimage3 and heis farther required to bring back Letters te-
stimonial of the Predicant Friars, or others who dwell there in Witness of
the Truth.

Sometimes they were injoined Pilgrimage‚ to go to War in the Holy
Land against the Saracens. Thus the Council of Biterre hath determined,
that such who have thus offended the Faith or Church, shall also defend it for a
Time, to be appointed at your Pleasure, either by themselves or others morefit, on
the other or this Side the Sea, against the Saracens, or Hereticks and their Favou-
rers, or such who otherwise rebel against the Faith ancl the Church. And after-
wards, as to those whoshallbe injoined Pilgrimages, they shall be obliged to fhew
lhesaia' Testimonial Letters in each of their Pilgrimages to him, who presides over
the Church which they vifit, and to bring back the said Letters to you, in Testimony
of their having made such Pilgrimage. As to those who go beyond Sea, let them, as L
soon as they can, after their ‘Transportatiom present themselves, with your Letters, to
the venerable Fathers the Patriarchs of Jerusalem, and Acte, or to any other Bi·
shop whatsoe-ver, or to their Vicegerent‚ and let them bring back to you at their Re·
turn the Letters of every such foreign Bifhop, in theſs of their having laudibly
peiformed their Pilgrimage there. An Instance of such a kind of Sentence we
have in the Book of Sentences of the Tholouse Inquifition, pronounced against

so1.142· &Marcet William Garrici, Profess‘or of Laws at Carcaffone, who was condemned
to go to the War in the Holy Land, or if he was legally prevented‚ to send,
at his own Charge and Expence, another proper Soldier to the Relief of the
said holy Land. And as for himself, he was within thirty Days to depart
out of the Kingdom of France, and to stay in the Place affigned him, till
there should be a Transportation into Afia; to which was added the Punish·
ment of perpetual Imprisonment, if he refused to fulfil this Penance. ⁷

Secondly, Sorne Penances are honorary, attended with Infamy to those who
ῥά them. Such are, walking in Procession without Shoes, in their Breeches
and Shirt, and to receive therein ubl'1ck Discipline by the Bishop or Priest, to
be expelled the Church, and to fiand before the Gates of the great Church ι
upon solemn Days, in the Time of Mass, with naked Feet, and wearing up-
on their Cloak an Halter about their Neck. At this Time they only stand
before the Gates of the Church, with a lighted Candle in their Hand, during
the Tgme of solemn Mass on some holy Day‚ as the Bell is ringing to
Churc .

Besides these, they now use the Punistiment of Banishment, and Criminals
are banished not only into such Places as are subje& to the jurisdiction of the
inquisitor who banilhes thern, but to Places subje& to other InquisitorS, be-
