‘² that you have kept upaCorrespondence with certain German Mathemati-
“ cians concerning the same. Likewise that you have published certain
‘⁶ Lerters concerning the solar Spots, in which you have explained the
“ same Doctrine as true, and that you did answer the Objeffions, which in
“ several Places were made against you, drawn from the holyScripture, by
“ glosling the said Scripture according to your own Sense, and finally, where-
“ as there hath been ffiewn us a Copy of a Writing, under the Form of a
“ Letter, which is reported to be written by you, to one who was formerly
“ your Scholar, in which you followed the Hypotheses ol Copernicus, contain„

“ holy Scripture.

“ This holy Tribunal therefore being willing to provide against the Incon-

“ veniencies and Dangers which have proceeded and increased upon this Ac·
“ count to the Ruin of the holy Faith : By the Command of the said Ν. and of
“ the most eminent Lords the Lords Cardinals of this supream and universal In·-

“ ffhat the Earth is not the Center of the World, nor immovable, but moves
“ even with a daily Motion, is likewise an absurd Proposttion, and fals? in

“ 1616. that the most eminent Lord Cardinal Bellarmine should command
