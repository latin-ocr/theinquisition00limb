a* f The Har-oms ofthe INQU151T10N. 2'81

Ι eante, the Children orHeirs of the Deceased, or any others whom it ma
'¹' concern, are also cited by publick Ediets to come and make a legal De).¹
5¹ fence for him, and a legal Terrn is assigned thern tor their Appearance
l] After such Term is elapied, if no one of the afore-cited Persons appears·
the Inquifitors appoint one to undertake the Defence, a pious and faithful
Man, and fit for the Bufiness, who is to propose the legal Excuses and De-
fences for the Deceased. To this Person they communicate the Accusation
and Evidence against the Deceased, and injoin him Secresy‚ and to confer
concerning the Affair only with the Advocates of the holy Office, that so the
Process may be carried on according to the due Order and Course of Law.
But if any one appears, he is admitted to defend the Deceased’s Memorv.
Nor doth *it fignisy, if the Person appearing as Defendant in this Cause, be
noted for Heresy‚ or under Inquifition‚ or in Prison ; because as it may hap-
pen, that both the Deceased, and the Defendant under Inquifition‚ may be
both freed from the Prosecution carried on against them, 'tis allowed him
that no Prejudice may be done to any one, and because it may be for his
own Advantage‚ to appear in Desence of the deceased Criminal‚ according as
the Madrid Instruction hath determined in the afore-cited Place. And far·
ther, the Avila Instrustion, An. 1498. cap. 4. determines, That the Process
against a dead Person shall be speedily finished, and that the Inquzfitors fhall not put
qff the Causefor want ofProos} unless poffibly 'tis likely, that within a little while,
other kind of Proofs may ariste. But when the Criminal is not convieted upon full
-Proof, he is immediately to be absolved. And the afore—cited Instruetion gives
this Reason of the Decree 3 because unless it were thus, the Sons and Daugh·
ters of the Deceased under Prosecution, if his Cause should be put off, would
not poffibly find any Persons to marry with, and could not dispose of the Es-
feEts lest by the Deceased. But if after the Deceased is absolved there appear
new Witnesses against him, there may be a new Aetion commenced against
him, because, in this Crime, in Favour of the Faith, Sentences pronounced
are not to be taken as an adjudged Case. And the former Evidences also shall
retain their intire Force, and be added to those which arise anew, in order to

make full Proof.

When all these Things have been duly observed, is it appears that the De-
-ceased is to be absolved, the Sentence of Absolution is publickly pronounced,
because as publick Edists were set forth against him, at the Beginning of his
Process, he is therefore to be publickly declared absolved‚ that he may be
restored to his Reputation. But if his Memory is to be condemned, he is pro-
-nonnced to have died in Heresy‚ his Memory is condemned, his Effests con-
fiscated‚ his Bones dug up, and if they can be distinguished from the other
Bones of Catholicks‚ to be publickly burnt.

And thus we read that the Bones and dead Bodies of several Hereticks have Bmvg„
been unburied and thrown away, or burnt. Peter John, of the Diocese ossi. ¹¹99:
