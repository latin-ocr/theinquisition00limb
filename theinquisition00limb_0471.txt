Of the BelieversofHERETmKs andos SCHISMATICKS.

some Defenders, and others F avourers of Hereticks. The Believers of He-P· 2· q. 5 0=
reticks are, some of thern, they who believe their Errors and Heresles. Such are
excommunicate. Others are judged to believe the Errors of Heret1cks‚ from
their Words or AstionS. By their Words, viz. by their own Confession, when
they say they believe such an one’s Errors. Or by the Evidence of the Ρεῑᾶ,
viz. by ‘publickly preaching or defendingtheir Errors. ‚0¹⁴ by legally produ-

by what Faers any Persons could be judged to be Believers of Hereticks. But
the Council of Narbonne hath determined it. Cap. 29. Among st those Faults hy which
they may he judged to be Believers of Hereticks‚ these, to prevent your farther Douht, we
firinly think to be such, viz. if they have done Reverence to Hereticks‚ or, as be„
lieving them, have implored their Prayers, declarecl them to he good Men, and have
thus as it were adored them. If without any Defign to betray or seize them, or any other
excusahle and commendable Cause, they have been present at their C onfhlation‚ when they
falſsely and deceitfully pretend, that they save him by the Imposttion of Hands, whom they
comfort, though herehy they make him an Heretick. Or at their Service, when they ima-
gine that their Principal‚ holding an open Book in his Hand, gives them Remiffion of their
Sins, as in a general Confeffion. Or at the Supper of the Valdensts, when, on the
Day of the Supper, the ‘Table isset, and the Bread placed on it, and he believes,
according to their damnahle S ett, that when one of the Valdenses blcffes it, and breaks it,
and gives it to thoje present, he makes the Body of Christ. If they confess their S ins to
the said Valdenses, as a Person uses, and ought to confess to his proper Pricst. If
they knowingly and damnahly receive from Hereticks or the Valdenses Peace, or Bread
hlcffid hy them, sent or given them hy any one whatsoever. If they have believed that
they may be saved in their Sea, or that they are good and holy Men, or the Friends
or Meffi’ngers of God, or of good Conversation and Life. Or that their Persecutors
fin. Or if they have st> far praised them, or hy any other Sign or Wrd have pro-
feffed that they give them Credit or Belias, in a Case of Law or otherwise. If they have
willingly and ostentimes received them, heard them, vistted them, gave them, or sent
to them Provifion or other Thing53 or have learnt Prayers, Epzstles or Gospels from
them. ‘These ‘Things and the like, although they will not prove fingly, yet will be of
great Service3 especially as St. John hath said in his Epistle, If any one comes to
you, and brings not this Dotirine, receive him not into your House, nor bid him
God speed; for he who bids him God speed, partakes of his evil Works. But
we would have all these ‘Things to be so understood, as to intend that such who shallbe
found thus culpahle, did know the Persons by whom these Yhings were done to be Here—
kass and Nixitldenses ·‚ and that holy Church goth declare them separated from the Um}
