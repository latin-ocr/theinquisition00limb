their Hypocrisy was discover’d, and, to create the greater Regard and Atss
tention to their Persons and Mess‘age‚ God saw fit to punish that Hypocrisy
with Death·

As to Elymas the Sorcerer, this Instance is as foreign and impertinent as
the other. Sergius Paulas, Proconsul of Cyprus, had entertained at Paphos one
Barjesus a Jew, a Sorcerer3 and hearing also that Paul and Barnabas were in
the City, he sent for them to hear the Dolitrine they preached. According-
ly they endeavoured to instruct the Deputy in the Christian Faith, but were
withssood by Elymas, who, by his Subtleties and Tricks, endeavoured to hin-
der his Conversion. St. Paul therefore, in order to confirm his own divine
Miffion, and to prevent the Deputy's being deceived by the Frauds and Sor-
ceries ofElymas, after severely rebuking him for his Sin, and Oppofition to
Christianity, tells him, not that the Proconsul ought to put him in Jail, and
punish him with the civil Sword, but that God himself would decide the
controversy, by striking the Sorcerer himself immediately blind, which ac-
cordingly came to pass, to the full ConviCtion of the Proconsul. Now what
is there in all this to vindi-:ate PersecutiOn? God punishes wicked Men for
Fraud and Sorcery, who knew their Hearts‚ and had a Right to punish the
Iniquity of them. Therefore Men may punish others for Opinions they think
to be true, and are conscientious in embracing‚ without knowing the Heart‚
or being capable ofdiscovering any Inlincerity in it. Or God may vindicate
the Chai-aeter and Miffion of his own Meffengers, when wickedly opposed
and denied, by immediate Jtidgments inflieted by himself on their Opposers.
Zl‘liei‘efore the Magistrate may punish and put to Deatl1‚ without any War-
rant from Coti, such, who believe their Miffion‚ and are ready to submit to it,
as far as they understand the Nature and Defign of it. Are these Conse-
quences just and rational ? or would any Man have brought these Instances
as Precedents for persecution, that was not resolved‚ at all Hazards2 to de-
fend and prac'tise it?

2 cmxv-§mas can be reasonably infer’d from hence in favour of Persecutiom merely

for :he sake of Opinions and Principles? In all these Instanoes, the Things
censured are Immoralities and Vices. The Person who was deliver'd by

such Examples, and any Infamy thrown on the Christian Name and CharaRer.
