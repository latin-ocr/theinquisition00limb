absolving Hereticks. Such a Case may however happen, viz. when any one
is absolved by Virtue of any Jubilee, in which the Pope grants the Power of

absolving from such a Crime: Or when an Heretick absolutely concealed, or

mental, is absolved, whose Heresy is afterwards discovered, and himself pro·
ceeded against. A like Case may happen in an Heretick‚ who being about
to die, repents, and because there is no room to reconcile hina to the Church,

according to the ordinary Course of Law, is absolved by some private Priest

when at the Point ofDeath‚ and afterwards recovers3 or if he doth not re-
cover, is accused after his Death to the holy Office.

In these and the like Cases they say, that if any one will make use of the
Testimony of a Confeffor, yet the Inquisltor ought not to neglect the Course
os Law upon account of such a Witness. Gregorc?¹ XIII. in a certain Bull of
Jubilee, An. 1572. declared, That Persons absolve in the penitential Court, are
'to be looked on as absolved only in that Court or Judgment‚ and that therefore
they ought to make Satisfafflon in the external orjudicial Court. And therefore
now no Person receives any Advantage by excepting that he rece1ved Penance
in the internal Court. The Reason is, because penitential Puniffiment injoined in

the internal Court harh this Tendency‚ that hereby the Penitent may make Sa-

tissaftion to God and his Soul. Whereas temporal Punilhment regards the
Punishment of the Body, and is an Instance of publick Justioe, whereby the
Commonwealth is satisfied, which hath been injured by the ill Example of

n. the Offender. And as there is a double Punishment, so there is a twofold

Judge. One which injoins Penance whereby the Criminal may be freed
from eternal and spiritual Punishment, and this is the proper Priest; the “

,other he who injoins temporal Punishment, and this is the Judge of the Place
,where the Offence is committed, or also the ordinary Judge ol the Offender.
,Hence it follows, that as the Priest is not the proper Judge of this Crime,

but the Inquifitor and Bilhop, Absolution given by a Priest can’t hinder the
Process of the proper Judge.

However‚ no Affion is to be carried on against a dead Person, or rather
his Memory is not to be condemned, unless the Proof be full, according as
'tis determined by the Instruffion of Avila, An. 1498. c. 4. Nor let any dead
Person be cited to a Trial, nor any Process be carried on against his Memory or Repu-
tation, unless there befull Prooftoat he may hethereby condemned. When therefore
there are any such preceding Prool‘S‚ the Fiscal instantly demands, by put-
ting in a Bill‚ that such a Criminal may be proceeded against. This Accusa-
tion is exhibited to the Children or Heirs, or others whom it may concern,
that the Memory of the Deceased should not be condemned, and if there are
any Descendants ofthe dead Person, they are personally cited to defend his
Memory, according ro the Madrid Instruction, An. 1561. c. 61. Thus also
the Council of Biterre formerly ordained, c. 18. Proceed in like manner to
the Condemnation of Hereticks or their Believers, who have not been cano-
nically reconciled before their Deam, giving first a Citation to their Heirs, ον
others, who, according to Low, ought to be cited, and allow them a proper·

Libet-ty of defending themr And that no one may pretend Excuse or Igno·
