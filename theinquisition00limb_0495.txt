to determine which of the Proofs is valid. Others say, that either the
Witneffes on both Sides depose concerning the Person’s CharaCter‚ as to the
same Place and Time, and then the most credible Witneffes are to be be-
lieved; or the Witnesses on both Sides are equally credible, and then the
greatest Number must determine 3 or the Number of them is equal‚ and then
the most probable Proof is to take Place, and that Proof is to be accounted
the most probable, which adds Weight to the Cause by any like Fre<
sum tion.

Tfhe Punilhment of one thus defamed is Canonical Purgation, and some
other ordinary Penalty. Cap. Excommum'camus itaq, Extra. de haeret. §. Ad-
jicimus, when the Delamation is fully proved. But if it is not fully proved,
the Person cannot be compelled to a Canonical Purgation‚ unless there be
fuller Proof, and other Signs and Tokens concur with the Defamation. They
say ’tis the same, if the Infamy arises from Rivals and Enemies. This
is sufficient to give a Beginning to the Inquifition‚ but not to enjoin Canoni-
cal Purgation‚ unless what they say be probable. Sometimes also Persons are
defamed for Heresy upon this Account‚ that they have lived in Places defa-
med or suspected of Heresy‚ and from thence have come amongst the Pa-
pists. In this Case the Synod of Sallzbourg, held two Ages ago, hath de-
creed : The Parzfh Priests ought also to observe those who come from the Countries ofc'onstit. 6„
