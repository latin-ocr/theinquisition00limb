semi.. And in the Poem of his own Life, he speaks to the same Pur-
poe:

Perswafion's much more Just than Violence 3
Fitter for us, and those whom we attempt
To reconcile unto the Being Supream .-
What hy Compulfion’s done can never last.
Like as the hending Bow, and Stream repelt’d,
T he Force remov’d‚ by their own Power return
‘To native Form and Place, scorning Restraint.
That's only durable which is th' Effett
Of free Consent and Choice. Love leads the Way,
And steady keeps, by kind, yet powetful Influence.

Optatus Milevitanus writing against Parmenianus, the Donatist‚ vindicates
the Church from the Charge of persecuting Diffenters from it. For when
Parmenianus objeEted to the Catholicks : ‘Ihat cannot be called the Church,
which feeds on cruel Dainties, and grows fat with the Flesh and Blood of the Saints .-
Optatus thus answers him, l, 2. ‘The Church hath its proper Members3 the Bi-
fhops, Presbyters‚ Deacons, Ministers‚ and the Body of the Faithful. ‘Io which of
these different Orders in the Church can you impute what you objet't‘ ? Point out, tf you
can, by Name, any Minister or Deacon, or instance in any one Presbyter that hath
been concerned in it, or any Bishops who have approved it. What one amongfi‘ us
hath endeavoured to enfhare, or hath persecuted any Person ? Declare, if you can,
and prove one fingle Instance of Persecution hy us. In this Paffage he plainly
acknowledges, that the Church ought not to feed on cruel Dainties, and de-
nies that the Donatists can, with Truth‚ objest this to his own Church 3
though indeed, 'tis scarce to be believed, when one confiders the Ediets of
the Emperors against the Donatists, and other Hereticks. But he goes on,
and largely ffiews, that the Donatists themselves had fed on these cruel Dain-
ties, and feasted on Christian Blood; and at length concludes : See, your own
Party have made good what you your Jelf have confeffid, that that cannot he the
Church which‘feeds on cruet Dainties. Miffionary Dragoons‚ and ordained Bi-
fhops are vastly different. What you have falsely laid to our Charge, hath been done
P} othegs, not byd us ς and what you have owned to be unlawful to do, you your
eves ave aete .

What was Chryfhstom’s Sentiment in this Affair‚ he himself sufficiently de-
clares in his Sermon about Excommunication, where he thus inveighs against
those, who pronounced others accursed: I fiee Men, who understand not the
genuine Sense, nor indeed any thing of the sacred Writings, who, to paſs by other
Things, I am not ashamed to own, are Furious, Trifl'ers, Qtarrelsome, who know
not what they say, nor whereof they affirm 3 bold and peremptory in this one fitting,
ever determining Articles of Fauo, and declaring accursed, Things they understand not.
Upon this Account we are become the Scorn of the Enemies of our Faith, who ‘look upon
us as Perfhns that have no Regard for Virtue‚ and never learnt to do good. How
