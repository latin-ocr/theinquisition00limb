 

The H1sTORY ofthe INQUISITION. 125-

Farther the Macffid Instruffiom in the Year 1561. harh determined the
same, Ca’p. 66. In all Casts, in which the Inquifitors and Ordinary, or any of
them, differ in Opinion, either in the Determinatz‘on of a Caust‘, or (my other Ast,
or in cm Interlocutory Sentence, the Causte must he referred to the Council. But if the
Inquisitors [md Ordinary agree, their Decree must he executed, though the Counfiellors
differ, and should he more in Numher. There is also a Letter of the Counsel
in Poffeffion of the Inquifitors of Corduba ς by which it is decreed, That ifSimanc.
the lnquifitors and Ordinary Judge do agree, their Sentence is to be prefer-tit. 410-
red‚ although the Advice of all the Counsellors differ from it. For the Juris- §- 14·
diotion properly belongs to the Inquifitors and Ordinary Judge 3 and when
they have heard the Opinion ot the Learned, and thoroughly confidered the
Process of the Causes, and fully weighed all circumstances, they can much
better determine, and with greater Certainty. But as to the lnquifitors of Val-
ladolid, unless the Majority ofthern agree in the same Sentence, the Cause must
be referred to the Council, although the aforenamed Judges should be unani-
mous. In Portugczl the Counsellors have a decifive Vote, and subscribe their
Names together with the Inquifitors in the Determination of CauseS, and the
Sentences 3 and they are chosen under the same Conditions as the Inquifitorsswza,
are, excep-ring only that of being forty Years old, which is required by the13fl·4f·1·'
common aw.

But although this Power is granted to the Inquifitors, yet ’tis safer to followPegna‚

2 the Advice of the Skilful. To, this End they ought fully to communicatepart Ξ·

i the whole Process of Criminals to them. Per cap. Statum. ᾗ. Juhemus,‘⁰'⁷¹' ¹²8'
lib. 6. When the Bissaop proceeds before the Inquzfflom, or whether the Bishops or
Inquisttors proceed, if there can be conveniently had cz Number of le'tncff’s, let
their Names be declared to certain other wise and homst Persons, whom we order
to he called to this Service, and to whom the whole Process under Constderation must
be seriousty opened, and fully explained, and by whose Advice they must proceed to
Sentence or Condemnation. And thus, notwithstanding the Names of the thffis
be not declared to the Persons accused, let alt Credit he given to the Depofitz'on of the
said le‘tmff’s, and the Judge proceed upon such Information. 'Tis however a re-
ceived Custom amongst the Inquisitors, never to tell the Names of the Wit-
neffes to the Counsellors. 'Tis however the Duty of the Inquifitor to remark
the Qalities of the Witneffes·, as whether they be religious, ss<ilful, grave,
and approved, or whetherless approved, common Persons, poor, young, un-
skilful, and the like ·, that their Qalities being thus known, the Skilful may
more eafily understand what Credit is to be given to what they severally say,
and what not. If there be Reason to fear that the VVitneffes are Enemies to
the Criminal‚ the Inquifitors may in such a Case declare the Names both of
the &Vitnesses and Criminals ; because poffibly the Counsellors may know them
both ·‚ and whether they are, or have been Enemies. But to prevent any rash
Publication of this Matter, they may bind them by Oath, or under the Sen-
tence ofExcommunication, to keep it a Secret 3 because Secrecy, as they say,
is the principal Nerve of the Causes of the holy Office. Cap. eod. Alae (fa
