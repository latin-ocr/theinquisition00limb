,ι . The Oath being taken, the Denouncer is interrogated concerning various

⁵ Things by the Inquisitor. “ First, if he be not a well known Person, he is
“ interrogated concerning his own Name, Surname, Country‚ Employment,
“ and Placeof Abode. Then, how long he harh known N. against whom
“ he denounces? Likewise how he carne to know him? Again, whether he
“ observed that the aforesaid N. was suspected of Matters relating to the
“ Faith from his Words, or his Aetions? Likewise, how often he had seen the
‘⁶ said N. do or say those Things for which he thought him an Heretick, or
“ suspected of Heresy? Likewise, at what Time, and in the Presence of
“ whom the aforesaid N. did or said those Things of which he is denounced ?
“ Likewise, whether the aforesaid N. hath had any Accomplices in the afore-
“ said Crimes, or any Writings belonging to the Offences denounced ? Like·
“ wise, to what End and Purpose the aforesaid Things were done or said by
“ the aforesaid N. whether serioussy, or in Jest? If it appears that there was
“ a long Interval ofTime between the Commiffion of the Crimes denounced,
“ and the making the Denunciation, the Inquisitor interrogates the Denoun-
“ cer, why he deferred so long to come to the holy Office, and did not depose
“ before, especially if he knew, that he incurred the Penalty of Excommuni-
“ cation by such Omiffion.'’ They account this Interrogatory neceffary for
two Reasons. F irst, because the Delay of Denouncing may give a just Pre-
sumption of Calumny in the Denouncer. Secondly, that it. may be known,
whether he hath been compelled by his Confeffor to denounce, upon his Re-
fusal to absolve him without denouncing, in which Case greater Credit is gi-
ven to the Denouncer. “ He is moreover asked, whether he knows any
“ Thing farther ofN. which concerns the holy Office, or of any other Per-
“ son? Likewise, whether he harh at any time had any Cause of Hatred or
⁸‘ Enmity with the aforesaid N. and whence it proceeded? With what Zeal,
“ and with what Intention he comes to the holy office, and to make Denun-
“ ciation? Whether he hath denounced thro’ any Paffion ofMind, ill Will,
“ Hatred, >or Subornation? And he is admonished ingenuoussy to tell the
“ Truth.’' He is especially interrogated how he came by his Knowledge,
because on that principally the Truth and Weight of the Testimony depends.
From the Denunciation, and the Answers to these Interrogatories they form
other Questions, that there may be nothing wanting in the Inquisition. And

§hatsoever the Denouncer answers to these Interrogatories, the Notary writes
own.

The Denunciation thus received, three Things are usually observed before
the Denouncer goes from Audience. First, the whole Denunciation, as writ-
ten down, must be read over to the Denouncer, that he may add, take away,
or alter as he pleases. Secondly, the Denouncer must subscribe to his Depo-
sition ·‚ or ifhe can’t write, he must at least put under it the Sign of the Cross.

Thirdly, the Denouncer must take an Oath of Secrecy. All these Things are
exaffly written down by the Notary.

Ifthro’ Straitness of Time, or a late unseasonable Hour, or the Length of
zhe Denouncer's Account, the whole Denunciation cannot be taken at once,
