his congregation, upon a Charge of Heresy3 and treated, by his OpposersJ
with ssiameful Rudeness and Insolence. Other Congregations were also
p1·a&ised with, to discard their Pastors, upon the same Suspicion‚ who were
accused of impioussy denying the Lord that bought them, to render them odious
to their Congregations, merely because they could not corne up to the unscrip-
tural Tests of human Orthodoxy. And when several of'the Ministers of
London thought proper to interpose, and try, if by Advices for Peace, they
could not compose the Differences of their Brethren in the West: This
Christian Defign was as furioussy opposed as if it had been a Combination
to extirpate Christianity it self; and a Proposal made in the Room of it,
that the Article of the Church of England‚ and the Answer in the Affem-
bly's Catechism, relating to the Trinity, should be subscribed by all the
Ministers, as a Declaration of their Palm, and a Test of their Orthodoxy.
This Proposal was considered by many of the Ministers, not only asaThing
unreasonable in it self, thus to make Inquifition into the Faith of others, but
highly inconsistent with the Charaeter of Protestants, diss'enting from the
national Establilhment3 and dissenting from it for this Reason amongst o-
thers, because the established Church expressy claims an Authority in Contro-
τεῦ-,βω of Faith. And therefore, after the Affair had been debated for acon-
siderable while, the Qiestion was solemnly put, and the Proposal 1·εῇεᾶεά
by a Majority of Voices. This the Zealots were highly displeased with, and
accordingly publickly proclaimed their Resentrnents frorn the Pulpits. Fasts
were appointed solemnly to deplore, confess, and pray against the abound-
ings of Heresy 3 and their Sermons direffly levelled against the two great Evils
of the Church, Nonsubscription and Arianism. Through the Goodness of God
they had no Power to proceed farther ι And when praying and preaching, in
tlt-is Manner, began to grow tedious, and were, by Experience, found to
prove ineffefituah to put a Stop to the Progress of the Cause of Liberty‚ their
Zeal immediately abated‚ the Cry of Heresy was seldomer heard, and the Ala-
rum of the Church's being endangered by pernicious Errors, gradually
ceased5 it being very observable, that though Heresy be ever, in itsNa-
ture, the same Thing, yet that the Cry against it is either more or less,
according as the political Managers of it can find more or fewer Paflions to
work on, or a greater or leffer Interest to subserve by it.

And thus have 1 brought the History of Persecution down 'to our own
Times. lf Church History would have afforded me any Thing better, Ι
afl'ure my Reader he should have had it told with Pleasure· The Story, as
it is, I have told with Grief. But 'tis Time to dismiss him from so un,
grateful an Entertainment, and see what usefulRefleaions we can make on,
