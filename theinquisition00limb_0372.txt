whitst they shall be engaged in the Prosecution of this Affair, ‚without the special Com-
mand of the aforesaid See, making full and express Mention of this Indulgence3 ,and
he decrees every “Thing done contrary hereto to be null and void. This Privilege is
granted them, that the Causes of Religion may not be forsaken or hindred by
the Excommunication of the Inquisitors, and other Ministers of the Office,⁴
and Hereticks in the mean while go unpunished >by such Hindrances of their

Orders of Predicants and Minors, that they may not be hindred by their Su-
periors in the Causes of Faith. If it should so happenthat the Master and ,Mini-

committed to you hy the aforesaid See, because the only Reaſsm why such Commiffion in
such Part is granted them is, that they are prefitined to have a more full Knowledge of ’“
