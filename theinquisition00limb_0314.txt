146 The Hrsroav ofthe INQU1s1r10N.

Matter had been debated in a Confistory'3 and that notwithstanding some Car.
dinals opposed it, the Pope seemed inclin’d to grant it, at the Instance of
Cardinal Carpi, who affured him, that it was necessary to keep the City of
Milan in Devotion towards the Apostolick See. This he did from a secret
Hope, cherilh’d by the Spanish Ambassador, that by this Means he would se-
cure the Favour of the King of Spain to make him Pope. Hereupon the Ci-
ties of that State, sent Slsrkvrzcz Marone to his Holiness‚ Coesar Taverna‚ and
Princifimle Bisa—sto to the Catholick King, and Sforza Brivio to the Council of
Trent. 'l'his'last they commiffioned to beseech the Prelates and Cardinals of
those Places to have Compaffion on their Country, which being already ren-
der'd miserable by exceffive Impositions, would be wholly ruined by this
which was worse than all the other ·, many Citizens already preparing to
abandon their Country‚ well knowing that that Office did not always proceed
in Spain, to heal the Conscience, but very often to empty the Purse ·‚ and for
other secular Ends also. And if the Inquifitors, under the King’s own Eyes,
do so rigidly dominere over their own Countrymen‚ what will they not do to
the Citizens of Milan, who are so far distant from any Remedy, and havea
much less Interest in their Affeffions. Brivio also declared at Trent, how
generally the Citizens were perplexed with this ill News, and besought the
Affistance of the Prelates. This Relation gave greater Uneafiness to the
Prelates‚ who had more to fear from the Inquifi'tion‚ than it did to the Se-
culars. The Prelates also of Naples were afraid, that if this Yoke were put
on the zwilaneze, they could not keep it off from themselves, as they had
done sor some Years before. And therefore the Prelates of the Milaneze met
together, and resolved to write Letters to the Pope, and Cardinal Borromeo,
subscribed by them all, fignifying how great a Prejudice it would be to him,
to whom it belonged 'as Archbiffiop, to preside in that Office. They put
the Pope in Mind, that there were not the same Causes and Respecsts as there
were in Spain, to put so rigorous an Inquifition amongst them ; which besides
the evident Ruin it would bring on that State, would be a greatPrejudice
to the holy See. For that he could not refuse to establiffi it in Naples also,
which would give Occafion to other Princes of Italy to desire it in their Do-
minions ·, and s1nce the Jurisdiction of the Inquifition extended over the Pre-
lates, the holy See could not expect much Obedience from them, because they
would be forced to secl< the Favour ofsecular Princes, to whom by this Means
they would become subject ε So that if there should be any Occafion for a new
Council, the Pope would find but few ofthe Prelates faithful to him, and sub-
je& to his Commands. Neither ought he to believe what the Sssmziards might
possibly alledge, that the Inquifition in Milan should be subject to that at
Rome, since it appears by Experience, how they proceeded in the Cause of
the Archbishop of Toledo, always refusing to transmit the Proceffes to Rome,
though it had been often demanded from them, as is practised also by the In·
quifitors of the Kingdom of Sicily, who depend on Spain. The Prelates not
content with these and other Reasons, alledg'd to the Pope and Cardinals,
and others in whom they had any Interest at Rome, did farther propose, that
