p. 2. ως. According to the Constitution of this Bull, very grievous Punishments are

§- 24· often inflisted on those who violate it. Carena relates from Farinacius, that a
certain Prisoner in the holy Office was hanged for killing his Keeper, in or-
der to make his Escape. He adds, That at Cremona, An. 1614. a certain
Jew was hanged for killing another Jew who had deposed against him in the
holy Office. And not only thus, but isthe Wound is not mot-tal, but ssight,
he says that he hath seen such Offenders sometimes condemned for ever to the
Gallies, or at least for ten Years. This was executed upon a certain Person
at Cremona, who had caned a Witness for depofing against his Brother in the
holy Office. His Sentence was publickly read to him in the great Episcopal
Hall at Cremona, Carena himself being present.

The same Carena gives us a Case, by which it will appear, that sometimes
those who terrify Witneffes, but yet don’t obtain their End, have been dis-
miffed with a severe Reprimand, and being put in mind of the before-mentioned
Bull. A certain Sergeant ofthe holy Office had a Meffage from the Inquisi-
tor to deliver to a certain Countryman’s Wife: The Woman not being
at home, the Sergeant would leave it with her Husband, upon which
the Countryman gave him several hard Names, and follow'd him with
''Weapons, crying out, Li scirro becco torna in dietro a tor il tuo precetlo.
'she Pope consented that the Cause should be tried before him, July 15,
1621. and the Sentence approved was, that the said Countryman had
incurred the Penalty of this Constitution, and that he was to be condemned ro
the Gallies for five Years ; with this Addition‚ That from the Goodness ofthe
Pope he should be heard, if he defired the Grace of Commutation, upon
consideration of the Plainness of the Man, and his conjugal Affedtion.

However, Carena adds a Caution, that from these Instances 'tis not law-
fui for the Inquisitors and Ministers of the holy Office, to make for them-
selves ageneral Rule, viz. that such who terrify the Witneffes ought to be

punished,
