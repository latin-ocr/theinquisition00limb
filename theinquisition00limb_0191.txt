“ Opinions, nor ordain ssiffiops or others. That some of them ssiould be

“ the Privileges of the City which other Citizens enjoy'd3 and that he or-
“ dained other grievous Penalties by his Laws, which he never executed:
‘⁶ For he endeavour'd not to punish, but only terrify his Subjecffs, and thus
“ to bring them into his own Sentiments of the Deity ; for he commended
“ those who were willingly converted.” The same &Vriter relates of Va—
lentiniasz, who enjoy'd the Empire with his Brother Valens. “ They werel. 6. c. 6,
‘⁶ both Christians by Religion 3 but differ’d in their Opinions and Manners.
‘⁶ For Valens, when baptiz'd by Eudoxius the Bishop, furioussy followed the
‘⁶ Do&rme of Arius, and was angry that he could not force all into his Sentia
‘⁶ ments. But Valentinian embraced the Nicene F aith, and favour'd those who
“ were of his Mind; but never injur’d any who were osa different Opini-

Emperor Theodosius persecuted none of them except EunomiUS‚ whom for guther-

As to the rest he offer’d them no Iujuries‚ nor forced them to communicate with himſseff 3
but permitted all to meet in their Conventieles, and to think as they pleased of the
Christian Faith. Some of them he fizffer'd to build themselves Oratories without the
Cities‚ but the Novatians to have their Churches within them, without fear3 be-
cause they held the same Sentiments‚ in Matters of Fama, with himseff. And he
relates of Atticus, Bistiop of Constantinople‚ ‘That he did not only preserve his owni, 7- ξ, 3;
People in the Fama, but even ficrpriz'd the very Hereticks by his wonderful Prudence 3
—that he had no Inclinatiou to perfhcute them, and that having once attempted to
