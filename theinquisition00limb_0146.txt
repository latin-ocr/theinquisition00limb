Siinplicity os it, and to pronounce an Anathema, i. e. to declare, in the
Name of his great Master, that all such false Teachers should be condemned
who continued to do so; and this is the utmost that can be made of the Ex-
preffion3 and therefore this Place is as impertinently alledged in favour of
Persecution‚ as it would be to alledge those Words of Christ: He that belie-
veth not, shall be condemned. The Anathema pronounced, was the divine Ven-
geance, it was Anathema M‘ammtha, to take Place only when the Lord should
come to Judgment, and not to be executed by human Vengeance.

As to Heresy, against which such dreadful Outcries vnave: been raised, 'tis
taken indifferently in a good or a bad Sense in the Scripture. In the bad Sense‚
it liguilies, not an involuntary Error, or Mistake of Judgment, into which
serious and honest Minds may fall, after a careful Enquiry into the Will of
God‚but a wilful criminal Corruption of the Truth for worldly Ends and Put-
poses. Thus'tis reckon'd, by St. Paul himself, amongst theWOrks of the Fleth,

Gal. v. ιο. such as Adultery, Fornication,Variance, Strifes, and the like, because Heresy is
embraced for the sake offlelhly Lusts, and always ministers to the servingthem.

Thus St. Peter, ‘There were falfi,² Prophets alst> amongst the Peme, even as there shall

ι Pet. ii. he false ‘l'eachers amongsl you, who privilyshall bring in damnable Herefies, even deny-
1› ἃς· —ing the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swfft fDestruHion ,· and ma-
ny shall follow their pernicious Ways, by reason of whom the Way of Truth shall be

ν. 10.evilspoke of; and through Covetousness shall they, with seigned Wrds, make Mer-
chandize of you3 whom he farther describes, as walking after the Flefh in the Lust

os Uncleannejs‚ and as given to almost all manner of Vices. This is Hereſjr, and

denying the Lordthat bought us, and the only Meaning of the Expreffiom as

used by the Apostle3 though it hath been applied by weak or defigning Men,

·‘1⁴{t.<iii. to denote all such as don't believe their metaphyfical Notion of the Trinity,
ror the AtlmnastanCreed. Hence it is that St. Paul gives it, as the general
*Charaeler osan Heretick, that he is subverted‚ viz. from the Christian Faith,

fintreth, viz. by voluntarily embracing Errors, subversive of the Gospel, in
favour ofhis Lusts, on which Account he is sels-condemn'd‚ viz. by his own
Conscience, both in the Principles he teacheS, and the vile Uses to which he

makes thern serve: So that tho’ sincere and honest Enquirers after Truth,
Persons who sear God‚ and practise Righteousness‚ may be Hereticks in the

Esteem of Men, for not understanding and believing their Peculiarities in Re-

ligion, yet they are not and cannot be Hereticks, according to the Scripture
Description of Heresy, in the Notion of which there is always supposed a

wicked Heart, causing Men wilfully to embrace and propagate such Princi-

ples as are subverfive of the Gospel‚ in order to serve the Purposes of their
Avarice, Ambition, and Lust· Such Heresy as this is unquestionably one of

the worst of Crimes‚ and Hereticks of this kind are worthy to be rejested. It

must be confeffed, that Heresy harh been generally taken in another Sense,

and to mean Opinions that differ from the established Orthodoxy, or from

the Creeds of the Clergy, that are uppermost in Power ς who have not only

taken on them to rejeft such as have differ'd from them, from their Commu-

nion and Church‚ but to deprive them of Fortune, Liberty and Life. But
