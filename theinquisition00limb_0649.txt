his Companions and Accomplices in his Crime, his Teachers and his Disciples,

for he ought to discover them, tho’ he be not interrogated; but when he is
interrogated concerning rhem, he is much more obliged to discover them
than his Accomplicts in any other the most grievous Crimes. A Person also§ σο.
Γυῖρεᾶεά of Heresy, and fully convifted, may be tortured upon another Ac-
count, i. c. to discover his Companions and Accomplices in the Crime. This
must be done when he boggles‚ or 'tis half fully proved at least that he was
actually present with them, or hath such Companions and Accomplices in his
'Crime3 for in this Case he is not tortured as a Criminal, but as a WitnesS.

But he who makes full Confeffion of himself, is not tortured upon a different
Account; whereas if he be a Negative‚ he may be tortured upon another
Account, to discover his Accomplices and other Hereticks, tho' he be fully
convi&ed himself, and it be half fully proved that he hath such Accompli-

ces. Instruit. Madrid. An. 1561. c. 45. The Reason of the Difference in these Royas
Cases is this, because he who confeffes against himself, would certainly much p. ι. '
father confess against other Hereticks if he knew them. But ’tis otherwise Affert. 340
when the Criminal is a Negative.

Whilst these Things are doing, the Notary writes every Thing down in the
Process, as what Tortures were inflieted, concerning what Matters the Cri-
minal was interrogated‚ and what he answered. If by these Tor-tures they
can't draw from him a Confeffion, they Ihew him other kind of Tortures‚
and tell him he must undergo all of them, unless he confeffes the Truth. If
neither by this Means they can extort the Truth, they may to terrify him
and engage him to confess, assign the second or third Day to continue, not
t-o repeat the Torture, till he hath undergone all those Kinds of thern to
which he is condemned.

The Degrees of Torture formerly used were five, which were infliCted in
their Turn, and are described by Julius Clarus. Know therefore, says be, thatpraff.
