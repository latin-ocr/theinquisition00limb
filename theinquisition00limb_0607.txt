 

The Hmromr ofthe INQUISIT10Nss ¹77

in general, but not the particular House or Room where. All these Things they
carefuliy avoid, that the Criminal may not by any Means discover who arc
the VVitness‘es or Informers against him. This they will in no wise suffer.
For as they generally say, Secrccy is the very Sinew ofthe Inquisition. Hence
'tis easy to infer, that many of those Interrogatories which are formed by the
Advocates of the Criminals, are not allowed, because they must relate to
such CircumstanceS, which, if known to them, would easily discover to them
the Witneffes. However the Advocates, bound to the Inquisition by Oath,
must form them, that they may seem to do something for the criminals,
when in Reality they do nothing, and deceive the miserable Prisoners‚ with the.
vain Hopes‚ what they will do in their Defence, when nothing at all is done
for them3 for whilst the VVitneffes or Informers are concealed from them,
they are deprived of‘the best and most neceffary Means of their Desence..
Howeve-r, this is stricff'tly prohibited by several Edicts of the Popes, and In—,'
strufflons of the Inquifitors. 3

Thus Innocent IV. expressly decreed in a Bull published An. 1253. ’Tis our
Pleasure that the Names both of the Accusers and theffi’s of heretical Pravity, shall
hy no Means be discovered, because of the Scandal or Danger that may follow upon such
Disco-very, and yet nevertheffess let the Depofitions of such Witneſjes be entirely credited.
The Council of Biterre hath decreed the same, Cap. 10. But beware of this,
according to the wile Pleafitre of the Apostolick See, that the Names of the Witneffis
be not discovered by any Sign or Word. F ormerly Boniface VIII. c. Statuta. §. Ju-
bemus, de haeret. l. 6. granted that the Names of the Witneffes and Accusers
might be discovered, when there was no Danger-. When there is no Danger in
the aforesaid Case, let the Names of the theſjes and Accusers he made known, ac-
cording as is usual in other Trials. But in all these Things we command both the Bishop
and Inquisitors to abt with a pure and cautious Intention, and not to suppreſs the
Names of the Accusers or theffes, hy pretending Danger where there is none 3 nor
on the other hand, to say there is no Danger, when in Reality there is. And let
them charge this upon their Consciences. And this was sometimes observed, asFol.131.
appears frorn the Sentences of the ‘Tholouse Inquifition, in the Sentence of Wil-
Ziam Cavalerius of Cordua, who having revoked the Confeffion that had been
drawn frorn him by Torture‚ is said to have been conviffited by WitneffeS.
And the Depositions against him being discovered to him, and read to him plainly, and
in his own Language, and the Names of the theffi’s depostng against him exprcff’d,
ὅτε. But now they think there is always Danger in this Discovery, and ihere-
fore they never publiffi the Names or Persons of the WitnesseS, because they
believe, aster such Discovery, they ‘shall never find any Persons willing to be-
come Informers against Hereticks. There is also extant an Apostolick Brief
of Pius IV. concerning th'is Affair, beginning, Cum ficut.

In Spain also 'tis commanded not to discover the Witnesses Names, by the
Sevillelnstruffion, An. 1484. c. 16. In like manner, because it appears, and is
certain, upon legal Information, that if the Names and Persons of the [th.ffi’s‚ who
depose in the said Crime of Heresy, he discovered, they may incurr great Damage
