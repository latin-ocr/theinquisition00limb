 

The Htsronr ofthe INQUISITION.

Ἰ · There is another Form of the Interdicl: extant in a Manuscriptof the Church

ofBeouvis amongst the Laws of Charles the Great. In the Nome of Christ, I
Hildegarit’js‚ Bishop of Beauvis, by the Authority of the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost, and by the Authority of St. Peter, Prince of the Apostles, and hy our
own Authority, do excommunicate and interdie} this Church‚ and all the Chapels he-
longingto it, that no one moy have Power from Almighty God‚ or from St. Peter,
the Prince of the Apostles, from this Day to stng or hear Maſs, or perform any divine
office, or receive the Tythe of Almighty God, without our special Leave. And who-
everfhallprefitme, contrary to these Interdicis, either to fing or hear Maſs, or to
perform divine Service in any Place‚ or to receive the Tythe of Almighty God, let
him be excommunicated and accurfed by the Authority of the omnipoteni God the Fa·
ther, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, andos St. Peter, and all the Saints, andsepa-
rated from the Society of Christians, and from the Doors of our holy Mother Church,
where there is Remiffion of Sins, and let him be Anathema Maranatha‚ to the End
of the Woer, with the Devils in Hell. So let it be, once, twice, thrice, Amen. Bo.

[Τὲυὲ Du Gange describes the InterdiCt. But the Venetian Divines, in their
T reatise concerning the Interdi& of Pope Paul V. An. 1606. Propos. 19. affirm
that the Interdift is a new Censure in the Church 3 and they thus prove it ’.τ
Because there is no mention of an Interdie‘t, either as to the Word or Meaning,
in the holy Scriptum, or any one of the antient Fathers, or in the Collection of

Ἴ Canons by Curcard or Gratian, who wrote about the Year 1 150. And 'there-

fore it did not begin till after his Time, because Alexander ΙΙΙ. first mentions
it in the Decretals, in a certain Letter of his to the English Prelates, An. 1 170.
