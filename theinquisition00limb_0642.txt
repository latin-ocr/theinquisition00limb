fit, that he may not be wholly deprived of the Means of his Defence. And
finally, he again and again admonishes the Inquifitors not rashly or eafily to
condemn any one to canonica} Purgati0n‚ for this Reason, amongst others,
that 'tis enough to fink the Criminal‚ if the Witnesses answer, that they don’t
know, or doubt, whether he swore true or false. And indeed who would
not be doubtful in this Case, who knows that no one is condemned to Pur-
gation who is not vehemently suspected. And therefore, in his Opinion they
only are to be injoined Purgation‚ whose Reputation is of high Concern to
the Christian People, viz. Bishops, Priests‚ Preachers‚ and others of the

same Kind.

 

C H A P. XXIX.

How the P R 0 c E s s is ended by Torture.

’ H E N the Person accused is not found guilty either by his own cona
seffion, or the Evidence of the F act, or legally producing the Wit-
nesseS, and when there is no such Evidence to support the Suspicion‚ as is ne-
cessary to his being condemned to abjure Heresy, he is condemned by an in-
terlocutory Sentence to the Qestion and Torture, that if he confeffes no·
thing when interrogated by Torture, he may be esteemed as free and inno—
(καὶαι. cent, and that if he confeffes his Errors he may be converted and live. For

Torments. And yet in the Critne of Herefy, Royas would have the Judges
peculiarly disposed‚ and ready to put Men to the Torture, because ’tis a.
Crime concealed in its Nature, and there is ostentimes great want of Proofa'

and is more concealed than other Crimes. Add to this, that an Heretick’s con.-
feffing, will be greatly profitable to himself and the whole Common-

wealth.

The Cases‚ in which they proceed to, the Torture in the Process of the In-
quifition, are various. This however is a received Thing, that they are ne-
