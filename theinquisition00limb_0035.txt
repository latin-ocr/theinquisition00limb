plunder’d the Temple, he caused an Aitar to be built in it, upon which he
,sacrificed Swine, which were an Abomination to the Jews, and forbidden b
their Laws. Not content with this, he compelssed them to forsake the Wor-

Altars and Temples to them in all the Towns and Streets, and offering Swine

The same Aunhor tells us aks0, in his Historyof the rssaccabees, that Antiochus
put forth an Ediet, whereby he made it Death for any to observ-e the Jewifh

'Ighe ten Persecutions, as they are reckoned‚ of the Christians by the
Roman Emperors, purely for their Religion, are standing Monuments of
their religious Zeal, or rather of their outragious Futy against all who would
not comply with the established Religion. Indeed, the very civil Constitution
of Rome was founded upon persecuting Principles. Tertullian tells us, iThbuApoiaeai
'twas an ancient Decree thatrno Emperarfhould consecrate a new God, unless he was
approved by the Senate ; and one of the standing Laws of the Republick was
