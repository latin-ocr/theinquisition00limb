‘⁶ lar Court, but they must be dealt with by Law till the pronouncing the
“ definitive Sentence. Neither are they to be rooted up ont of the¹ Catholick
“ Chmch, till they have been once and again, and“several‘times-admonissied
“ about the Salvation of their Souls, by learned, pious‚ and rel‘igious Men.”

Penitents are those, who, admonished by the Ecclesiastical Judge, abjure

P··'-· q.40. their Error, and give suitable Satissastion at the Pleasure of the Bishop and

Inquifitor. Osthese there are two Sorts t· Some come-of- their own accord, or
within the Time of Grace‚ without being cited, or calledby Name, or having
any particular Inquifition made after them 3 whereas others return after being
apprehended, cited, and inquislted, and oftentimes after many Admonitions.
The first are treated with greater Mildness, and are sometimes enjoin'd a se·
cret Penance, but must however abjure their- Errors, and be bound under the
Forfeiture ofall their Effersts to the Inquifition‚ to accomplish the Penance en-

joined them. These Things we have in the Council of Biterre, cap. 5. Toficch

who confess within the Time of Grace‚ voluntarily and fully, and declare they will
return to the-Ecclefiastical Unity, grant them the Benefit of Absttlution, according to
the Fornz of the Charch, viz. caustng them to abjure every Heresy that exalts it
sets against the holy Roman Charch, and the Orthodox Faith, under every Name
whatsofver, and to swear that they will also preserve and defend the Catholick Faith,
which· the said hely Roman Church holds and preaches, and that they will profi’cute to
their almost Hereticks of every Kind, convii-ted as well as condemned, their Be·
!ievers‚ Receivers, Defenders and Abettors, by secking after, accufing andseizing
them, or at least, hyfaithfully discovering them to the Inqztifitors, or other faithful
Perseus, ‘coho have better Inclination and Ability to apprehensi them: And that in·
whatsoever Respec? they are or shall be found to have offended in the same Crime, they·

Jhrzil (ibide by the Commands of the Inquifitors and Charch, and receive andfulfil the

Pcnance {cubicio at any time they shall enjointhem, and shall solemnly hind themselves
thus to receive and fulfil it, under Penalty of forfeiting all their Effefft's to the Inquisition
and C loia-ch.

In the same Council, towards the End, there is very stri& Command, con-
cerning the giving this pecuniary Caution. As tofitch who return ofthemselves,
without being accused by others, let the Inquifitor take diligent Care, that they give
,Money Security, after they have sworn to stand precisely by the Commands of the Church,n
ond to obser-ve and obey them. Afterwards leta private Penance be enjoined them at
the Plcafitre os the Inquifitor, and thus returning‚ let them be absolved and dispenset}
with. Clement IV. in his Bull, Licet ex omnibus, commands the Inquifitors tm
look to itvery carefully, that they be not deceived by a feigned Converfion.
But if any of the aforesaid Perfhns will wholly abjure their heretical Pravity, and re-
turn to the Ecclefiastical Unity, grant them the Benefit of Absolution according to the
Form of the Church, and enjoin them the usual Penance, being, particularly carefuk
that they do not fraudulently return by a feigned C onvetfion, and thas deceiving you, or
rather themselves„ wear the Wolf under the Appearance of the Lamb.

As to those who do not voluntarily return, the Penance enjoin’d them is
more severe,er they are accounted convist, and in some Measure forced. There-

ᾖε no particular Aceount to be given of their PenanceS, which are left tchthoe
