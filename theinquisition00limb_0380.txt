nitv, Authority, Honourableness, and other Qalities of the Witnesses. We
ud.1>ar, have a famous Instance how insolently the Inquifitors sometimes abuse this
ΜΕ· Power, in Jocm, Daug'nter of the Emperor Charles V. whom they cited be,-
·¹⁷²q¹‘²s fore their Tribunal, to interrogate her concerning a certain Person, in some
⁷33· 282· Matters relating to the Faith. The Emperor himself was so afraid of this
&zni'fflf' Power, that he commanded his Daughter not to put off the Affair, but make
her Deposition without delay, to avoid the Sentence of Excommunication, as
well against others as against himself, if she believed him culpable in the
smallest Matter. Upon which the most serene Joan gave in immediately her
Deposition before Fernand Valdez, Archbishop of Seville, at that Time Inqui«
fitor General. But if the Bishop or Inquifitor sends for Witneffes from any,
other Diocese‚ he is not obliged to send the Process to the Bishop of such
Diocese ·, nor can such Bishopjustly demand it. On the contrany‚ he 1301111--
ged and bound to send the Witneffes, after having read the Letters of the Bi—
shop who requires it, and says he hath Need of this or the other Witness,
to give his Testimony in the Cause of Faith. The neceffary Witness.
must therefore be sent, and Care taken, if it can be done, that he may not
know that he is called to bear Witness against any one in the Cause of Faith,
least he should discover the Affair, and so Obstru& itu, ,unlessz for other Rea«
sons it ought to be done upon full Knowledge of the Probity and Fidelity of
the XVitness.

In this Age the Spanifh Inquifition endeavoured, under 'a specious Pretence,
to extend its Jurisdifflon over the Subjecffts of other Kings. According to the
Conventions and Treaties between the Kings of England and Spain, the English‚³
who the Spaniards call Hereticks, were allow³d‚ upon the Account of Corn·
merce and Trade, to dwell in the Countries of the Catholicks, upon <this Con-
dition, That they should not be molested for any Matters relatingto Religion
and Faith, unless they gave publick Offence 3 in which Case they were to be

Apssrcr Insvpunissi’d in Proportion to the Scandal given, according to Law. Antonius de

· ‘³ 3¹·Sozrfcz, Counsellor of the Tribunal. of the supreme Inquifition in Portugal‚ en·

quires when the Inquifitors may proceed against thern, and gives many Limi-

tations concerning such Hereticks, as they call them,rwhereby. he, subjects
them entirely to the Power of the Inquifitors,

“ And first, he afferts, that the Condition that Hereticks shall not be in-

“ terrogated concerning the Faith, unless upon Account of Scandal, is of no -.

“ Validity, if it is only supported by the King’s Authority 3 but the Inqui»

“ sitors have full Power to proceed against them according to Law z Because

“ Lay Jurisdic‘tion doth not extend to Matters Ecclesiastical, and relating to

“ the Faith. And therefore, unless that Condition be confirmed by the Pope,

“< the Inquisitors may proceed against any Person,- as soon as ever it appears ».

“ that he is an Heretick, whether he discovers his Heresy in their Districst‚ ot

“ in any other·, because an Heretick sins every where, and therefore may

“ be taken and punish'd any where. In this Case, if such Heretickhath re-

“ v-ceived Instruftion, he may be compelled to keep the Faith ·, if he hath not

‘¹‘- been instrueted, he may be oblig'd to receive it 3 and if he refuses to accept„

2‘2 iq, he may be punish’d as an Heretick.. :f Buff.
