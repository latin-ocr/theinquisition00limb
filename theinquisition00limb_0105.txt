subscriptione, and Non-Conformity were Crimes never to be forgiven. A
particular Account of these Things may be seen in Mr. Neal'e excellent Hi-
story of the Puritans‚ who harh done Justjce to that Subject. -Ι shall only
add That the Court of High-Commiffion established in this Reign‚ by the
Instigation of Whitgift, Archbishop of Cante'rbury, by which the commim-
oners were impowered to enquire into all Misdemeanors‚ by all suc'h Ways
and Means as they could devise, and thought necessary, to examine Persons
upon Omh, and to punish those who refused the Oath by Fine or Imprison‚
ment, according to their Discretion, was an high Stretch os the Prerogative,
and had a very near Resemblance to the Courts of Inquifition‚ and the Cruel-
ties that were practised in it, and the exorbitant Fines that were levied by it
in the two following Reigns, made it the universal Abhorrence of the Na·
ti0n, so that it was diffolved by Parliament‚ with a Clause that no such Court
should be erected for the future.

King James Ι. who was bred up in the Kirk of scotland, which profeffedjamest.
the Faith and Discipline of those called Puritans in England3 and though he
bleffed God, For honouring him to be King over such a Kirk‚ the sinceres} Kirk in
the World‚ yet, upon his Acceffion to the English Throne, soon shewed his
Averfion to the Constitution of that Kirk 3 and to their Brethren, the Puritans
in England. - These were solicirous for a sarther Reformation in the Church‚
which the Bilhops opposed, instilling this Maxim into the King, No Bishop no wiffon,
King·‚ which, as ssale and false a Maxim as it is, hath been lately trumpt up,
and publickly recommended‚ in a Sermon on the goth ofJanuary. In the
Conference at Hampton Court his Majesty not only fided with the Biffiops, but
affured the Puritan Ministers, who were sent for to it, that he had not called the
Affembly together for any Innovations‚ for that he acknowledged the Government Ec·-
clefiastiml, as it then was, to have been approved by God himself 3 giving them to
understand, that if they did not conform, he would either hurry them out ofthe King- Heylin’s
dom, or else do worse. And these Reasonings of the King’s were so strong, that Life vs
Whitgifc‚ Archbishop of Canterbzcry, with an impious and sordid Flattery said, Laud,
He was verily persuaded that the King spoke by the Spirit of God. ’Twas no won- p. ⁵8⁹
de'r that the Biffiops, thus supported by an inspired King, should get an easy
Victory over the Puritans‚ which poffibly they would not have done, had his
Majesty been absent, and the Aids of his Inspiration whhdrawn, since the
Arcbbishop did not pretend that himselfor his Brethren had any share of it„
But having thus gotten the Victory, they strove by many Methods of Vio-b
lence to maintain it3 and used such Severities towards the Non-Conformists‚
that they were forced to seek Refuge in foreign Countries, The Truth is, this
Conference at Hampton Court was never intended to satisfy the Puritans‚ but
as a Blind to introduce Episcopacy into Scotland, and to subvert the Constitu-
tion and Establishment of that Church.

His Majesty, in one of his Speeches to his Parliament‚ tells them, that he
was never violent and unreasonable in his Profeffion of Religion. I believe all Man-
kind will now aequit him of any violent ancl unreasonable Attachment to the
Protestant Religion and Liberties. He added in the same Speech‚ it may be
