56 The HrsToRY of the INQUISITIONJ

fil. 123· And lastly, we read in2the Sentence of John Philae-22, a Presbyter, ‘shut the
valdenses preach ω their Beljevers fhmetime aster Supper, in the Niga, out ff the
Gospels and Epistles, in the vulgar Language.

Since therefore there is so great a Diversity in the Opinions and Customs of
the Albzgenſss and Valdenstffs, 'tis very evident that they were two distinet Sedis,
both of them abhorring the Communion ofthe Church of Rome ·, but in ma'-
ny Things differing from each other. This appears most plainly from these
Αξὶςς for all those that received Sentence, to Page 92. are Albigenses .· Ste-
phen Pomher is the first of the Valdcasbs, mentioned in the same Page. Page 96.
follows the Sentence against John Brajffe, the Valdenfian. After that, the Al-
bigenses and Valdenst’s are condemned promiscuously, but in such aManner‚ as
that at first View, one may know one from the other. The principal Persons of
the Albigenses‚ who received others, and are mentioned in the several Sentences,
are Petrus Auteriz‘, Jmnes, his Son ·, and W'llz'am, Peter’s Brother, Petrus Rai-
mzmdz' de Sanfio Papulo, Aimericas Barroai, Amelius de Per-lis, Andreas de Padris,
Oeta-vius, Petrus Samii de Gardzz, Bernardus Aadoyni de Monte Acuta, and a
great Number of others, mentioned p. 93, 101, 106, 123, 146. b. From
hence I conclude, that they were not only two distinet δεᾶε originally, but
that they were not united into one Church afterwards, at least, in the Year
1320. i. e. half an Age after their first Rise.

Pegna in Icannot however deny, that Ivoaelus, who lived about those Times, attri-
Direa. butes many Things to the Valdeases, which in these Aets are ascribed to the
Pur-2· Albigenses, viz. that they are divided into two Parties. ‘There are some, says
eom. ις’ Ivonetus‚ who are accozmted PeffeH: Thefie are properly called the poor Men of
Lyons. All are not taken in ander this Charaffler, but are first instruaed them-

selves, a long while, that they may know hezo to teach others. {These Perse& declara

that they have nothing of their own, neither Houses nor Poffcffons, nor certain Dwel-

lings, And z'f they had any le'ves before, they put them away. ‘T hey say they are

the trae Sacceffirs of the Apostles, aad are the Mzsters aad Confcffirs of others 3

go vifitiag about the Countries, aad confirming their Disciples ia their Error : Tbeste
Disciples bring thera all Things neceffizry. Into whatever Place they come, they give

Notice of their Arrival: ‘They are met hy great Nmnbers in some safe and secret

Place, to see and hear them. T hey send them the best of Meat and Drink. They ap-

pot-nt Colleaiom for Support ostheir Poor, their Masters and Students, who have no-

thinq of their own 3 or else to inveigle others, who are drawn over to their Party by

the Low of Money. Most of these Things are ascribed in these Aets, to the
Albigeaft'm so that they sometimes seem to have been confounded with one

nother.

a On the other hand, Pegna and Eymericus seem to have acknowledged a
Difference between them. F or Pegym, upon Eymericus's Directory of the In-
quisitors, Par. 2. Commeat. 38. calls the Sacramentof the AlbigenseS, Consola-
mentum, the Consolation ·, and adds, that their other Sacrament was the Bles-

sing ofssread. T his, says he, is a Soa-t of breaking Bread, which they daily usk

at Dinner and Supper .· 'T is pefformed asser this Manner. When the Puritans (so

the calls the Albigenses) are come to the T able, they all say the Lord’s Prayer3 Ξῖ
