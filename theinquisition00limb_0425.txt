r ’ IS very evident from what hath been already said, that the Method
of paying the Inquisltors their Salaries, is not every where the same,
but very different, according as the confiscated Effects are seized, either by

the secular Lords or the Inquifitors.

Formerly, in France, the Expences and neceffary Supports were given Du Cauge·
them out of the royal Treasury, by the Ballives*; who, in that Age, Γαίῃ ²³⁰5.
ceived the Rernrne ofrheir several Distriets, and had their Accounts auditedtnqumtio,
in the Chamber of Accounts‚ as appears from those Accounts themselves.

For some of them gave in an Account of the Expences of the F riars In-
quifitors at Ascenfion Term, Ann. 1248. There is also extant in the Royal
Chamber of Records, Register Book 36. Cap. 16. an Edi& of Philip the
Fair, by which they are commanded, not only to furniih the Inquifitors with
neceffary Provifions, but also to give thern Affistance and Counsel in the Ex-
-ecution of the Office committed to them. To the Seneschall of Tholouse, and
Carcaffone, greeting: Whereas Friar William de Morreriis, a Predz'cant, of
whom we have received a favourahle Amant, is, as is reported, newly deputed b‘y
the Apostolick Authority, Inquisttor at Tholouse‚ we command you, that ye
caufi’ to he given ancl ministred to him our Jayls, sttuate in our Lands, for the

Custody of Persons taken ap for the Crime of Heresy3 as also Money for his Pro·
vision, and for executing his Office ; and that you grant him all Helo, Favour and

Counsel therein, as hath been hitherto granted to other Inquzfitors, and as long as it
shall be our Pleasure. Dated at Vicenn. 1302.

James, King of Aragon, by a Law, beginning, Qtoniam fidei Catholicae, made
May 23, 1292. thus commands : Likewift alst> we Will and Command, that yt'Bzovius, ·

Matters, as they shall give in their Accounts of them, as often as you shall be re-

quired by them, or any one of them.
In Italy and other Places, where the Inquifitors are poor, the Common—Eymer.
