remember'd and known to Posterity hy Pastoral Let-
terS, Defences of Christianity, and Vindications of
Christ's MiracleS, than by that Rigidness and crnel
Zeal for Uniformity z'n Opinions, ond liseless Cere-
mom'es, hy which many ostheir Prede‘ccfſjors have left

maer,- nnd, by being Eramples of Christian Piotyg
Moderati0n‚ and Forhearance‚ influence the inferior
Clergy to imitate them.

escaped me in the IntrodnCZion or Transsatz'on‚ and to
ask my Squsc‘rz'hers Pardon for the long Delay of this
W ork. The ill State of my Healthfor many Months

will do any Good‚ I shall be ‚thnnkful to G0d‚ and not
repent my own Labonr,
