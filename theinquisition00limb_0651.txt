The Method of Torturing‚ and the Degree of Tortures now used in the
Spamfh Inquifiti0n‚ will be well understood from the History of Isaac Orobio, a
Jew, and DoCtor ofPhyfick, who was accused to the Inquifition as a Jew‚by a
certain Moor his Servant, who had by his Order before this been whipped for
thieving ·, and four Years after this he was again accused by a certain Enerny
of his sor another Fa& which would have proved him a Jew. But Orobio
obstinately denied that he was one. I will here give the Account ofhis Tor-
ture, asI had it from his own Mouth. After three whole Years which he
had been in Jayl, and several Examinations, and the Discovery of the Crimes
to him of which he was accused, in order to his Confeffion, and his constant
Denialofthem‚ he was at length carried out of his Jayl, and thro' several
Turnings brought to the Place of Torture. This was towards the Evening.
It was a large under-ground Room, arched, and the Walls covered with black
Hangings. The Candlesticks were fastned to the Wall, and the whole Roorn
enlightned with Candles placed in thern. At one End of it there was an in-
closed Place like a Closet, where the Inquifitor and Notary sat at a Table‚
so that the Place seemed to him as the very Manli-on of Death, every Thing

told the Truth‚ the Inquifitor gravely protested, that fince he was so obsti-
nate as to suffer the Torture, the holy Office would be innocent, ifhe should
ssied his Blood‚ or even expire in his Torments. When he had said this,
they put a Linen Garment over his Body, and drew it so very close on each
Side, as almost squeezed him to Death. When he was almost dying, they
ssackned at once the Sides of the Garment, and after he began to breathe
again, the sudden Alteration put him to the most grievous Anguish and
Pain. When he had overcomethis Torture, the same Admonition was re-
peated, that he would confess the Truth in order to prevent farther Torment.
And as he persisted in his Denial, they tied his Thumbs so very tite with small
Cords, as-made the Extremities ofthem greatly swell, and caused the Blood to
spurt out from under his Nails. After this he was placed with his Back against a
Wall, and fixed upon a little Bench. Into the Wall were fastned little Iron Pul-
lies, thro' which there were Ropes drawn, and tied round his Body in several
Places, and especially his Arms and LegS. The Executioner drawing these
Ropes with great Violence, sastned his Body with them to the Wall, so that
his Hands and Feet‚ and especially his Fingers and Toes being bound so
straitly with: them, put him tothe most. exquislte Pain, and seemed to⁴ him
just as tho' he had been diffolving in· Flames. In the Midstofthese Torments
the Torturer, of a sudden, drew: the Bench from under him, so. that the
miserable Wretch hung by the Cords without any Thing to support him,
and by the Weight of his Body drew the Knots yet much closer. After this a
new kind of Torture succeeded. There was an Instrument like asmall Ladtler,
made oftwo upright Pieces of ΧΝοοά, and five cross ones sharpned before. This
the Torturer placed over against him, and by a certain proper Motion struck it

with great Violence against both his Shingi'o that he received upon meli af
