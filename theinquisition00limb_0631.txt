“ The Judges must also be very careful‚ generally to interrogate the Cri· §. 22⁷<
“ vminals concerning their Accomplices‚ and of all others from whom they
“ have learnt Herefies‚ and who they know to be, or to have been Hereticks.
“ And if they discover any Thing of these Matters‚ it must be written down

“ For which Reasons this one Thing is to be confider'd and avoided, tho’§. 32:
“ many Inquifitors have often practised it, viz. the deferring and suspending
“ the Causes of many Persons which have been a long while concluded, that
‘⁴ they may punish several Criminals together. The Consequence of this is,
“ that such Criminals, who have fully confefl‘ed their Errors, are made un-
“ -righteoussy to suffer the Punishment of remaining in Jayl, and of pining
“ away thro’ Nastiness, InfeEtion andlong Confinement, and which is much
“ more grievous and dangerom, occasions them to retra& the Confeffions
“ they have rightly made, and never more to think of them, and sometimes
“ to despair and die. 'Tis therefore much more agreeable to Piety and Mer-

Whg„ the Opinions of the Counsellors are heard, a-nd the Sentence given,
the Criminal is summoned to come and hear his Sentence. 'Tis not de-
termined by any particular Law by what Officer he is to be cited, and there-
fore the Custom of each Inquifition is to be observed. Without such Citation
there can be no Sentence. This Pegna gives us a large Account of in his
