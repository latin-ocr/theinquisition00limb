was, {hat theiewhole C rime or Error confisted in this, that atstated Times they were uftd
to meet before Day-lighl, and to stng an Ilymn to Christ as God, and thal ‘they bound
themselves by an Oath not to commit any lVickedness, such as Thefts, Robbeiies, Adul-
teries, and the like. And to be affured of the Truth of this, he put two Maids
to the Torture‚ and after examining them, found them guilty of nothing but:
α wicked and unreasonnble Superstition. This is the noblest Vindication of the Ριιὲ
rity and Innocency of the Christan Aflemblies, and abundantly justifies the Aca
RH. L.3.count of Eusebius from Hegestppus, u Thai the Clam-ch continued until these Times as
'³ a Virginpure and uncorrupted3 and proves beyond all Contradifflon, that the
Persecution raised against them was purely on a religious Account, and not
for any Iinmoralitics and Crimes against the Lam, that could be proved against
the Christians‚ though their Enemies ssandered them with the vilest, and hereby
'AdScapul endeavoured to render thern hateful to the whole World. Woy, says Tertullian,
[ioth a Christian suffer, but for being of their Nuinher ? Hath any one proved Incest,.
ον Cruelty upon us, during this long space of Time ,Ρ No 3 'tis for our Innocence, Pro·
buy, Justice‚ Chastity‚ Fnith, Veracity0 and for the living God that we are burne
alive. Pliny was forced to aequit thern from every Thing but an unreafhnable
Superstiti0n‚ i. e. their resolute Adherence to the Faith of Christ. And yet:
though Innocent in all other respects, when they were brought before his Tri=w
bunal he treated thern in this unrighteous Manner: He only asked them, Whe-
ther they were Christians? If they confefl‘ed it, he asked thern the same Qe-
stion again and again, adding Threatnings to his Qiestions. Is theytperse-
vered in their Confeffion he condemned them to Death, because whatever--
their Confeffion might be, he was very sure, that their Slubbornness and inflexible
Obstinacy dcstrved Punishment. So that without being convicted of any Crime‚
but that of Constancy in their Religion, this equitable Heathen, this rational
Philosopher, this righteous Judge‚ condemns them to a cruel Death. And
for this Condust the Emperor, his Master, commends him. For in answer to
Pliny’s Qestion, Whether he should go on to punish the Name it sels, though
chargeable with no CrimeS, or the Crimes only which attended the Name?
Trajan in his Rescript, after commending Pliny, orders, T hat if they were
accused and convisted of being Christians they should be put to Death‚ unless
they renounced that Name, and sacrificed to his Gods. {I'ertullian and Athena-
goras, in their Apologies, very justly inveigh with great Warmth against this
imperial Rescript3 and indeed, a more sssameful Piece of Iniquity was never
praetised in the darkest Times of Popery. I hope also my Reader will ob-
serve, that this was Lay-Persecution, and owed its Rise to the religious Zeal
of one of the best of the Roman Emperors, and not only to the Contrivances of
cruel and defigning Priests ; that it was justified and carried on by a very fa-
mous and learned Philosopher‚ whose Reason taught him, that what he ac-
counted Superstition, if incurable, was to be punished with Death3 and that
it was managed with great Fury and Barbarity, Multitudes of Persons in the
several Provinces being destroyed merely on account of the Christian Name,
by various and exquisite Methods of Cruelty.
