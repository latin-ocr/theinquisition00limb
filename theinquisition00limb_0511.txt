 

The H1s101w ofthe INQUISITION. 81⁷

In Spain these soliciting Confeffors are only lightly Γῃῖρρξὶρά, because th& 15!
ζ vseaniards confidet it rather as proceeding fron] Lust than an Intention to

’ abuse the Sacrament of Penance. But in Italy they are vehemently suspeffted3

i and therefore whereas in Spain they abjure only as lightly suspected, in Italy
they abjure as vehemently. So Carena gives an Instance of a certain Con-72, 75·
. seffor in one of the Cities belonging to the Territories of Cremona, who abju-

red as lighty suspected ¹for this Crime of Soliciting‚ but was forced to abjure

, again as vehemently suspected at Cremona, by Order of the supream Tribunal

of the Cit oi Rome.

Belides ysalutary Penances, such as Fastings, Prayers‚ and the like, such ς. 18r
Confeffors are usually condemned to the Gallies for five or seven YearS‚ to
perpetual Imprisonment 3 yesi, sometimes at the Pleasure only of t'ne Cardi-
nals supream Inquifitors, they rnay be delivered over to the secular Arm, as
the Constitution of Gregory XV. plainly directs. They are also to be suspended
for ever from hearing Confeffions, to be deprived of their Benefices, Digni-
ties, afflve and paffive Vote‚ at the Pleasure of the InquifitorS. Such Con„
feffors ³³³ ase Regulam may also be enjoined to bein the last and lowest Place
amongst the Regulars of their Monasteries. Sometimes the Inquisitors must
command, that the Sentence against a Regular Confeffor ihall be read pub-

κ lickly in the next general Chapter of their Religion, as a Terror and Exam-

Ple[})e3th{>rdietimes, according to the Heinousness of the Offence‚ a more
grievous Puniihment is inflicted. JohnStock, Notary of the Apostolick Rota,

¹ -relates, in a Letter written at Rome, Onober. 8, 1564. to J. Hensberg‚ a Di-
’ vine of Cologn‚ a *remarkable {nstance of this. These eretches of aurs are not

fi> holy as they appear. ‘They walk in the Likeness of Sheep, but within are
·ravenz'ng Wolves, and their pretended Sanc‘tity is a double Iniqstity. They are under
the Influence of a strong Ambition. The Venetians ordered one of them to be burnt
alive, by Command of the Pope. He had been Father Confeſjbr to some Num in the
Dominions of Venice, and had gat twelve of them with Chaa, amongst whom the
Abbess and two others had children in one Year. As. he was confeffing them, he

ln Portugal also the Crime of Sodomy belongs to the Tribunal of the In· Soura,
quifition, »by the Decree of Gregory XIII. Aug. 13. An. 1574. by which 'tisAph0s0
granted to the Inquifitor of Portugal, to proceed in the Crime of Sodomy‚{'¹7¹“s'
as in t'ne Crime of Heresy, observing the same Manner and Form. By& ἓξ {gv
the Laws ofthe Kingdom of Portugal, Sodomites are punished with Death, ³
and Confiscamon of all their Effefts, and their Children and Grandchildren
become infamous. After the natural Death of a Sodomite, >if the Cri1ne§, 31· ;
