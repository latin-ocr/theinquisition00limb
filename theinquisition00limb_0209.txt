‘The PERsncurmNs qfthe Popns agaiffi HERETicKs,

N the following Ages the Affairs of the Church were so manag’d under
the Government of the PopeS, and all Persons so strictly curbed by the
Severity of the Laws, that they durst not even so much as whisper against
the received Opinions of the Church, Besldes this, so deep was the Igno-
rance that had spread it self over the World, that Men, without the least
Regard to Knowledge and Learning, received with a blind Obedience every
Thing that the Ecclefiasticks order’d them, however stupid and superstitious,
without any Examination ; and if any one dared in the least to contradict
them, he was sure immediately to be punish’d3 whereby the most absurd
Opinions came to be establilh’d by the Violence of the Popes. 'Twas at
this Time that the Doctrine of Transubstantiation was introduced into the
Church, now, in every Thing, subject to the Pope’s Beck 3 and how dan-

the Supper, was only the Figure of the Body and Blood of the Lord, was
oondemn'd as an Heretick, by Leo IX. in a Synod at Rome and Vercellae, in
the Year 1050, and five Years after, viz. 1055. was forced to recant, and to
subscribe with his own Hand to the F aith of the Roman Church, and confirm it
with an Oath‚ by Vmor ΙΙ. in the Council of Tours. But as Berengarius his
Recantation was forced ; and as he afterwards defended that Opinion, which
in his Heart he believed, Nicolaus ΙΙ. called a Council at the Laterum Anno
1059. and there again condemn’d Berengarius, and compell'd him to make a
solemn Abjuration‚ which Berengarius publickly read, and fign'd with his own
Hand. This was that famous Abjuration‚ which begins, Ego Berengarius.
Thus was the Truth suppreffed by the Papal Violence. In the East also, Anno
1118. one Bafilz‘us, the Author of the Se& of the Bongomili, was publickly
burnt for Heresy by the Command of Alexim Comnenus the Emperor, as
Baronius relate5‚ Anno 1 1 18. §. ²7·

In the mean Time the Power of the Roman Pontiff grew to a prodigious
Height, and began to be very troublesome, even to the Emperors them·
selves ·‚ for not content with the Ecclefiastical Power, they claimed also the
Subiection of the Secular. But in the rnidst of this thick Darkness, some Glim*
merings of Light broke forth through the great Mercy of God.

For after the Year of Christ, 1 100. there arose various Disputes between the
Emperors and Popes, about the Papal Power in secular Affairs, which, as they

Some of the Emperors bravely maintained their Rights against the Papal En-
