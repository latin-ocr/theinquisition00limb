the Bishops. But if there is an Abjuration to be made, the Consent of bothffafssjh
is neceffary, according to the Rescript of Innocent IV. beginning, Tunc potzffime. 4. ᾗ. τις
But if any shall wholly ahjure heretical Pravity, ana' will return to the Ecclcfi-
astical Unity, let ‘the Diocestzn he confidunt, and grant them the Benefit of Ahy'olation,
according to the Form of the Church, and enjoin them the usitat Penance. But if such
Abjuration or Purgation be made before one of them only, it is to be account-
ed valid. From hence they draw this Inference 3 That if any one {hall have
abjured, as an Heretick, or vehemently suspected, before either one of the a-
foresaid, and shall afterward be found to have fallen into Heresy‚ he may be
delivered over to the secular Court as a Relapse 3 and that he cannot defend
himselfby urging the Nullity or Invalidity of the Abjuration‚ as having been
made only before one ofthem. v
. The Bishop and Inquifitor may constitute each other their Vicegerents‚ in Q, 49„
those Cases in which neither can a& separately. But zf the Bishop, or the Per· com. 92·

of them; the Bishop, or his Delegate, or the Delegate of the Chapter, during the
Vacancy of the See, may appoint the Inquisttor in his Room, and the Inquisitor or
his Delegate may thus appoint the Bishop, or fignify their Advice and Confhnt by Let-
ters. If they will not rneet together, the one must require the other; nor can
either of them proceed till eight Days after they have thus mutually de-
manded each others Attendance.

The Bishop and the ''Inquisitor may proceed by a delegated Authority‚ and Qu. 5.
then they are equal. When the Bishop proceeds by his ordinary Authority,
and the Inquifitor by a delegated one, the Inquifitor is the greater. If the Simanc.
Bishop and Inquifitor cite the same Person before thern, to answer concerning 12'2· 44·
the Faith‚ he must, when cited, appear before both, if the Times of the §· 13·
Citation are different: if they are the same, he must appear before the In-
quisitor. For the Inquifitors are specially delegated for' the Affairs of the
Faith. But in this Case they may oblige each other. But in Spain the Inqui-Direff.
fitors are always preferred in these Causes, and the Bishop cannot hinder the p. 3. qu-
Process of the Inquifitor. 50·

When the Bishop and Inquisitor differ, they can’t proceed to a definitive
Sentence‚ but must refer the whole Cause drawn up to the pope, or to the
suprearn Tribunal of the Inquisition. In Spain this must be done even when
they differ in ‘Cases of no great Importance. This is prescribed by the Μι-
drid ·1nstru6ti0n‚ An. 1561. cap. 66. In all Cases where therefhall happen a Dis· cm, 99=

agree, although the Learned in the Law and the Counsellors differ, even though they
