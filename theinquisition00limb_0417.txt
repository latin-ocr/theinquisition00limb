This Command they will have observed as most sacred, because, as they
say, Secrecy is the Strength of the Inquifition, which might easily be viola·
ted, unless this Order be punftually kept, and therefore they always most se-
verely punish those who transgress it. Gonsalvz‘us Montanus gives us a very re· p, 108.

“ Humanity, and not very old, was appointed Keeper of the Tower of Thana,
“ which is the Prison of the Inquifition. It happened, as it often doth in such
“ numerous and promiscuous ImprisonmentS, that amongst other Prisoners
“ committed to his Custody, there was a certain good Mat-ron, with her two
“ Daughters, who were put in different Cells, and earnestly desired the Li-
“ berty of seeing one another, and comforting each other in so great a Cala-
“ mity. They therefore earnestly entreated the Keeper, that he would suffer
“ them to be together for one quarter of an Hour, that they might have the
“ Satisfatstion of embracing each other. He being moved with Humanity
“ and Compaflion, allowed them to be together, and talk with one another
“ for half an Hour, and after they had indulged their mutual Affections, he
“ put them, as they were before, in their separate Prisons. A few Days af-
“ ter this they were put with great Cruelty to the Torture 3 and the Keeper
“ being afraid, that through the Severity of their Torments, they should
“ discover to the Lords the F athers Inquifitors, his small Humanity in suffer-
“ ing them to converse together for half an Hour without the Inquifitors
“ Leave, thro’ Terror, went himself to the holy Tribunal, of his own Ac·
“ cord confeffed his Sin, and prayed for Pardou, foolishly believing, that
“ by such his Confeffion, he should prevent the Punishment that threatned

“ aCrime, that they ordered him immediately to be thrown into jay'l, and
“ such was the Cruelty of his Treatment, and the Disorder of Mind that fol·
“ lowed on it, that he soon grew distrafted. However‚ his Disorder and
“ Madness did not save him from a more grievous Punishment. For after he
v“ had lain a full Year in that cursed Prison, they brought him out in the pub-

“ lick Proceffion, cloathed with the yellow Garment, and an Halter round
“ his Neck, as though he had been a common Thief, and condemned him

“ first to receive two hundred Laffles through the Streets of the City, and
‘⁸ then to the Gallies for fix Years. The Day after the Proceffion, as he
‘¹‘ was carried from the Triana to be whipt with the usual Solemnity, his Mad·
“ ness, which usually seized him every other Hour, came on him, and throw-
“ ing himself from the Ass on which, for the greater Shame, he was carried,
“ he ssew upon the Inquisitory * Alguazile, and snatching from him a Sword,
“ had certainly killed him, had he not been prevented by the Mob who at-
“ tended him, and sethim again upon the Ass, and guarded him till he had
“ received the two hundred Lashes according to his Sentence. After this
