Of the NoTAR1Es oftheINQusm-ION.

HE Office of the Registers, whom they also call Notaries and Secreta· Simanc‘
ries, is to write down the Injunftions, Accusations, and all the Plead-tit. 41:
ings of the Causes. The Judge ought not only to take Care that the Notary § 7.
writes down the Depofitions of the WitneffeS, or the Answers of the Crimi-,Campeg-
naIS, but also that he diligently explains, and particularly remarks, during ²⁷² lauch„
the Process, the several Circumstances relating to the Witness, the Infor-c‘9‘
mer, and the Person against whom Inquifition is made, viz. Whether the Co—
lour of his Face changes ; whether he trembles or hefitates in speaking ; whe-
ther he frequently endeavours to interrupt the Interrogatories, by hauking or
spitting·, or whether his Voice trembles, and the like. All these Circum<-
stances the Judge ought to take Care to have particularly specified in the
Process, that it may not be said, that the Person inquired against is put to
the Torture without Proofs.

Whatsoever the Notary writes down from the Mouth of the Criminals, or chnae÷
Witnesses, must be in the same Language in which the Witness or C1·imina1prax.1nq;
speaks, without altering, adding, dirninilhing, transposing or inverting anyl 2· 0-20·
of the WordS. If the Criminal or Witness doth not understand Latiam ancy· ²²³3&
