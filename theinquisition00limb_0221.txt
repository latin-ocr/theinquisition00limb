of forsaking the Church of Rome, is the immoderate Love of Women:
Whereas, if they were not acted by the PrInciples of a good Conscience,
but from a Defire of gratifying their lustful Inclination, they might
with much more Safety abide in the Communion of the Charch οῗῖἒιηηρ,
where they have daily Occasions offered to them of fulfilling the
of the Flesh: They have nothing to sear, even from the bloody Tribulis. f,
of the Inquisition‚ if they are but cautious, tho’ they sollicit Woinen in tue
very Sacrament of Confeffion. This sor once to refute the Calumnies of the
Papists‚ who, whenever they are giving an Account of he Rise of any of
those they. call Hereticks, areperpetually repeating this Charge against them.
But to return to our Purpose :
Belides the above-mentioned Differences of Dostrines between the Albigenses
and Valdense5‚ they differed also in their Rites and Customs. For at first there
were two Sorts of the Albigenses. Some profeffed their Faith, and used theirfol. 40. a.
Customs, and were called Perfettz‘ seu Consolati, Perfet‘t or Comforted. Others
only enter'd into a Covenant with these perfeet- ones, which they call Lo Con-
venensa, The Agreement, that at the End ofLife they would be received intosol. 15· ὁ.
their Se& This Reception is often called Heretz'cation, and was performed 0‘2.a.70.a.‘·
after this manner to Beneditlus Molinerii in a certain Illness that he labouredv
under : Bernard de Goch, one of the Albigenses‚ held the Hands efthefick Per-fot. ιω. ἐι-
son between his own, and held a certain Book over him, in which he reocl the Ge·-
spel of St. John, In the Beginning was the Word‚ and delivered to him a fine
Threctd, with which he wasto be tiedfor Heresy. The Rites administer’d to a sick
Wornan were somewhat different ε· Petrus Auterii said in the Presence of thejfbl. 8602,
fick Wonmn, Praz‘fh God3 either instrutting the Womcm to scay so, ον sayittg so by*
himself. T hen he laid his Hand upon the VVomcm, holding a certain Book, andp. 43· W
reading fhme Wrds, but first put a white Linen Cloth upon her, and after he had
read z'n the Book, Peter and Aurelius mode many Bows near her Becl. For this·
Reception they were prepared by certain Abstinences, which I gather from -
the Sentence of Peter Raymundus Dominicus de Bornos who is said to have seen
Peter Auterii with Peter Sancti, who then. kept those Fasts‚ which they are
obliged to do, who are to be admitted to the Se& of the Hereticks.·
This Admiffion was believed to save the Soul of the Person admitted, and
was called S pirituczl Baptism, T he Consolation, The Reception, and Goocl Emi. Sofflot. 862 m*
that they. were believed to be so sanetified by it, asthat afterwards it wasfcl. ς. α.-
unlawful for them to be touched by a VVoman. Thus we read in the Sen-
tence of a Woman, whose Father had been received amongst the Alhigenses 3s01. 49.
§Chat she was forbid hy her Father to touch him, because oster his Reception no
Womem ought to touch him, czs'zd from thot Time she never did touch him..- Am?
in another Woman's Sentence3 Thot ἠοω zmlattfizl for her to touch Pet1·usfi2t.68‚?‚
Sancii, [md that she heard that 'twa-s reported amongti‘ them that they neither
touch a l‘Vometz, . nor suffer themselves to be touched by otte,
But inasmuch as it was posfible that the Person received might return to his
former PollutionS, his Reception was delay'd to his last Sickness, when there
was no more Hopes of Recovery, that so he might not lose the C-ood³ ht}
