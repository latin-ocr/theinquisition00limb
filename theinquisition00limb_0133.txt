have brokefi the Christian world into Parties, have been generally inremed,
and broached, and propagated by the Clergy ,- witness Arius‚ Mtvzcedo'nius, Nisk—
rius, Eutyches, Dioscorus, and others3 and thereforeif we may judge by zinv
Observations made on the Rise of Heresy, what is a proper Method to'pute
Stop to the Progress of it, it cannot be the Clergy’s forming Articles of
Faith, and forcing others to subscribe them; because this is the very Metnod
by which they have established and propagateo' it-

· The Truth is, this Method of pretenting Error will snit all Religions,
and all Soets of Principles whatsoever‚ end is that by which Error main-
tains its Ground, and is indeed render'd impregnable. All the differenr-
'Sorts of Christians, Paptsts and Protestmm Greeks, Lutherans, Calvimsts and Ar-
minium, cannot certainly be right in their discriminating Principles. And yet
where shall we find any Clergy that don't pretend a Righc to impose Subscripo

tions, and who do not maintain theTruth osthe A rticles to which they make such

Subscription neceffary? Upon this Foot the Dofirines of the Council of Trem,

the thirty nine Articles of the Church ofEnglaend‚and the Ass‘emblies Confeffion

of Fasth, are all of them equally true, Christian and Sacred5 for they are in dif-
ferent Places embraced as Standards ofOrthodoxy‚ aod their Sacredness and

Authority secur'd and maintain'd by the Subscriptions of the Clergy to themr

And therefore, Ι think it as little agreeable to Prudence as it is to justice for

Christians to keep up a Praetice that may be so easily, and hath been so of-

ten turned into a Security for Heresy, Superstition and Idolatry‚· and espe-

cially for Protestants to ware any longer these Mari-:s of Slat’ery‚ which their

Enemie3‚ whenever they have Power‚ will not fail to make Use of, either to

setter their Consciences‚ or distinguissn them for the Burning.

But it may be said that the Abuse of Subscriptions is no Argument against
the Use of them3 and that, es they are proper to discover what Mens Senti-
ments are, they may be so far sometimes a Guard and Security to the Truth.
But as all parties, who use thern² will urge this Reeson for them, that they
are in Posseffion of the Truth, and therefore willing to do all they can to se-
cure and promote it3 of Consequence Subscriptions to Articles of Faith can
never be looked on properly as Guards to real Truth, but as Guards to cer-
tain prevailing Principles, whether true or false· And even in this Case they
are wholly Ineffefiual. The Clergy of the Church of Engltmd are bound to
subscribe the thirty nine Anides, i. e. to the Truth of Athanafian and Calvi-
nistick Principles· But hath this Subscription answer'd its End? Do not the
Clergy, who are all Subscribers, and who often repeat their Subscriptions,
differ about these Heads as much as if they had never subscribed at all? Men
that have no Principles of Religion and Virtue‚ but enter the Church only
with a View to the Benefices and Preferments of it, will subscribe ten thou-
sand Times over, and to any Articles that can be given them, whether true
or false· Thus the Afiatick Bishops subscribed to the Condemnation of the
Decrees of the Couucil of Chalcedon, and inform Basiliscm the Emperor that
their Subscriptions were voluntary. And yet when Basiliscus was deposed,
they immediately subscribed to the Truth of those Decrees, and swore tlkeiiti
