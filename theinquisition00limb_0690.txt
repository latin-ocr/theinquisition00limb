260 The H18To-RY ofthe INQUISIT10N‚

'“ the Publication of the Evidence, six hundred Perjuries, and several Months,
“ yet inasrnuch as being in Prison he confeffes of his own Mind and Will his
“ Errors, without being compelled by Violence, he is adjudged to confess
“ voluntarily. Farther, they think that he also consesses voluntarily,
§- 45³ 4⁶'“ whose Confeffion is violently, ἵζε. by Torture drawn from him. For al.
“ tho’ the first Confeffion is drawn from him by Torment, yet is it not suffi-
‘· rient [ο the Proof or Condemnation, unless he afterwards confirms it by
“ a voltmtary Confeffion. And therefore when the Criminal ratifies of his
‘⁶ own Accord the extorted Confeffion, -they say he is not to be looked upon
“ as adino herein unwillingly, nor his Confirmation as extorted by Force,
‘⁶ but thatv'tis altogether voluntary, and that therefore if the Confeffion be
‘⁶ just that such a one is to be admitted : And 'tis then accounted just, when
‘⁶ ‘the Penitent testifies it with Tears, Groans, and Humility.
“ ’Tis also farther inquired, whether a Person is to be received to the Bosom
“ ofthe Church after the definitive Sentence, even till he is delivered to the se-
“ cular Court. Here the Laws determine that Penitents may be admitted
“ till the definitive Sentence‚ but that afterwards there is no Place for Pardon
“ and Mercy. ⁶
The Opinion of Royas is different, who thus proposes and resolves it.
{wiern 15.“ ’Tis no small Controversy amongst the Professors of the Law, until what
‘⁶ Term and Time converted Hereticks are to be received. Some say, if
“ they immediately and voluntarily return after the Discovery of their Er-
ι). 192, “ ror. Others, that Hereticks may return to the Faith after Sentence, and
‘⁶ are then to be admitted, and may escape the Punilhment os being turned
“ over to the secular Court. Others, that they may be received only till the
“ pronouncing of the Sentence. Concerning which Matter the saville In*-
“ struffion treats, c. 12. and that of Madrid, An. 1561. c. 4. Butifnegative
“ Hereticks are converted in a publick A& of the Faith, their Converfion
“ is presumed to be seigned and counterfeit, and that they are converted ra-
“ ther thro’ F ear of Death‚ than a Zeal for the Catholick F aith. For this
“ Reason such a kind of Converston is very seldom or never to be admitted,
‘·‘ unless very urgent Causes arise‚ viz. if any one should confess his Errors
“ with many Tears and Signs, and not only those of which he is accused,
“ but others alst), and farther discover his Accomplices, especially 1? they.
‘² are Persons related to him, and beloved by him. By these and other Cir-
“ curnstances, which depend wholly on the Pleasure ofthe Inqulfitors, it may.
