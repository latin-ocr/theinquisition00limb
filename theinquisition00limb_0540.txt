The H‘m-onv ofthe moun-anon.

I'riest when the .Mass is ended. Or they must do this always, or‘at
some certain Time, when it happens that the Inquifitor makesa genera-l Ser·
mon for the Faith. Other milder Punishments may be also thought oss for
Instance, some larges Almsgiving, the building some holy Place, and the
like. But ifthey persist longer in their Contumacy‚ there is somewhat ad-
ded by way of Penance‚ which direffly turns to the Honour of the Christian

fagiel}ng these Tinnsac‘tions, whether the Oath be taken or not, the In-

quilitor may and must appoint in every Bishoprick one Commiffary of forty
Years old, a religious or secular Clergyman, a wife and prudent Person, fa·
mous for Knowledge and good Manners, and zealous for the holy Faiffl, with
a Power of receiving Denunciations and Informations or Accusations from or
against any Persons whatsoever‚ and of proceeding, and doing other Things,
which the Inquifitor himself, if present, could do.

H E Commiffaries thus appointed or not, the Inquifitor appoints a ge-
T neral Sermon, according to the Prescript of the Council of Biterre.
Cap. 1. And then calling together the Clergy and People, and propounding
to them the Word of God, declare the Command that is given you, and the
Caztse of your coming, reading the Lenem, by Authority of which you are
te proceed, even as you know you ought to do. And that there may be no
Hindrance to the Offices of the Church, he must not appoint this Ser-
mon on a solemn Festival, buton the common Sunday, excepting Lem,
or the Advent3 and must take Care that the Rectors of the Churches
have these Lerrers of 1ῶίιέἶὶοη on Sundczy, that the Sunday after they may ap-
peunt the genem} Sermon to be the Sunday following. And that the So-
lemnfty of that Dar may be the greater, all other Sermons on it must be
suspended ; and. it must be notified to all the Heads of Religious Houses, and
Indulgeneies of *orry Days proirnsed to all who come to the Sermon. When
the Sim-my before that, on which the general Sermon is to be made, corneS,
the Inqnifitor must admonilh the Heads of Religious Houses, that two or
four of each Religion be present at the said Sermon.

On the Szziiday appointed, the Inquifitor makes the general Sermon to the
People, in which he speaks concerning the Faith, commends it, and exhorts
the Peop‘fie to the Defence of it, and the Extirpation of heretical Pravity.
When the Sermon is ended, he admonishes the People, that ’tis their Duty
to discover it to the lnquifitor, if they have known any Person that bath
spoken or done any thing against the Faith‚ or who holds any Error. Af-
