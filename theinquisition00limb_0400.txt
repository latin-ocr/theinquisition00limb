What the ΙΝ Qu 1 s 1 T 0 R s can ‘do themselves, and what in Conjantticm
with the ORDINAR 1 Es,

Ecause the, Judgrnent of Heres y is, as we have seen, committed *to the
Ordinaries or Bilhops, and to the Delegates or Inquisitors, 'tis proper to
consider what each can separately do. and what are those Acts in which both
must neceflarily concur, in order to their being effectual and valid.
Eymer. The Inquifitor without the Bissmp, and the Bithop without the Inquisitor,
Ρ· 3· ί1-47- may cite and arrest, or appre-hend and -deliver any one to safe Custody‚ and
put them in Irons‚ -if they think proper, and make Inquifition ¹against such ·as
are accuse'd. ÷But >neither without the other can deliver any Persons to hard or
close Imprisontnent‚ which. hath more· of the‘Nature of Punilhment than of
·Cust0dy„or put them to the -Tort›ure‚-‘0r force them in Irons by Hunger to
discover the Truth, which is one sort of very grievous Torment, orproeeed
Cap. Mul· to Sentence against thern. This appears from the Clementines. Therefore to pro-
torum. de *mote the Glory of God, and sor the Encrease of the same Fatua, and that the Affaz‘r of
haeret. the Inquisition may go on more prosperoufly‚ and that the searching out of heretical Pra-
.vity may proceed more solemnly‚ diligently, and cautioussy, we decree that it shall be
,, carried on as well by the Diocesan Bishops‚ as by the Inquifitors deputed· by the Aposto-
'lick See, vlaying astde all carnal Love, Hatred and Fear, and every Regard to tem-
poral Interest. So that every one of the aforenamed may without the other cite, ar·
rest or take up, or commit to safe Custody, and alst) put Criminals into Irons, if they
shall think proper. And this we lay upon their Consciences, {They may also make In-
quisttion against them, as they shall think itin this Case most agreeable to God and
⁷ Justice. But neither the Bishop without the lnquisztor, nor the Inquisitor without the
Diocesan Blst⁷0l⁷s or his Official, or during the Vacancy of the Epifiopal See, sttch Per-
son as shall be deputed by the Chapter, if they can each of them respet‘tively obtain a
Copv, within eight Days after they have given Notice to each other, fhall be able to
com'mit anv one to hard and close Imprzssmment, which looks more like Punishment than
Custody, or put them to the Torture, or proceed to Sentence against them. And if any
one shall presume to do otherwist’, it shall be ipso jure, null and void. In like man-
ner the Inquifitor without the B'ishop cannot deprive, nor declare to be depri-
ved of their Benefices and'Ecclesiastical Dignities heretica} Clergymen, unless
it shall legally appear that the Diocesans have conferred such Benefices know-
ingly upon such Persons3 for we declare that their Const’nt in such Cases fhall not
vt’egna.= be required, hut rather that they fhould be punzshed by their Judge. Decret. 6. de

mqmfim· a very plain and clear Case, by the Rescriptof Pius V. beginning, Cum ex A.

postolatus, that the· ssenefices of the heretical Clergy‚ are vacant from the
Day of their cornm1tt1ng the1r Crrme, and reserved to the Disposal of the A·
postolick See. From whence it appears that the Inquifitor may declare them
-deprived of them. ’Τίς
