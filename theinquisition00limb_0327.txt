’ F aith, by such a Mixture of various Nations and Religions, after having con-

sulted Pope Pius V. deputed one of the Inquifitors of Spain, fixed on by the In-
quifitor General, to discharge the Office of Inquifitor; giving him Pawer
to preside in all Tribunals, and to celebrate Acts of Faith‚ in all Places and
Cities they sailed to. This Ereetion of the Inquifition by Sea, Pius V. con-
firmed by a Bull sent to the General Inquifitor of Spain, beginning, Our late
most dear Son in Christ. Jerome Maurique exercised the Jurisssiietion granted
him, and held a publick A& of F aith in the City of Melina, in which many
underwent divers PunishmentS.

He also established it beyond Europe, not only in the Canary Issands, but
in the new World of America3 constituting two Tribunals of it, one in the
City of Lima, in the Province of Peru 3 the other in the Province and City of
Mexice. The Inquisition at Mexico was erected in the Year 1571. and in acap.2.1;

Year 1574. the third after its Erecffion, the first A& of Faith was celebrated
with a new and admirable Pomp, in the Marquiffes Market Place, where they
built a large Theatre, which covered almost the whole Area of the Market:
Place, and was close to the great Church, where were present, the Viceroy,
the Senate, the Chapter, and the Religious. The Viceroy, the Senate, and
a vast Number of other3‚ went with a large Guard, in solemn Proceffion,
to the Market Place, where were about eighty Penitents; and the A& last·
ed from six in the Morning to five in the Evening. Two Hereticks, one
an Englishman, the other a Frenchman, were released. Some for Judaifing,
some for Polygamy, and others for Sorceries, were reconciled. The Solem·
nity of this A& was such, that they who had seen that stately one at Val-
ladolid, held in the Year 1559. declared, That this was nothing inferior to it
in Majesty‚ excepting only that they wanted those royal Personages here,
which were present there. From this Time they celebrated yearly solemn
Acts of the F aith, where they brought Portuguese Jews, Persons guilty of
incestuous and wicked Marriage3‚ and many convieted of Sorcery and Witch-

craft.
