The Hrsronr ofthe INQutsrrroN.

Ι. The first is, that the Inquifitors by publishing an Edict of the Faith,
oblige all under the Penalty of Excommunicatiom to inform before them of
every one, whom they suspe& of Heresy for the ssightest Cause·, so that not
only a Relation is bound toaccuse his Relation, a Brother his Brother, and
by his Information to bring him into Danger of being burnt‚ the most horri-
ble of all Punishments3 but even a Wife her Husband, yea, what destroys
all the Laws of Nature, a Son, according to the Opinion of many Doetors,
is bound to inform against his Father‚ if a secret Heretick. And tho‘
some think the Son exempted from this Obligation, yet they say he is to
be commended when he accuses his F ather, because he prefers the Cause of
the Faith and Church to any carnal Relation· Yea, he is sometitnes tempted
by Rewards to give such an Information. For when the Effeets of Hereticks
are confiscated, so that the Son can’t be his Father’s Heir, yet he recovers
his Father's Effe&s as the Reward of informing against him. What is this
better than to solicite by Rewards wicked‚ stubborn and rebe1110us Chssdren,
whom their Parents may have correEted for their dissolute Manners, to ac-
cuse their Parents of seigned Crimes, or at least to become Betrayers of

thern.

ΙΙ. A second Instance of Injustice is, their condemning a Person, defamed':
only for Heresy, to make canonical Purgation, i. e. to purge himself with

seven, more orless, Compurgators3 so that if he fails in one, two or three,-
heis accounted guilty. For thus the Life and Torture of any one depends
on the Will and Pleasure of another, and ’tis enough to declare him to be
an Heretick, if one of the Compurgators dares not swear, that he believes
to be true, what the defamed Person afferts upon his Oath. And altho’
they confess that canonical Purgation is a very deceitful Method‚ their

Injustice can't be excused, because notwithstanding this, they use it in⁴

their Court.

III. A third is, that in this office, every one, tho’ excluded by other
CourtS, is admitted for a Witness, a mortal Enemy only excepted.

IV. To this rnay be added afourth, that the Names of the Witneffes are
not shewn to the Prisoner, nor is any Circumstance discovered to him by
which he can come to the Knowledge of the Witnesses. Who doth not seer.
that the Defence of the Prisoners is maimed and imperfetst, who, tho’ accused,
as they think, of the most heinous Crime, hath no Adversary against whom*
he can defend himself, but like blind and groping Persons, must endeavour
to find him out, whilst, in the mean while, they are ordinarily accused by,
and make their Defence against a different Person? 'Tis well known, that
such is the Wickedness of Mankind, that some will readily endeavour the
DestruCtion of others by false Information and Witness, if they can conceal

themselves, especially if infamous and perjured Persons, guilty of almost
