about the Worship of Images. So that he concludes, that the Ignorance of*

the lnquifitors, in Matters of Faith, exceeds all Belief. Father Ephraim al-

so affimned, That nothing was so troublesome to him in the Prison of the In-

quifflion, as the Ignorant-e of the Inquisitor and his Affessors, when they ex-

amined him, which was so very great, as that he verily believed not one of
them had ever read the holy Scriptures. And therefore as the Inquifitors are

thus ignorant themselves, they greatly want the Advice, not only of Persons.
skill‘ul in both Laws, or as they call thern, of Canonists and Layers, but of
Divines alle. They are generally called Affeffors and Counsellors.

They have their-distinet Parts. They are not all indifferently consulted in
all Affairs, but each of them as to those which they are presumed to under-
stand. The Divines are called in to examine Propofitions, and explain their
Qality. The Layers are consulted about the Punishment or Absolution of
Offenders, and other Merits of Causes. The Inquifitors generally consult and
deliberare with these skilful Persons together, and not apart, as is provided in.
certain Letters of the Spamfh Counsel.

XVhen therefore any Question happens in the Cognizance of the Causes of
Heresy at the Tribunal of the F aith, relating to the Qality of Propofitions,
spoken by'Hereticks, or Persons suspefted of Heresy, the Decifion of that.

* Dr. Geda'es gives ns a worse account of their Stupidity and Ignorance. The Writer of the
Repertcrium‚ printed at Venice, An. 1588. to sttcw his critical Learning, saith, the word Haere-
tiam, according to some, is compounded of Erro and Rebilo, because an Heretick errs from what>
is right. According to others, ic is derived from Erciscor‚ which fignifies to divide—3 and, ac-
aordingto some, it comes from Aa'kaereo, because it is one‘s adhering obstinately to an Error that
makes him an Herctick. And with the same Stock of Learning it was that another Inquilitor

proved, from St. Paul's words, Haereticam devita, that Christians were commanded to deprive He-
rcxicks ostheir Livcs. Geddes Tmfls, Vel.1. p. 425.
