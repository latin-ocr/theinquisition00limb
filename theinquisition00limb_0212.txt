44 The H1sromr of the INQu181T10N.

The Opinions that are ascribed to the Albigenses‚ but never to the Valdenſss3

pt. 40· are these ι That there are two Gods and Lords 3 the one good, the other evil⁶

That the Creatz'on of all Things‚ vzfible and corporeal, was not from God our bea:-

venly Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, hut by the Devil and Satan, the evil

God, who is the God of this erd, and the Maker and Prince of it: Which

fotos. they express elsewhere in this Manner: That it was not God that caused the

Earth to yield Seed and bring forth Fruit. And elsewhere: That the good

God made all ‘Things invisible and incorruptible3 and that the evil Prince, viz.

Lucifer, made all Yhings vzfihle ancl corruptible, and even humane Bodies.

fot. 120.b· And in another Place: That there were two Gods, one good, the other bad ς.
and that the bad God created all Things vistble.

Since these Things are to be met with in the Sentence of Petrus Amerina-2
one of their famons Dostors, Iam apt to think, not only that some of the·
Manicheam, who were banished from Asta, and carne into Bulgaria, and af·
terwards went into the Country of Tholwse, lurked amongst thern ·, but that
they had, many of them at least, embraced the Monichaean opinions. And
indeed, we ought not to conceal the Truth. For although they are το·- be
commended for having discover’d many of the Romish Errors in Doctrine, ·
and for their forsaking, the Communion of that Church; yet we ought in·
genuoussy to own their MistakeS. And as their recommending to those they
received into their Communion‚ what they called the Endura, i. e. fasting
themselves to Death‚ was certainly an Error in Praffice 3 so that we need not
be affiamed to own that they sometimes erred in Matters of F aith. ’Tis ra*-
ther to be wonder’d at, that in so barbarous an Age, they should throw off-
so many Errors, than that they should retain some.

But befides, they are said also to have held the following OpinIOns.
