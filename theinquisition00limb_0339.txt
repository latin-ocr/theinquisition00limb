those alrgady provided. Gregory XI. by a Bull beginning, Catholicae Fidei 1⁷:ae-
gotium, gives the Inquifitors free Power of going to the Court of Rome, and
abiding there, and of taking an Affistant without the Licence of 'nis Order¹
and of changing such an Affistant, and of taking another out os his Province,
and of keeping him with him as often as he shall judge fit, any Prohibition
of Prelates or Chapters to the contrary notwithstanding.

INQUISITION.

ΓΓ Η Ε Inquifitors were originally religious F riars, skilful only in Divinis Emer,

easily deceived in a judiciary Process, and so absolve such as lhould be con· Pegna,
demned, and condemn such as should be absolved, they were commanded to
call in skilful Persons, such as Divines, Canonists and Layers, to consult
them, and if there was need to compe] thern to give their Advice in V irtue

lib. 6. T hat you also call in as Occafion requires, any skifful Persons to affist you, and
give you proper Advice in paffingsuch Sentences, and enjoin them by Virtue of their
Obedience, thatin this Matter they humbly obey you. And thus we often find it
in the Book of the Tholouse Inquifition‚ in the Sentences pronounced: lVe the
aforesaid Bishop and Inquzfitor, with the Advice and Counsel of many good Men
skifful as well in the Canon as Civil Law, and of many prudent religious
Perfims, &c. I do not find that their Number is precisely determined by

any certain Law. Carena says, that in the Congregation at Cremona, there P. μείης,

are regularly present, four Regular Divines, four Secular Clergymen, Ca· η· 1⁷·-
nonists, and four Lay Counsellors 3 and because the Inquifitor there is always

a Master in Divinity, they don’t need so many other Qalificators, as the In· 1bid.n.35.
quifitors of Spain do, who are Layers.

’Tis to be wonder'd at, that the Office of making Inquifition against He-
reticks, and of judging thern, should be committed to Persons entirely ig-
norant of the Law. But if we confider the modern Inquisitors‚ and compare
thern with the more ancient ones, and judge of their Ignorance by what we
find of the Ignorance of the other, it must be owned that they know nothing
either of Law, or of Divinity, or of any Theological Points. The Au· cazze·

tism of the Breath * could be reconciled with those VVords of our Lord‚ John

was astonilhed at the citing of this Place, and asked where the Paffage was
