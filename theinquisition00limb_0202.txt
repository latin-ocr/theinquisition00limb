34 The HssToRY of the INQulsxnoN.

Justice of the'Persecution raised against them. And in the former Part of hig
Letter, he argum, that they ought to be compelled to return to the Church‚
not by Reason only, but by Terrors. For, says he, if they should be terrified‚
and not taught, it would seem to be the Exercifie of an unjust Power over them3 and

if they were taught, and not terrified, their old Habits would harden them, and they
would move more stowly into the Way of Salvation.

The like may be read in his 50th Epistle, to Boniface, a military Man ¹of
Ccefizr’s Retinue: A Perstm in a raging Phrenzy can’t bear the Phyfician‚ nor a
libertine Son his Father ·‚ the one because he is bound, the other because he is chastzstd ;
both because they are loved. But zf they neglect them, and suffer them to perish, 'tis
a false and cruel Mildness ·, for if the Horse and Mule, who have no Understanding‚
bite and strike at those who handle them to cure their Wounds‚ who yet, tho’ they are of-
tentimes in Danger, and sometimes receive Mischief, don't leave them, till by medi·
cinal Smart and Pains they have made them sound ·, how much less ought one Manto
be given up by another, a Brother by his Brother, lest he perzfh eternally ; when
after Correttion he might be brought to understand, how great a Benefit was conferred
on him, even when he was complaining of suffering Persecution. Thercfore, as the
Apostle says, Let us do good to all as we have Opportunity ·, let those, that can,
clo it by Discourses of the Catholick Precepts, others by the Laws of CatholickPrinces,
that all may be called to Salvation, and recovered from Destruttion, partly by thofie
who obey divine Admonitions, and partly by those who obey the Imperial Commands.
When the Emperors make bad Laws in Favour of Falshood against the T ruth, true Be-
lievers are approved, and those who persevere are crowned with V ittory. But when
they ordain good Laws for the Truth, in Opposition to Error, the Unruly are ter·
rified, and the Wse amended. He therefore who refuses to obey the Imperial
Laws, when made against the Truth of God, acquires a great Reward: He who
refuses to obey, when made for Support of divine ‘Truth‚ exposes himself to most grievous
Punishment. For in the Times of the Prophets all thofh Kings are blamed, who did

of Idols, {mile an impious Law, thalg the Image should b’e worshipped. But those
who did not obey his wicked Constitution, atted piously and faithfully. And yet the
same King, changed by a divine Miracle‚ made a pious and commendable Law for the
‘Truth-‚ that whoever should blaspheme the true God of Shadrack, Meffiack, and
Abednego, should be destroy'cl with his whole House. ΕΤ hose who despised this Law,
and deservedly suffered the Penalty of it, might yet say, what these do, that they
were rigbteous Perfhns, because persecufted by the King’s Law3 which they might

do these Things by the Imperial Laws made for the Unity of Christ, they vainly boast of
their Innocence, and seek thc Glory of Martyrdom from Men, which they cannot re-
ceive from the Lord. After which he subjoins a long Discourse to prove, that
all who suffer Persecution are not Martyrs‚ but such only who suffer for Righ-
teousness ; and that all Persecutors are not of the false Church. For Agar stif-

fered Persecution from Sarah3 and yet she who perftcuted ‘tows holy, antisshebrwhy²
