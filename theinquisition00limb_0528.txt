98 The H1sr0mr of the INQUISITION.

dom as to those who have never received it, as to cmy Obligation of human Low,
though not as to the Divine, anci therefore such Men ought not to be compelled. God will
punish them. But os to such who hove profeffi’d Faith in Baptifhz, Faith is not free
from Obligation either of the divine or human Low, and therefore they compes
Mento preserve it. Again, Liberty isso taken asto distinguish it from Neceffity‚
and in this Sense 'tis free whether a Mon will believe or no, &Q But that 1 may
by the way refute this Foundation of Popish Persecution, Ι would observe that
neither Bellarmiue nor any of the Popish Crew will ever be able to shew, that
by receiving Baptism‚ there is any Obligation whatsoever to human Laws con-
traffited. The Vow is made to God, and the Person baptized obliges himself
by Baptism to God only, and not to any Man, and therefore he receives Bap-
tism in the Name ofthe Father‚ Son and Holy. Ghost ⁴, and as our Saviour
commands this For-m of Baptism to be observed‚ he evidently ffiews that a
Person hereby becomes devoted only to God3 nor doth the baptized Person
make any, either express or tacit Promise, by which he lays himselfunder Ob-
]igation to any Man.. He professes himselfa Disciple of Jesus Christ, binds
himself to observe his Commands, ancl acquires a Right to those spiritual Bles-
fings which God seals his Title to by Baptism. So that here is nothing tot
be found by which a Person binds himselfto any Man, or renders himself ob-
rzoxious to human Punishment if he departs from the Faith, and from an holy
Life. All Things in this Transafflon are divine and spiritual. 'Tis from·
God he expe&s the Remission of Sins and eterna] Life, if he observes those
Things to which he binds himselfin Baptism. Ifhe breaks his baptismal Vow
by Apostacy and Profaneness of Life, he will experience the divine Punish-
rnent⁹ So that herein there is no Change madeas to any human Obligation3
nor is he by Baptism more bound to ans Man whatsoever than· he was bem
fore. It may be said perhaps, that by Boptism he is made a Member of the-
ebarci-12· He is so·‚ but doth not on this Account come under any human
obligation, and cannot therefore be obnoxious to the Decrees of any Man„
but to those only of Gode, which if he departs from, he immediately ceasesu
to bea Member of the Church, and therefore the Church may declare that
heis no longer a Member of her Bedy, and that therefore he hath no Hopes
remaining of the Remission of Sins, and eternal Life. And the Church may
ronounce just the same os those who have never been baptized, nor profes-
led the Christian Fasti), And therefore I conclude, that if any one falls from
the Faith into an Heresy truly such, he doth not depart from any Obliga-
tion he is under to the Church, or to any Man, bnt from that which he is
under to God, whose Word only he is bound to obey as the sole Rule of
his Faith ·, and that therefore he is to be punished by God only with a spi-r
ritual and eternal Punishment, and not by any Man with a corporal Punish--
ment. This by the way, ·
To return therefore to our Purpose. The inquisition was not introduced
to compel the Jews to the Christian Religion3 because, say they, as they
are not baptizetl, and have not profeffed the Faith ot Christ, they cannot

be said to. be Hereticks or Apostates, and therefore are not subje& to ‘QZ-Ju-
