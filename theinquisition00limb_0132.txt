cf our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Doc‘zlrt’ne which is according to Godliness. This ait
genuine Christians receive, out of regard toa much higher Authority than be-
longs to any Set of Men in the World ; and therefore the Sanc‘tion of Fa-
thers and Councils in this Cast, is as impertinent as a Man's pretending to
give a Sanfftion to the Constitutions of the Great God. And as to all other
Articles of Faitin neither they, nor any others, have any Commiffion to impose
them on the Consciences of Men, and the Moment they attempt to do it,
they cease to 'oe Servants in the House of God, ancl a& as the true and pro-
per Lords of the Heritage.

But it may be said, That the Chttrch bath Power to determine in Controversia
of Rath ,- so as not to decree ακςν thing agnis-,st Scriptum, nor to enforce any thing to
be believed as neceffmy to Sale-atim besides it3 i. e⁴ Ι suppose the Church harh
Potver to guard the Truths of Scripture ‚- and in any Controversies about
Boon-ines, to determine what is or is not agreeable to Scriptum, and to en-
force the Reception of what they thus decree, by obliging others to sub-
scribe to their Decifions. If this be the Case, then it necessarily follows,
that their Determinations must be ever right, and constantly agreeable to the
Docirine of holy VVrit5 and that they ought never to determine, but when
they are in the Right, and are sure they are in the Right3 because, if the
Matter be difficult in its Nature, or the Clergy have any Doubts and Seru.-
ples concerning it, or are liable to make false Decifions‚ they cannot, with
any Reason, make a final Decisron3 because ’tis possible they may decide
on the wrong fide of the Qestion ,· and thus decree Falshood instead of
Trurh. And Ι presume there are but few who will claim, in XVords, so ex-
traordinary a Power as that of establishing Falssiood 'm the room of Truth
and Scripture. And even suppofing their Decifions to be right, how will
it follow that they have a Power to oblige others to submit to aad subscribe
them ? If by found Reason aud Argument they can convince the Conscien-
ces of others, they are sure of the Agreement of all such with them in Princi-
ple5 and upon this Foot Subscriptions are wholly uselessz, and {f they can-
not convince them, 'tis a very unrighteous Thing to impose Subscriptions
on them5 and a ssiameful Prevarication with God and Man for any to sub-
mit to them without it. Decifions made in Controverfies of Faith, by tho*
Clergy, carry in them no Force nor Evidence os Truth. Let their Office be
ever so sacred, it doth not exerrpt them from human Frailties and Imper-
sections. They are. as liable to Error and tvtistake, to Prejudice and Paffion,
as any of the Laity whatsoever can be. How then can the Clergy have any
Authority in Controverfies of Fairh, which the Laity have not? Tim they
have erred in their Decffions, anci decreed Light to be Darkness, and
Darkness Light ; that they have perplexed the Consciences of Men, and cor-
rupted the Simplicity of the Faith in Christ, all their Councils and Synods
are a notorious Proof· With what Justice or Modesty then can they pre-
tend to a Power of obliging others to believe their Articles, or subscribe
them? If I was to speak the real Truth‚ it will be found, that those
numerous Opinions which have been anathematised as Heretical, and which
