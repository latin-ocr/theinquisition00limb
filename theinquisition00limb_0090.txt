cula, not owing to any Blemish of'nis Life, nor to any impious Tenets that he
held in Matters of Parth, but to this only cause ·‚ the Difference of our Opi-
nions about Solomon’s Songs‚ and the Article of Christ’s Descent into Hell.
But how is this Testimonial, that Csq'tellio had no macula vitae, was unblame-
able as to his Life, rcconcileable with the Appeal to God, that he was
proud and perfidious‚ and void of Humanity‚ and a profeffed Scoffer at Reli-
gion, whilst he dwelt at Casviffls House? If this Charge was true, How
came Calvia and his Friends to apppoint him Master of a School, and judge
him worthy the sacred Ministry ? Or if he was of so bad Character once, and
afterwards gave the Evidence of a sincere Repentance by an irreproachable
Beliaviour, what Equity or Justice, what Humanity or Honour, was there in
publishing to the World Faults that had been repented of and forsaken ? Cascellio
solemnly protests that he had never injured Cal-vin, and that the sole Reason of
his Displeasure against him was because he differed from him in Opinion. On
this Account he endeavoured to render him every where Impious, prohibited
the Reading of his Books; and, what is the last Effort of Enrnity, endea-
voured to excite the civil Magistrate against him to put him to Death. But
God was pleased to prote& this good Man from the Rage of his Enemies. He
died at Bafil, in Peace,3 and received an honourable Burial‚ the just Reward of
his Piety‚ Learning, and Merit.

Ι may add to this Account, Calvin’s Treatment of one Jerom Bolsec‚ who
from a Carmelite Monk had embraced the reformed Religion, but held the
Doctrine of Free-will and Predestination upon the Forefight of good WorkS.
Calvin was present at a Sermon preached by him at Geneva, upon these Arti-
cles, and the Sermon being ended, publickly opposed him in the Congregation.
When the Assembly was dismissed, poor Bolsec was immediately apprehended,
and sent to Prison, and soon after, by Calvin's Counsel‚ banished for Sedition
and Pelagianism from the City, and forbid ever to come into it, or the Terri-
tories of it under Pain of being whipped‚ A. C. 1551.

But Calvin's Treatment of the unfortunate Servetus was yet more severe.

x ι His Book entitled‚ Restitutio Christianismi, which he sent in MS. to Calvin,

enraged him to that Degree, that he afterwards kept no Temper or Measures
with him, so that as Bolsec and Uytenbogczert relate, in a Letter written by
him to his Friends Viret and Farel, he tells them, That ifthis Heretick (Servetus)

Biblioth, should ever fall into his Hamis, he would take Care that hefhould lose his Life. Serve-

tus his lmprisonment at Vienne, soon gave him an Opportunity to ssiew his Zeal
against him : For, in Order to strengthen the Evidence against him, Calvia

&a υἷες, sent to the Magistrates of that City, the Letters and VVritings which Servetus
Art, v111.h³d sent to him at Geneva. This is evident from the Sentence it self against

him, in which those Writings, as well as his printed Book, are expressy men-
tioned as containing the Proofs of his Heresy. whether Calvin sent them of
his own Accord, or, at the Defire of the Magistrates of Vienne, Ι lhall not
presume to determine. Ifof his own Accord‚ it was a base Officiousness, and if
at the Request of those Magistrates, it wasa most unaccountable Conduct in a
