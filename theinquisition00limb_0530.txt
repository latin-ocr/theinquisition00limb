quisition against Hereticks, you do diligently and carefully enquire out the Truth
concerning the Premiffe5‚ as well with respec‘l to Christians as to Jews, and thot you
endeavour to proceed against those, whom you shall find hitherto to have committed
these Things, or who shall commit them for the future, as against Herencks, the Fa-
vourersalso, Receivers, and Defenders of Hereticks. And as to those Jews, who
have persuaded Christians of either Sex to embrace their execrable Rites, and whom
you shall find hereafter endeavouring to persuade them, let them undergo the deser·
ved Punishment. Compel all Contradic‘tors by the Ecclefiastical Consum, without al-
lowing them any Appeal ·, calling, if there be Need, to your Afflstance in this Affair,
the ecular Arm.

’ζ here are also extant the like Records, in the Acts of the Inquifition at
Fert-ara, written in parchment, which Campegius gives u3‚ two of which I
shall here only transcribe. The one is a Letter of Latinus D'Ursinis, Cardinal
Legate of Romagliona and Tuscany‚ to the Inquifitor of Ferrara, A..D.. 1280,
and second of the Pontificate ofNicholas 111. Our Beloved in Christ, Boniface of
Ferrara, heretosore a Jew‚ but now, through the Gracc of Christ, converted to the
Catholick Fauo, bath declared to us, that the Jews dwelling at Ferrara, being
stirred up against him by a malignam Spirit, endeavour to oppreſs him with grievous
Persecutions, and invent wicked “Things to his Destruetion 3 on which Account he can·
not dwell in the aforesaid City without Fear of Danger. Wherefore he hath humbly
besought us, that we would take Care to provide him with proper Affistance in this
Difficulty. Since therefore ’tis very unworthy, that such who forstzking the Error of
Jewiss] Blindness‚ have returned to the Light of the Christian Faith, should ficffer
Persecution and Injuries from those who remain in Darkness it sels, we command your
Discretion, by the Authority we are invested with, that you receive under your
Protenion the said Bonifizce, and all others, who are converted to the Catholick Faith‚
in the City and Diocese of F errata, or who shall be hereafter converted 3 and that
you take Care to protet't‘ ana* defend them from the aforefizid Jews, by restraining the
fhid Jews from their Insolencies and Blasphemies against the Orthodox Faith‚ as to
γῖα βαίίἰῙεεΞ convenient. Calling in, if Need be, in this Affair, the Affistance of
t e ecu ar rm.

'1[ he other is the Answer of several Divines of Padua, Bologna, and Fert-ara,
to eight Articles prpposed by the said Inquifitor os Ferrara, which, as ’tis

abridged by Campegzus, I shall here faithfully transcribe.
F irst, 'tis asked, Whether a Jew baptized‚ and converted to the Christian Faith,

becomes subjel? to the Officeof the Inquifitor ²f he apostatises from the Truth o the
said Faith to Judaism‚ and denies the Christian Faith which he hath receive , and
may by him be compelled and condemned as other Hereticks, ²f he contemptuousty re-

fuses to hold the Faith he hath received.

The Answer of the wisc Men of Padua‚ A. D. 1281. to this Qestion is, Yhat
fitcb a one is suly‘ee‘? to the Office of the Inquisttion, and that he may be proceeded
against as well as any other Heretick. Yhose of F errara said the same, viz. that the
Inquifitor can, and ought to proceed against baptized lem, who have afterwards ⁴re-

named to judaism.
