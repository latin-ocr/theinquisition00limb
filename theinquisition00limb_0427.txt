 

The HisToRY osthe INQUISITION. 239

’'ris also' provided in Spain, by many ConstitutionS, that Inquifitors,
who receive Gifts incur the Sentence of Excommunication, and are de-

; prived of their Office, and fined double the Value of what they take. Sim-mc.
ἢ This holds if they take Gifts from their Officials. 'Tis ordain’d al-deCatl‘vl'·
¹ so, by the same lnstrufflons, That all the Officers shall be content with inst< '· 341·
their Stipends‚ and receive no Gifts; not so much as any Thing to drinkn' 45*

Α or eat, And if any one is convicted of doing it, he is deprived of his Office,

must pay double the Sum, incurs the Sentence of Excommunication,

and is fined in 10000 Pieces. If any one of the Officers knows of any

such Thing, and doth not discover it to the Inquifitors, he must suffer

the same Punishment. The Words of the Instruffion, An, 1484. Cap. 1.

are these: They have likewzst decreed, that the Inquisttors and Affiffors of the In-
quffltion, and other their Officials, such as Advocates, Fistczls, Execm‘ors, Nola-

* m'es, and Door-keepers, shall receive no Gifts or Money from any Persem what-
Jbever, which the said Inquisition doth or may lay hold of, nor from any other Per-

sons appointed by. them.. And the Inqmsstor General shall command them not to re-

ceive any Thing under Pain of Excommuni'cation, Deprz'vation of Offices, which

they hold from the holy Inquisition, and returnz'ng double¹ of what they take,

But Paramus doth not interpret this Constitution‚ so as to make the In· Lib. 3·
quifitors, who are criminal in this Respe& actually incur Excommunica-q.2.n.68„.
y tion, and Deprivation of Office, but only so as to make thern liable to this
’ Puni-ffiment from the Inquifitor General. He also believes, ifit be a small
Matter, the Inquifitors may take it when voluntarily offer'd to thern. But
’tis his Judgment that they would do better to take nothing at all, neither
from the Crimina]s‚ which looks very suspicions, nor from their Relations or
Friends, or any other Persons whatsoever.

Every Minister of the Inquisition is also forbidden to concern himself in any simam.
Traffick‚ either by himself or other Persons: If any one doth, heis cie-de Cario-7»
prived of his Office, and fin’d 20000 Pieces. If any one doth not discover ¹³³st·²·³³¹‘
this, he is excommunicated, 4 Inst. Tolet. c. 12. ⁷¹' 33⁵

The Inquisitors, Ministers, and Receivers, are also forbidden to buy any ς, 29·-
Thing of the confiscated Effects, although they are publickly sold, If any ¹
one doth-buy any of thern, though openly and honestly, he nevertheless in-
curs the Sentence of Excommunication, and is fined in an 100 P-ieces of Gold,

Howev{r‚ as the Author of the History of the Inquifition at (ἶσα informs C. 2352·
us, the Inquifitors know how to amass vast Riches, by two Methods. When
the Effects of the Prisoners, after Confiscation, are sold by the Cryer‚ the
Inquifitors, notwithstanding this Interdi&‚ usually send one of their Dome-
sticks, who bid a low Price for such Things as their Masters want, being
pretty secure that no Body else will out-bid them.·‚ and by this Means they
buy very valuable Things for half price, οι· less. Befides this, the Inquisi-
t-ors have a Right to demand the Payment of the Expences, and other neces-
sary Charges they have been at, when, and in what Sums they plesse, when-

ever the Money arising from the Confiscations is carried into the Royal {frea-
