the Deposition must be broke off, and it must be minuted down, that the Ex-
amination was dismissed thro’ the Lateness of the Hour, and that the De-
nouncer was ordered to return soon to the holy Office. And this he must
subscribe, When he comes again to continue his Denunciation, he must again
take his Oath before the Inquifitor and Notary, touching the holy Scriptures,
that he will speak the Truth, and be admonished to report what he omitted in
his former Appearzmce, such a Day of the Month in this holy Office. But is
it can be done, tho’ with some Inconvenience to the Judge, they say Care
must be taken not to interrupt the Depofitions of the Denouncers, or Witnes„
ses who are cited.

Sometimes the Denouncers bring with them their Denunciation written
down by themselves, which they give to the Inquifitor. When this is done,
the Inquisitor receives it in the Place of Audience, and gives it to the Notary
to insert in the Process. The Notary also further inserts in the Aes, that Na
delivered his Denunciation in Writing to the said Inquisitor, containing so many
Leaves, beginning thus, &a and ending thus, &a and the Inquisitor com-
mands the Denouncer to subscribe his Name.

When the Denouncers are not present themselves, and denounce any onescap. ς,
Heresy, notin Person, but by private Letters, such a Denunciation may be
also received by the Inquifitor, if the Writer of the Letters be a Person os
Credit, dwelling in remote Places, or fick, or prevented by any legal Impe-
diment, so that he cannot eafily come himself to the Inquifitor3 or is he be
detained upon account os any peculiar Quality, such as NunS, or other hoa
nourable Women, who must not easily be drawn by others into any publiclc
Cause‚ But the Inquisitors may supply the Dese& in this manner of denoun-
cing¹ by this Method, either by going himself with the Notary to the De-
nouncer, and examining him in the Manner already described 3 or by send-
ing his Colleague or Vicar to him with the Denunciation Letters, concerning
which he examines the Denouncer in the usual Manner, to know whether they
are his, and with what Defign and Reason written. Or if the Inquifitor hath
already in such Places a Vicar or Commiffary appointed, he may write to
him, and send* him the private Letters of Denunciation‚ to examine the De-
nouncer upon Oath after the usual Manner. As to the Denunciation made Annona>
by a Nun, she is obliged tor denounce before her Confeffor, who demands casem
Leave and F acu-Ity from the Inquisitor to receive the Denunciation, which asn· 4·
specially deputed he takes, fi-rst giving her her Oath, making her subscribe,
and enjoining her Secresy. And he must thoroughly interrogate and search
her. But in this Case, the Confeffor must receive from the Nun a Command
of making Denunciation to the Inquifitor out of Confeffi on. The F orm which
they observe in taking this Denunciation is as follows. Such a one was dijmzffl’d from
her Confeſjor, who would not absolve her, unless she denounced to the holy Office‚ Up-

Inquisttor, the Day . . . . Month ...... Year. . . . . . aud being given her Oath,
which she took touching the most holy Gospels, she denounced, for the exonerating her
