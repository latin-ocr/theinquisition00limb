“ ville, and having laid before the holy Tribunal the Instruments and an
“ other necessary VVritings, demanded that the Goods should be delivered to
“ him. The Lords answered, that the Affair must be managed in Writing,
‘⁶ and that he must chuse himself an Advocate, undoubtedly to prolong the
“ Suit, and out of their great Goodness appointed him one, to draw up for
“ him his Petitions and all other Instrumenrs, which were to be offer'd to the
‘⁶ holy Tribunal‚ for every one ofwhich they exorbitantly took from him eight
“ Reals, altho’ he received no more Advantage from them, than if they had
“ never been drawn at all. Frontom waited for three or four whole Months,
“ twice every Day, viz. in the Morning, and after Dinner, at the Gates of
“ t'ne inquisitor’s Palace‚ praying and beseeching‚ on his bended Knees, the
“ Lords lnquifitors, that his Affair might be expedited, and especially the
“ Lord Bilhop of Tarraco, who was then chief Inquisttor at saville, that he
“ in Virtue of his supream Authority would command his Effects to be re-
“ stored to him. But the Prey was too large and rich to be eafily recovered.
‘⁶ After he had spent four whole Months in fruitless Prayers and Intreaties, he
“ was answered‚ that the-re was need of some other Writings from England,
“ more ample than those he had brought before, in order to the Recovery
“ of the Effeets. Upon this the Englg'fhman immediately returns to London,
⁶‘ and procures the Instrumenta of fuller Credit which they demanded, comes
“ back with them to Seville, and laid them before the holy Tribunal. The
“ Lords put off his Answer, pretending they were hindred by more impor-

tant Affairs. They repeated this Answer to him every Day, and so put

‘⁶ him off for four whole Months longer. When his Money was almost spent,
‘⁶ and he still continued earnestly to press the Dispatch of his Affair, they
“ referred him to the Bishop. The Bil‘hop, when consulted, said he was
“ but one, and that the expediting the Matter belonged also to the other
“ Inquifitor53 and by thus shifting the Fault from one to the other, there·
‘³‘ was no Appearance of an End of the Suit. But at length being overcome
ζ’ by his Importunity‚ they fixed on a certain Day to dispatch him. And

the Dispatch was this: The Licentiate Gascus, one of the Inquifitors, a

ζ’ Man well skilled in the Frauds of the inquisition, commands him to come

⁸ to him after Dinner, The Englishman was pleased with this Mefl'age, and
Z went to him about Evening, believing that they began to think in good

Earnest of restoring him his Effects, and carrying him to Mr. Burton the

“ Prisoner, in order to make up the Account, having heard the Inquisitors
:2 often say, tho’ he did not know their real Meaning, that it was neceffary

that he and the Prisoner should confer together. When he came, they

Z: commanded the Jayl-Keeper to clap him up in such a particular Prison,

which they named to him. The poor Englzfhman believed at first, that he

‘³‘ was to he brought to Burton to settle the Account, but soon found· him-
6

self a Prifoner in a dark Dungeon, contrary to his Expestation, and»

‘⁰' that he had quite mistaken the Matter. After three· or four Days they
“ brought him to an Audience, and when the Englt'fhmcm demanded that the·
ff Inquilitors should restore his Effests to him, they well knowing that it

{f would.
