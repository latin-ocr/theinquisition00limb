fest 'l‘ruch lt arises-from extet-nal Signs of Affions or VVords, by which ir
may be concl-uded effectually, and almost always, that he who says or doth
these Things is an Hei-etick. As if heretofore any one should adore Here-

Communion from them, or do the like Things belonging to their Custom.

y A gerson lightly suspested, is enjoined Canonical Purgation, or even a light
Abjuration. In this Case however the Proceeding must be cautious3 because
ifany one falls into the like Suspicion afier Abjuration‚ he must be more grie-
vously punished. Cap. Accusatus. In princip. A Person accused or szespeHed of Here-
sy, against whom there is arisen great and vehement Suspicion of this Crime, zf in Judg-
ment he abjures his Heresy, and afterwards falls into the same Suspirion, ought t'o
he looeed on as a Relapse by a certain Construt't'ion of Law, although before his Ab·
juration the Crime (ff Heresy hath not been proved. But ifsuch Suspicion shall be light
‘and moderate, although on this Account he is to be more grievoussy pumfhed, yet he
is not to be punished as those who relapfie into Heresy.

A Person vehemently suspezsted is not an I-Ieretick, nor can he be punilhed
,as an Heretick. Ex:ra. de praesumpt. c. literas. §. roirca. where 'tis express·

condemned for so grievous a Crime. But he must be commanded to abjurege-
nerallyevery Heresy, and especially that in which he offended, as a Person
vehemently suspeehed. And this is no light Punishment. Because if he af·
:erwards relapses either into his former Heresy, or any other, or associat&
with those whom he knows to be Hereticks, or affords them such 'Favour
as is capable of no Excuse, he incurs the Penalty of the Relapsed. Cap.
Accusatus. where we have these Words. But as to the Person who offends in one
Sort or Seu of Heresy, or errs in one Article of Faith or Sacrament of the Church,
and afterwards shall ahjai-e simply or generally his Heresy ·, if after this he offendi by
jalling into another Sort or Sea? of Heresy, or errs in any other Article or Sacra-
ment‚ we will that he shall he judged as one relapsed into Heresy. He also, concern-

who, after such Ahjuration, shall receive, accompany, vistt‚ or affociate himself with
Hereticks‚ or shall make or send them Presents or Gifts, or grant them such Favour as

Consequence of the former Error he approved. If he doth not consent immedi-

he continues under Excommunication for a Year, he must be condemned as an
