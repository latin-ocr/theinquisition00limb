resy that extols it self against the holy Roman and Apostolick Church‚ and
particularly the Heresy of which he was ssightly suspefflzed, naming that He-
resy: And that if he shall do any of the aforesaid things for the future, he
willingly submits to the Penalties appointed by Law ro one who thus ab-
jures, and is ready to undergo every Penance, as well sor the things he hath
said and done, as for those concerning which he is deservedly suspected of
Heresy, which they shall lay on him, and that with all his Power he will
endeavour to sulfill it. After this Abjuration the Inquifitor says to him, Son,
Thou hast purged away by this Abjuration‚ the Suspicion, which, not without Cauje,
we entertained of you. Henceforth take heed to your self, that you don’tfall into this
abjured Heresy 3 for altho’ z'f you repent, you would not be delivered over to the se·-
cular Arm, because you have abjured as one slightly stcspeoted only, and not vehement-
ly, yet you would be much more severely punished than zf γοα had not abjured‚ and
instead of being slightly fitspebi‘ed, would become vehemently so, (md made to abjuro
as such. And if you should fall again, you would ficffer the Punishment due to re-
lapst’d Perfhm, and be delivered over without Mercy to the secular Court, to be
punished with Death.

If he hath not been publickly susped’ted, he abjures privately after the
same Manner in the-Episcopal Palace‚ or lnquifitors Hall. ’Tis now the
Custom for ssightly suspe&ed Persons to make all their Abjurations in pri-
vate, whether the Fa& be publick or not. Afterwards he is injoin'd Penance
{0} 53th he hath committed, and upon Account of which he was thus
u e e .

ff he is vehemently suspefiaed, he is placed in like Manner upon a Scaffold, n.166.&·
and after he hath taken his Oath upon the Gospels, his Abjuration is deli-seq. com.
vered him in Writing to read before all the People if he can. If he can’tv4¹·
read, the Notary, or some Religious, or Clergyman reads it by Sentences,
paufing between each till the other hath repeated it after him, and so ou
till the whole Abjuration is gone thro’. In this Abjuration he submits him-
self to the Punilhments due to Relapses‚ if he ever after salls into the He-
resy he harh abjured. After the AbjuratIOn is made, the Bishop admonisties
him, that if ever hereaster he doth, or says any Thing by which it can be
proved, that he hath fallen into theHeresy he hath abjured, he will be de·
livered over to the secular Court without Mercy. Then he injoins him Pe-
nance‚ and commands him to observe it, adding this Threatning, that other-
wise he will become a Relapse‚ and may, and ought to bejudged as an Irn-
penitent. Howe-ver, suspected PersonS‚ whether it be ssightly or vehemently,
are not condemned to wear Croffes, nor to perpetual Imprisonment, because
these are the Punishrnents of penitent Hereticks ; tho’ sometimes they are
ordered to wear for a while the Sambenito‚ according to the Nature of their
Offence. Ordinarily they are injoin’d to stand on certain holy Days in the
Gates of such and such Churches‚ holding a burning Taper of such a Weight
in their Hands, and to go a certain Pilgrimage 3 sometimes also they are inr—
prisoned for a while, and afterwards disposed of as is thought proper.
