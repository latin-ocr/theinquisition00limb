the Abbot of Cffleaux, at that Time Apostolick Legate in Famem and thatn· 13·
the Abbot appointed him Inquifitor, at the same Time referring the Affair
to the Pope. After this he was confirmed in the Office by a Cardinal Legate
in that Kingdom 3 and at length, after the Conclufion of the Lateran Council,
Ann. 1216. he was made Inquifitor by Authority of the Pope's Letters,
a Copy of which some Authors affirm they have actually seen.

⁶⁶ When Dominick had received these Letters, upon a certain Day, in thec. .
⁶⁶ Midst of a great Concourse of People, he declared openly in his Sermon,
⁶⁶ in the Church of St. Prullian, that he was raised to a new Offioe by the
⁶⁶ Pope3 adding, that he was* resolved to defend, with his utmost Vigour‚
‘⁶ the Doctrines of the Faith·, and that if the Spiritual and Ecclefiastical
⁶⁶ Arms were not sufficient for this End, 'twas his fixed Purpose to call in
‘⁶ the Affistance of the Secular Arm, to excite and compelvthe Catholick
‘⁶ Princes to take Arms against Hereticks, that the very Memory of them
⁶⁶ might be entirely destroy'd.’' It evidently appears that Dominick was a
bloody- and cruel Man. This is more than obscurely intimated by the Do-
miniccm, Camillus Campegius, Inquifitor General of Ferrara, who after-having
recited the Letters ofDominick, in which he declares the Penances-he enjoin- r· 20· ⁸ δ

of Inquzfitom that all may he able to make a Comparisbn between the ancient Severity
made use of to stop the Progreſs of these Crimes, and the present Moderation and Ten-

ln the Beginning, the Inquifitors had no proper Tribunal3 they only en-
quired after Hereticks, their Number‚ Strength..and Riches. After they
had detected them, they informed thessishops, who then had the sole Power
of Jndging in Ecclesiastical Affairs, and sometimes urged them, thar they
should anathematize, and otherwise punish the Hereticks they had discoyered
torhern. Sometimes they-,stirred up Princes πο. take Armsagainst Iffgretitcks ·‚
