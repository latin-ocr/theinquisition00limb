commanded his impious and heretical Writings to be publickly burm, andde-
clared all his Effeets to be forfeited to the Exchequer of the holy Inquisition.
After this Sentence was read, the Governor of the City and his Officers
threw the Corps, Effigies, and aforesaid Writings into a Cart, and carried
them into the Campo Fiore, a great Multitude of People following after.
When they carne there, the dead Body‚ which as yet in all its Members was
whole and entire, was raised out of the Chest as far as the Bottom of the
Breast, and ssiewn from on high to the vast Concourse of People that stood
round about, and was afterwards with the Effigies and Bundle of his Books‚
thrown into the Pile prepared for the Purpose, and there burnt.

this very Thing by a certain Writing, beginning, Ad exstirpanda, of which the
