Tfie Rescript of Adrion his Successor to Minoum Fundanus, Pro-Consul of
Asta, seems to have somewhat a'oated the Fury of this Persecution‚ though n'o:
wholly to have put an End to it. Tertullian tells us, that Arrius Antoninus, :rf- Aa ἕως,
terwards Emperor, then Pro-Consul os Asta, when the Christians came in a
Body before his Tribunal, ord‘er'd some of them to be put to Death ·‚ and said
to others, Χ You PVretches! If you wissl die γε have Precipicies ancl Halters. He
also says, Thac several· other Governors of Provinces punished some few Chri-
stians, and dismiffed the rest ·,. so tha-t the Persecution was not so general, nor
severe as under Trajan. x

Under Antoninus Pius the Christians were very cruelly treated in some of the

Provinces of Asta, which occasioned Justin Many-r to write his first Apology,
It doth not however appear to have been done, either by the Order or Consent
of this Emperor. On the contrary, he wrote Letters to the Cities of lisia,
and particularly to those os Lariffa, Thffzlmicu, Athens, and all the Greeks,
That they should create no new Troubles to them. 'Tis probable, that the
Astatick Cities persecuted them 'oy virtue of some former imperial Edifts which
don’t appear ever to have been recalled3 and, perhaps, with the Connivance
ot Antoninus Philofhphus, the Collegue and Successor of Pius in the Empire.

Under him began, as 'tis generally accounted, the fourth Persecution‚ upon
which Justin Martyr wrote his second Apology, Meliton his, and Athenagoras E. H, 1·-5··'-
his Legation or Embaffy for the Christians. Meliton, as Eusebius relates it, c. 26,
complains of it as an almost unheurd ofThing, that pious Men were now persecuted,
and greatly distreffi’d hy new Decrees 'throughout Afia 3 that most impudent Informem,
who were greedy of other Persons Suhstcznce, took Occnfion froin the imperial Editus, to
plunder others who were intirely innocent. After this he hu mbly beseeches the Em-
peror, that he would not suffer the Christians to be any longer used in so cruel
and unrighteous a Manner. Justin Martyr, in the Account he gives of the Apol. offla:
Martyrdom of Ptolemoeus, assures us, that the only Question asked him was,c.4z.Edit‚
PVhether he was a Christian ,Ρ And upon his confessing that he was, he was im· Thirlb.
mediately ordered to the Slaughter. Lucius was also put to Death for making
the same Confeffi0n‚ and asking Urbicus the prestet, why he condemned Pto-
lemy, who was neither convicted of Adustery, Rape, Murther‚ Their, R0b0
bery‚ nor of any other Crime, but only for owning himself to be a Christian.
From these Accounts 'tis abundantly evident, that it was still the very Name
of a Christian that was made capital ·‚ and that these Cruelties were committed
by an Emperor who was a great Master of Reason and Philosophy, not as
Punishments upon Offenders against the Laws and publick Peace, but purely
for the Sake of Religion and Conscience ; committed, to maintain and propa·
gate Idolatry, which is contrary to all the Principles of Reason and Philoso-
phy, and upon Persons ofgreat Integrity and Virtue in Heart and Life, sor their
Adherence to the Worship of One God, which is the Foundation of all true
Religion, and one of the plainest and most important Articles ofir. The Tor-
tures which the-Persecutors of the Christians applied, and the Cruelties they
