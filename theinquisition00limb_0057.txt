Christianity seem indeed to be the least Thing that ‘either the contending Parties
had at beart, by the infamous Methods· they took to establissi themselves and
ruin their Adversaries.

If one reads the Complaints of the Orthodox Writers against the Arians,
one would think the Arians the most execrabie Set of Men that ever lived,
they being loaded w³tb all the Crimes that can poffibly be committed, and
represented as bad, or even worse, than the Devil himself. But no wife Man
will easily credit these Accounts, which the Orthodox give of their Enemies‚
because, as Socrates tells us, This was the Prabi'ice of the Bifhops towards all they· F.. H. 1. π,
deposed, to accuse and pronaunce them impiam, but not to tell others the Reasons 024⁹·
why they accuſsed them as fitch. 'Twas enough-for their Purpose to expofe them·
to the publick Odium, and make them appear impious to the Multitude,
that so they might getthem expeiled from their rich Sees, and be transsated to‘
them in their room. And this they did as frequently as they could, to the in·
troducing infinite Calamities and Confufions into the Christian Churcb. And
if the Writings of the Arians had not been prudently destroyed, Idoubt noe
but we should have found as many Charges laid by them, with equal Justice,
against the Orthodox, as the Orthodox have produced against them·, their
very Suppreffion of the Arian W ritings being a very strong Presumption
against them, and the many imperial Edists of Constantine, Theodosius, Valen-
tinian, Martiam, and others, against Hereticks, being an' abundant Dem0n=
stration that they had a deep Share in the Guilt of Persecution.

Alexander, Bishop of-Alexarzdria, in his Letter· to the Bishop of Constanti-Theoi.
nople, complains that Arius and others, defirous of Power and Riches, did Day¹·1·⁶·4› ἳ-
and Night invent Calumnies, and were continually exciting Seditions and Per=
secutions against him ·, and Arius in his turn, in his Letter to Eusebius of Nico-
media, with too much Justice charges Pope Alexander with violentiy persecuting
and opprefi‘ing him upon account of what he. called the Truth, and ufing everyv
Method to ruin him, driving him out of the City as an atheistical Person, for not
agreeing with him in his Sentirnents about the Trinity. Athanasius also bittera
