“ taken down in Writing, and without mentioning a Word about the resto-

“ to his' Jayl, and commenced an Action against him for an Heretick‚ be-
“ cause he had not repeated the Ave Mary according to the Manner of the
“ Qhurch of Rome, and had left off in a suspected Place, and ought to have
“ added, Holy Mary, Motherof God‚ pray for us Sinners ; by omitting which
‘f Conclusion‚ he plainly discover'd that he did not approve the Interceffion of
“ the Saints. And thus at last upon this righteous Pretence he was detained
“ a Prisoner many Days. After this he was brought forth in Proceffion
“ wearing an Habit‚ all his Principal’s Goods for which he had been su‘no be-
“ ing confiscated‚ and he himself condemned to a Year's Imprisonrnent.²²
But as to suspeeted persons, and those who voluntarily appear, 'tis not usual
to punish them with Confiscation of Effects, and therefore other Punishments',
which they call wholesome Penances, are injoined them. The Punilhments
and Penances to which such Penitents are condemned , are various. Those
which Dominick used to injoin them, in order to their Reconciliation to the
Church, may be colle&ed from his Forms‚ which are still extant. One of
them is in this Manner. To all the Faithful os Christ, to whom these present Letters Bzovius,
