counts of the Transaffions in this Afl‘emffly, given by Athanafizts himself, in his Theod.
Letter to the African 'Bishops‚ it appears, that they were determined to insert E. H.
into the Creed such Words as were most obnoxious to the Arians, and thus τοι· 1.c.8.

force them to a publick Separation ‘from the Church. For when they resolved
co condemn some Expreffions which the Arians were charged with making use
of, such as, ‘The Son was a Creature 3 there was a Time when he was not, and the
1ike 3 and to establish the Use of others in their room, such as, The Son was the
only begotten of God by Nature, the Word, the Power, the only Wsdom of the Fa-
ther, and 'true God; the Arians immediately agreed to it: Upon this the Fa·
thers made an Alteration‚ and explained the Words, From God, by the Son’s
being ofthe Substance ofGod. And when the Arians consented also to this, the
B‘rihops farther added, ro render the Creed more exceptionable, that he was
Conficbstantial, or of the same Substance with the Father. And when the Arians
χοὶῄεῑὲὶεό, that this Expreffion was wholly unscriptural, the Orthodox urged,
that though it was so, yet the Bishops that lived an Hundred and thirty Years
before them, made use of it. At last however all the Council subscribed the
Creed thus altered and amended, except five Bilhops, who were displeased
with the 'Word Consubstantial, and made many Objeftions against it.

Eusebius, Biihop of Ccefhrea, was also in doubt for a confiderable Time, Thaedr
whether he should set his Hand to it, and refused to do it, till the exception-121· c. 12·

able Words had been fully debated amongst them, and he had obtained an Ex-
plication ofthem suitable to his own Sentiments. 'Thus when ’twas asserted by
the Creed, that the Son was of the Father’s Substance, the negative Explication
agreed to by the Bithops was exaffly the same Thing that was afferted by Ari-
as, viz. that ¹¹² He was not a part of the father’s Substance. Again‚ as the
Words‚ begotten, not made, were applied to the Son, they determined the
Meaning to be, that the Son was produced after a different Marmor than the Crea-
tures which he made, and was therefore of a more excellent Nature than any of
the Creatures, and that the Manner of his Generation could not be understood.
This was the very Doctrine of Arius, and Eusebius of Nicomedia, who declar’d,
‘that as the Son was no part of God, so neither was hesrom any Thing created, aad that
the Manner of his Generation was not to be described. And as to the VVord Consisbff
stantia! to the Father, it was agreed by the Council to mean no more, than that
the Son had 720 Likciiess with airy created Beiags, but was in all Things like to him that
begot him, and that he was not from any other Hypostasts or Sabstance but the Father’s.
Of this Sentiment also were Arius, and Eusebius his Friend, who maintained not
only his being of a more excellent Original than the Creatures‚ but ,that he was
formed os aa immutable and ineffable S ubstance and Nature, and after the most perfeit
‘Likencss of the Nature and Power of him that formed him. These were the 'Expli-
cations of these Terms agreed to by the Council, upon which Eusebius of Cas „⁴2-
rea subscribed them in the Creed ς and though some few of the Arian Bishops
,refused to do ir, yet it doth not appear to me, that it proceeded from their not
agreeing in the ⁴Sense of these-Explications, but because they apprehendet] that
