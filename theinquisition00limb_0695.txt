ceptionoftheSacrament of the Eucharist. And these Admonitions they re-
peat till he hath confessed his Sins‚ and humbly defires that the Sacrament of
the Eucharist may be given him, because the Ecclefiastical Sacramenta ,ire
not to be denied to a relapsed Penitent, if he humbly desires them. Cap, Su-

Means being, in their Opinion, rightly prepared for Salvarion, the Bi1ho·.
and Inquifitor order the Ballive of the Place, or the chief Magistrate of the
secular court, to be ready with his Attendants such a Day or Hour, in such a.
street or Place, to receive from their Court such a Relapse‚ which they will
deliver to him ; and that on the same Day‚ or the Day before he lhall make
Proclamation by the Crier throughout the City‚ in all the usual Places and
Streets‚ that on such a Day‚ Hour and Place, the Inquisitor will make a Ser-
mon sor the Faith, and that he and the Bissmp will then condemn a certain
Relapse‚ by delivering him over to the secular Court.

Here they differ, whether acondemned Person may be delivered over to
the secular Court‚ on Sunday, or a Holy-day. In many Cities of Europe ’tis a
Custom, that the Inquifitors do not deliver over to the secular Court Re-
lapses, or ImpenitentS‚ on a Holy-day, but on some other 3 and therefore the
Criminal, two or three Days before he is burnt, is removed from the Houses
or Jayls of the Inquifitors, to the Jayls of the secular JudgeS. But in Spain
and Portugal, all Things relating to the Act of F aith are done on some Fe-
stival‚ to strike the greater Terror into the People.

In like Manner they are not all agreed, whether when the Criminals are
delivered over to the secular Coun, the A& of Faith ought to be celebrated
within the Church‚ or without it. In Spain and Portugal such publici< Acts of
Faith are held without the Church‚ and, generally speaking, in a large and
open Street or Market, and upon very high Scaffolds‚ that all the People
may more easily and clearly see, which could not be done so conveniently
within the Church.

Matters being thus ordered, if the Person to be delivered over to the set-n, 195-
cular Court is in holy Orders, a Priest, or of any other Degree‚ heis, before
he is turned over, stripped of the Prerogative of the whole Ecclefiastical Or·
der, or, as they call it, degraded, that being deprived of every Dignity that
might exempt him from the secular Power, he may be delivered over
10 it.

This Degradation is twofold‚ one verbal, the other aftual. The verbal
is, when the Bishop pronounces Sentence against a Clergyman, by which he
deprives him of all Clerical Orders, or rather of the Ministry or Execution
of those Orders, which is more properly Deposition. The actual is, when
the Clergyman is not only deprIved by Sentence‚ but also deprived a& ually
and personally, stvripped and despoiled of his Ecclefiastical Orders; and this
takes Place in the Crime of Heresy, when the Person is to be deliver’d over
to the secular Court. But if he is only to be ‚perpetuali-y imprisoned, they

only make use of verbal Degradation.
