ment, and-others with Death, under pretence of their having pulled down some
of the Pagan Temples, and insulted himself.

The Truth is, that the Christian Bishops and People shewed such a turbu-
lent aud seditious Spirir, that ’twas no wonder that Julian should keep a jealous
Fye over them, and though otherwise a Man of great Moderation‚ connive at
the Severities his Officers sometimes praelised on them, Whether he would
have proceeded to any farther Extremities against them, had he returned Vi-
&orions from his Peastan Expedition, as {Theodorit affirms he would, cannot, 1*

21·tliink, be determined. He was certainly a Person of great Humanity in his

naturalTemper3 but how far his own Siiperstvtion‚ and the Imprudencies of
the Christians, might have altered this Dispofition‚ 'tis impossible to say,
Thus much is certain, that the Behaviour ofthe Christians towards him, was,
in many Instances, very blameable, and such as (ended to irritate his Spirit,
and awaken his Resentment. But whatever his Intentions were, he did 'not
live to execute them, being ssain in his Perstan Expedition. ‚

He was succeeded by Jovian, who was a Christian by Principle and Profesa

² · sion. Upon his return from Persta the Troubles of the Church immediately re·-

vived, the Bilhops and Heads of Parties crouding about him, each hoping
that he would list on their fide, and grant them Authority to oppress their Ad-
versaries. Athanafius, amongst others, writes to him in favour of the Nicene
Creed, and warns him against the Blasphemies of the Arians ·‚ and though he
doth not direffly urge him to persecute thern, yet he tells him, that’tis ne-
ceffary to adhere to the Decifions of that Council concerning the Faith‚ and
that their Creed was Divine and Apostolical 3 and that no Man ought to reason
or dispute against it, as the Arians did. A Synod also of certain Bishops met at
Antioch in S yria3 and though several of them had been Opposers of the Nicene
Doelsrine before, yet finding that this was the Faith espoused by Jovian, they
with great Obsequiousness readily confirm’d it, and subscribed it, and in a flat·
tering Letter sent it to him, representing that this true and orthodox F aith was
the great Center of Unity. The Followers also of Macedonius‚ who rejezfoed
the Word Confitlgslantial, and held the Son to be only like to the Father, most
humbly besought him, that such who afferted the Son to be unlike the Father
might be driven from their Churches, and that they themselves might be put
into them in their room ς with the Bishops Names subscribed to the Petition.
ButJovian, though himself in the orthodox DoCtrine, did not suffer himself to be
drawn into Measures of Persecution by the Arts of these temporizing Prelates,
but dismissed them civilly with this Answer: I hate Contention, and love thofi’
only that study Peace3 declaring, that he would trouble none upon account of their
Faith‚ whatever it was 3 and that he would favour and csteem such only who should
fhew themselves Leaders in restoring the Peace of the Church. Themistius the Philo-
sopher, in his Oration upon Jovian’s Consulate, commentis him very justly on
this account, that he gave free Liberty to every one to worship God as he would,
and despised the flattering Infinuations of those who would have persuaded him
to the Use of violent Methods, concerning whom he pleasantly‚ but with too
ngucss Til-oth, said, T hat he found by Experience‚ that they wotfhsz not God,1}gt
