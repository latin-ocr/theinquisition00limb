, The same Person teaches, that no Covenants, Conventions or Laws aareC- 16, 17,
firm, that permit Hereticks to have or reform Churches, or to possess or ad· ¹3·
minister their Revenues 3 or by which the Proceffes of Churches against He-
reticks or Schismaticks, that are or may be moved in Judgtnent, are wholly

ut off, or suspended for a Time, or for ever ·, or finally, by which Hei-eticks
{nd Schismaticks are permitted to exercise any Jurisdifflon or Administration,
either by themselves or with Catholicks, or to enjoy any publick Offices.

Moreover‚ all Places of Refuge, which are open to Malefactors and the
worst 01 Villains, are denied to Hereticks, as tho’ they were the very Off„
scouring of the Earth, and had put off the very human Nature at the same
time they did the Roman Religion. Thus Simancas : “ An Heretick flying totis. 46·
“ a Churcb, shall not be protected by the Sanffity of the Place, i. e. the Irn- §- 65.
“ munity os the Churches. And therefore szdemir, King 01 the Golhs, who
“ granted this Immunity to the Churches of Spain more than 900 Years ago, Tit, 46³
“ excepted three Sorts ot Men from it, viz. Thieves, Traytors and Here— 5. 65.
“ ticks, as Peter Affedimz relates in his Life.

“ Simancas adds, That altho’ in almost all Crimes nobler Persons are subjeet (Ξ- 67²
“ to one sort of Puniffiment, and the meaner to another, yet in the Crime of
“ Heresy the same Punishment is appointed for all, without Respeaeft of Pera
“ sons. So that a noble Person falling into Heresy is infamous and vile, and
“ must suffer the Punishment due to the ine-inest. For there is no Difference in
“ Matters of Faith and Religion between the Great and the Small, the No-

“ ble and Ignoble. The Law of Honorius and Theodofius says, They are all ᾗ. 68,
“ equal to one another, who are equal in the Pravity os DoCtrine. And ano-

“ ther Law says, They who are alike defiled, and made equal by their

“ Wickedness, are equally subjeft to the same Punissiment, l. 49. tit. 4. lib. 16.

“ C.Theod. and l. 1,otit. 27. lib29.

Finally, they teach‚ that heretical Kings are to be deprived of their mog-
dorns for Heresy. Thus Simancas: “ ’Tis enquired whither the Kingdon1§.752
“³ of an heretica] King, who hath no Superior, can be confiscated? The Rea-

“ son of the Doubt arises from this, because the Goods ofHeretieks are for·

“ feited to the superior Lord. And therefore Alphonstzs Castrenfis is of Opi·

“ nion‚ That such Kingdom belongs to the Catholick Son of an heretical
“ King, in the same Manner as it would if the Heretick were dead. But is

“ the Son and next of Kin be also Hereticks, a Catholick Kingdom may. “
“ chuse themselves an Orthodox King. But if the Kingdom be hereric-al, the

‘⁶ Election osa Catholick King belongs to the chief Pontiffi'’ This Opinion

The fifth Punish'ment is Imprisonment. For altho’ by the Civil Law she Βτυῠυς,
Prison is only to detain Men, yet by the Canon Law it may be used as a 1⁵u5‘· 5- ὁ· ¹²’

sed or convi&, may either be delivered to the secular Court, or condeinred
to perpetual Imprisonment. In which Case the condemned Person lhall be

punilhed at the Option of the Judge· The
