Thus the Civil Magistrate was sometime forced to yield to the Papa! Au-
thority t And this undoubtedly was the Reason, that the Laws of Frederick
against Hereticks, were, as Friar Bernard of Como relates in his Light of the
Inquifitors, printed at Rome, An. 1584. register'd in the Records of the City
Coma, and accepted by the whole Council of that City, Sept. 10, 1255-
NeverthelesS, upon Account of the exceffive Cruelty of the Inquisitors‚ and
the Greatness of the Expence, the People were violently set against this Tri-
bunal ·, and some of the Popes could scarce extricare themselves out of these
Difficulties, till at length the People admitted it more easily, being eased ofthe
Expenses they had born to support the Inquisition, and because the Episcopal
Authority in that Tribunal was greatly enlarged.

Sometimes however they broke out into open Violence, which was with·
great Difficulty appeased. Thus it happen'd in the Country os Parma, as
Honorius IV. relates it, in his Letter to the Bishop of that City ³¹⁵, extant in
Bzovius. These Difficulties were indeed overcome by the Authority of the
Pope, and Rigour of Punishments ·‚ but contrary to the Inclinations and En-
deavours of the People, who cursed the Cruelty of the Inquisitors. From
some Countries where the Inquifition had been brought in, it was driven out
again3 because it assumed the Cognizance of those Affairs which did not
belong to it 3 so that the People could no longer bear the intolerable Yoke.
In these latter Ages, viz. An. 1518. the most violent Tumults were raised
in Bre2scz‘a, against the Inquifitors, who exercised the most outragious Cruel-
ties against some Persons accused of Magick, which were very difficultly

IV. the Prisons og the Pllhquifition were broke open pby the Mob at Rome 3
and the whole Building, with all its RecordS, burnt to the Ground. At
Mantua, An. 1568. there was, on the same Account, a violent Sedition,
which brought the City it self into the extreamest Danger.

As there occurred to these new Judges many Cases, not determined by the
Laws, so that sometimes they were in doubt how to proceed ; they referred'
them to the Pope, by whom they were deputed, who by his Rescripts‚ gave
them proper Direcstions, and declared how they were to pronounce in like
Cases. There are extant many such Answers of Innocent IV. Alexander IV.
Urban IV. and Clement IV. to the Inquifitors, instructing them in the Affair
of their Office against Hereticks. And although these Rescripts were
sent only to the Italian Inquifitors, yet we must not think, as Pegna remarks,
that these Decrees were to be observed in Italy only: ‘⁶ For the Roman Pon-

Difeff, 1⁷²⁶ “ tiffs transmitted their Rescripts to the Inquifitors of Italy ε because at that
