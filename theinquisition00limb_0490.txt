60 The HtsToRY os the INQUISITION.

cutes and condemns as Hereticks, or suspected of Heresy‚ doth, whatever he
may think in his Mind‚ seem by Facit to declare and profess, either that the
Church ought not to deprive such Persons ofBurial‚ or that it is lawsul to pray
for Hereticks and their Believers, &a because he buries thern aster the Man-
ner of CatholickS. Butwhether this Suspicion be only light, or vehement,
skilful Men must judge of according to the Qality of the Persons. The Pu-
nishment of such is Excomrnunication, from which they cannot be absolved
without proper Sittisfaetion, whether it be Abjuration or Canonical Purga-

tion. Nor can they merit the Benefit of Absolution, unless they unbury them ‘⁴

with their own Hands, and throw out the Bodies of such condemned Persons
from their Graves. Cap. Qticunq3 in prinC. de haeret. lib. 6.

The same Suspicion arises, if any one celebrates the Obsequies of such a
Person after the Manner os Catholicks, when such Heretick or suspected
Person dies any where else, at Geneva for Instance, or any other Place, where
Men live and believe heretically. And finally, if any one steals away and pre-
serves the Ashes, Bones, Garments or the like, of burned Hereticl<3.

But if any one finds an Heretick, or a Believer or Favourer of Heredeks,
or any such Person dead, in those Places in which he cannot easily accuse them
before the lawful Judges, then he may inter them, but not in holy Ground,
that so their unburied Bodies may not corrupt the Air ·, nor shall he hereby
deserve any Punishment, or contra& any Suspicion of Heresy. He must
however report the Affair to the Judges os the Faith, as soon as he can, that
they may appoint what is needful to be done.
