when they deliver over an Heretick to the secular Arm, beseech 'rt so to mode-
rate the Rigor ofthe Sentence, as not to endanger Life or Limb.

This was the Part that Calvin asted in the Affair of Servetus, which I have
represented in the most impartial Manner, as it appears to rne3 and am sorry 1
arn not able to wipe offso foul a Szain from the Memory of this otherwise cx·
cellent and learned Reformer. But when his Enemies charge him with afting
meerly from Principles of Malice and Revenge in this matter, 1 think it. an.
evident Abuse and Calumny. He was, in his own Judgment‚ for persecuting
and destroying Hereticks, as appears from the Treatise he published in Vindi-
cation of this Praelice, entitled e, A Declaration for maintaining the true Faz'th, held
by all Christians, concerning the ‘Trinity of Persons in One only G0d‚ by John Calvin,
against the detestable Errors of Michael Servetus, a Spaniard. In which ’tis al-
so proved, thet it is lawful to punish Heretick53 and that this Wretch was justly-
executed in the Citx¹ of Geneva. Geneva, 1554. This Principle was maintain-
ed by almost all‘the Fathers and Bishops of the Church fince the three first
Centuries, who esteemed Heresy as one of the worst of Impieties, and thought
it the Duty os the civil Magistrate to employ their Power for the Suppreffion
ofit,⁴ and sor the Support and Establishment of the orthodox Faith. And
though the first Reformers abhorred the Cruelty of the Papists towards the
,Protestants, they had nevertheless the same Abhorrenee of what theyzcounted
Heresy that the Papists had, and agreed with thern in the Lawfulness of sup-
preffing it by the civil Power. So that Calvin afted in this Affair from a PrIn-
c1ple, thongh a mistaken Principle os Conscience‚ and had the Encouragement
and Approbation os the rnost learned and pious Reformers of the Times he
lived in. Melantton, in a Letter to Bullinger, says, I have read also what you
have written concerning the Blasphemies of Servetus, and I approve your Piety and
Judgment. I think also, that the Senate of Geneva hath done right, that they have

that there are any who disapprove that Severity. He affirms the same also in another‘
,Letter to Cal-vin himself. Bucer also said publickly in his Sermon, that he
caught to have his Bowels pulled out, and be torn in pieces, as Calvin relates it in·
his Letter to Sultzer. Farrel in a Letter to Calvin says, that he deserved to die
len Thouiond Dentes, that it would be a Piece of Cruelty, and an Injustice to Christ,
aud the Domine of Piety, for Magistrates not to take notice of the horrible Blasphe-
mics of that wicked Heretick. And he hoped God would so order it, that as the Ma·
