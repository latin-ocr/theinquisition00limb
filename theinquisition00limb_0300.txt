132 The Hmromf ofthe INQUISITION.

“ great his Zeal was to maintain the Faith in its ancient Splendor, his intro-
“ ducing the sacred Tribunal os the Inquisitors of Heresy into Portugal‚ is
“ an abundant Proof, bravely over-coming those Difficulties and Obstru-
“ ctions, which the Devil had cunningly raised in the City, to prevent or
“ retard his Maiesty's Endeavours. For he learnt Experience from others,
‘⁶ and grew wife by the Misfortunes os many Kingsfioms, which from the·
“ most flourilhing State were brought to Ruin and Destruffion by monstrous
‘⁶ and deadly Herefies. And it is very worthy Observation, that the Year in.
“ which the Tribunal of the holy Inquifition against heretical Pravity was
‘⁶ brought into Portugal, the Kingdom laboured under the most dreadful
“ Barrenness and Famine. But when the Tribunal was once ere&ed‚ the
“ following Year was remarkable for an incredible Plenty, commonly called
‘⁴ the Year ofSt. Blase, because, before his Festival, which was on the third
‘⁶ of the Nones of February, the Seed could not be sown in the Ground for
“ want of Rain, whereas afterwards Provifion was so very cheap, that a
“ Bushel of Corn sold for Two-pence.''
By what Means King John ΙΙΙ. brought this Tribunal into Portugal, he no
a. 1535· where tells us. Only he gives us a Bull of PaulIII. beginning, Illius vices in

§- 33· terris. By which he approves of the Absolution and Indulgencies granted by
his Predeceffor Clement VII. to such as were already converted, in order to

draw over the Heretieks and Unbelievers of the Kingdoms of Portugal· and
Algarve, to the true Faith. In this Bull it is related, that Clement VII. de-
puted Didacus de Silva, a Minim Friar, Profeffor of St. Francis de Paula, to
be his and the Apostolick Sees Commiffary, and Inquisitor over the new
Christians, returning to the Jewifh Rites they had forsaken, and all others
embracing Errors and Herefies, in the Kingdom and Dominions aforesaid,
with full Power to make Inquifition against all who were guilty, or suspeeted
os these Crimes, and to imprison, corrrect and punish them 3 and that after·
wards, for certain reasonable Causes‚ he suspends, by other Letters, during
his Pleasure, the aforesaid, and all other his Letters whatsoever, and all
Faculties and Commiffions granted in the Premiffes by the said Letters, to the
said Didacus, and all Ordinaries of Places whatsoever, and by Friar Mark Bishop
of Sezzogaglz'a, Nuncio of the Apostolick See to the King of Portugczl‚ acquaints
Didacus and the aforesaid Ordinaries, and the other Inquisitors in those Paris, of
these last Letters. Afterwards there is a long Detail of the Favours granted by
Clement VII. his Predeceffor, ’το the new Converts, or the Descendants of the
Jewz'fh Converts, all which he approves and confirms, decreeing that all
such Persons, though imprifoned, and their Crimes notorioussy proved in
their Trials, and they themselves condemned as Hereticks, shall be forgiven
all the Punishments they were condemned to as such before the Date of the
said Letters-, that they shall not be obliged to confess, abjure or renounce ·,‹
that they shall be freed from their Goals, Banishrnents and Banns 3 that they
shall enjoy all Privileges and Favours, which are enjoyed by any other of the
FaithfulosChrist, their Children, and Grand-children, and that they shall
not be under any Mark of Incapacity and Infamy ς he makes void, cancels‚
