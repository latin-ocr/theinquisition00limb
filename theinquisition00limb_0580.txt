’ knows 111 what Prisons heis detained? and upon what Account Men are im-
pris'oncd there? Ishe says he can't guess at the Cause os his Iinp'risotiinent, but
knows that he is in‘the Prisons ofthe holy Office, where Hereticks and Per-
sons suspe&ed of Heresy are confused, he is told, that since he knows Persons
are confined there sor their Profanation of Religion, 116 ought to conclude
that he also is confined for the same Reason, and must therefore declare what
he believes to be the Cause of his own Apprehension and Confinement in the
l'risons of the holy Office. If he says he cannot imagine what it should be,
before he is asked any other Qestions, he receives a gentle Admonition, andv
is put in mind of the Lenity of the holy Office towards those who confess
v-:ishout forcing, and of the Rigour ofJustice used towards those who are ob-
stinate. They also compare other Tribunals with the holy Office, and re-
mind him, that in others the Confeffion of the Crime draws‘ after it immedi-
ate Execution and Punishment3 but thatin the Court of the Inquisition‚
those who confess, and are penitent‚ are treated with greater Gentleness. Af-
ter this he is admonished in Writing, and told, that the Ministers of the ho-
ly Office never take up any one, or are used to apprehend any one without a
just Cause, and that therefore they earnestly beseech him, and command and
enjoin him exac'tly to recolleet and diligently to consider his Astions, to ex-
amine his Conscience, and purge it from all those Offences and Errors it la-
bours under, and for which he is informed against.

After [1115116 15 asked, what Race he comes os? Who were his Parents
and Ancestors? that hereby he may declare all his Family. Whether any
one of them was at any time taken up by the holy Office, and enjoined Pe·
nance? This they are especially asked who descend from Jews, Mahometans‚
and Sedlaries. where he was brought up? In what Places he hath dwelt?
Whether he ever changed his Country ? Why he did so, and went into ano·
ther Place? With whom he conversed in the aforesaid Places, who were his
Friends‚ and with whom he was intimate? Whether he ever conversed with
any of 1115 Aequaintance about Matters of Religion, or heard them speak a·
bout Religion? In what Place, and when, and how often, and of what
Things or Matters they conversed ? They particularly ask these Questions of
Persons whom they imagine to be crafty and cunning, and not easily
brought to declare the Truth, that from their Kindred, Country, Edu-
cation, Employment, Time past, Acquaintance, Friendship, Behaviour and
VVords‚ the Inquifitor may draw strong Arguments of Suspicion. These
Qestions are especially asked, when such Criminals are examined, who have
dweltin the Countries of Schismaticks, Hereticks, and other infidel and er·
roneous Persons, because, when they have dwelt a long while amongst such
Persons, they are believed the more easily to have followed their Praffices.

He is moreover asked, of what Profeffion he is, and what Employment
of Life he follows? Whether he be rich or poor? What Returns he bath,
and what the Expences of 1115 Living ? Then he is commanded to give an Ac·
count of his Life, and to declare what he hath done from his Childhood‚
even to this Time. And that he may declare all this, he is asked, in what

Places
