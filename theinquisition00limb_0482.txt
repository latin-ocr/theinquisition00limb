eight, whom they would call by Name that Day or the following, whom,
as the principal Offenders, they would enjoin wholesome Penance 3 and they
oblige the whole Univerfity‚ and every Person thereos, that they and every
one of them shall satisfy the Bishop and Church of Viviers‚ as also the Office
of the Inquifition and the Inquifitors, and all Persons belonging to them, and
pay the Expences they have been at upon account of the said Affair.

In the same Book of Sentences there are two other Instances of Inquifition
made against private Persons for hindring the Office of the Inquisition.

The first is that of Friar Bernard Deliciofi, who was accused, that, as the
principal Diwfior, he had prosecuted the Complaints of the Cities of Carcaffin,
Viviers, and cordes, having procured for this Purpose a large Sum of Money
from the said Places, and by the Sale of his Books, and by Borrowing ·‚ that
he had spoken very freely of the Processes and Sentences of the Inquifitors
publissied against certain Persons sor Heresy, in the most publick Conversatiom
and elsewhere, even in the secular Courts ·, that he had justified Persons appre-
hended ancl condemned for Heresy, and said, That though they were true Catho-
lieks, they were forced by the Violence of their Tortures to confess themselves and others
guilty of Heresy, and that they were unjustly condemned3 and hereby excited the
Magistrates and People to oppose the Bishop and Inquisitors: That he also
publickly asserted at Tholouse‚ That St. Peter and St. Paul could not defend them-
selves from Heresy if they were alive, and had Inquisition made against them in the
Affamzer praffistd by the Inquifitors, and that he thus informed the King of Franee
against the said lnquifitors: That he falsely ascribed to the Inquifitors an In·
strument drawn up against the City of Carcaſjbne upon the Affair of Heresy,
ancl made this an Argument of exciting the People, that they might see what
these Predicants would be able to do against particular Person3, who could
make so false and pernicious an Instrument against a whole Community:
T hat by this Means he hindred the Office of the Inquifition, raised a Sedition
and Rebellion‚ and did many other Things‚ by which the Exercise of the
Office of the Inquisition was obstructed ε That moreover, after having taken
the Advice os many Persons‚ at several Times, and in different Places, he
had been deputed by the Magistrates of Carcaſjbne, to the Lord Ferrand
de Majoricis, and had offered to him the Borough of Carcaffime in these
Words. “ My Lord, you may know that the Magistrates of Carcaffime, upon
“ account ofthe Disturbances raised by the Inquisitors, and because the King
“ of France will not take Care to protect them from· the Αέῖἰοηε of the lnqui-
“ fitors according to their Defire, are willing to receive you for their Lord
“ and Defender, and will receive you, if, and whensoe-ver you will please to
“ come, and deliver up to you the Borough of Carcaſjbne, &c.’' And that
the Lord Ferrcmd answered, that he would willingly accept what they offered
him by the said Friar. And finally, he was accused ofMagick, and that he
had by him, and read a certain conjuring Book: That hereby he incurred
the Sentence of Excommunication, and with an obstinate Mind continued under
it for fifteen Years, and at the same time celebrated divine Services: That
