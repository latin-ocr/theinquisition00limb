The second is, to give a Copy of the Process to the Person accused, and in
another Paper the Names of the Deponents, mixing with them the Names of
some other Persons, who have never deposed against him in that Affair, that
so he may objeci. against this and the other, and yet never know who hath de-
posed against him. But these ways are greatly disapproved of, and but seldom
praCtised, because they can’t be ofmuch Service to him that is accused, be-
cause he can’t hereby know who deposed this and the other Thing against him 3
and may be greatly hurtful to the Accusers; because the Paper it 1611 makes
it certain that the Criminal is accused by some one of them, and being un·
certain by whom, he may form a Resolution against those wholhave never de-
posed against him, or whose Depofitions against him are true, or who-have
deposed in his Favour. And thus he may lay Snares for them, and< bring
them into very great Danger, which they> carefully provide against.-

The third WVay is, that the Person accused is interrogated when heis ex*
amined, at the End of his Confeffion, and before the Copy of the Process is
granted him, whether 116 remembers that he hath any mortal Enemies, who,
laying assde. the Fear of God, may charge him falsely with heretical Pravity ς
10 that without farther thinking, and before he sees the Depofitions of the
Witneffes, he may answer either that he 610111τ not remember that he hath any
111611 Enemies, or that if he doth call any such to mind, he may name⁴ them
as they occur to him. ’ ’

Ifhe says he hath no such Enemies, the Inquisitor may charge him to think

ofit, and to write down their Names if he remembers any, and thus described,-
to exhibit- them to the Judge with the Notary and Witnesses. The Judge must
cause ali‘these Things to be inserted in the Acts, viz. that such a one, &a
appeared such aDay, &a before the Inquifitor, &aa and gave in a certain
written Paper, containing as underwritten, which must? be inserted at length.
After which the Judge gives him his Oath‚ and asks him whether that be his
“Writing‚ and written with his own Hand? Likewise, whether he affirms
that all and singular the Matters contained in it are true ? Likewise, whether
all and singular the Persons, there described by Name, are his mortal Ene-
:mies ἓ Likewise, concerning the Time, Rise, Cause or Occasion of the En-
mity? Likewise, whether belides the before-named, he hath any other Ene-
mie-s, and whom, and what the Cause and Time of the Enmity? Again,
whether after such Enmity contracted or arisen, he hath evermade use of
them as Evidences for him in any Civil or Criminal Cause? To these other Inp-
terrogatories may be added at Pleasure, as the prudent Judge shall think
proper, from the Answers given to the Premises, and other reasonable Circum-
stance83 which being well considered, and diligently examined, it will be easy
‘to discover whether the Enmity pretended be real or not. But even here ·v
they areparticularly cautious, that whilst they are thinking of Methods to
find out· the E‘nmity of the Vrsitneffes, the Criminals may not come to the
Knowledge of them„ These Things almost agree with the Words of the lai--
flaopof Albam, in which he prescribeawhat the Inquifitorsmust do in such a„
