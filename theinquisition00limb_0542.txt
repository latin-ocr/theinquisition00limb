If any-³ do, or have hindred the Office of the holy Inquisttion, or do, or have in-

Hereticks, which treat of Religion, without Authority of the holy Apostolick See, or who
have or do read, print, or cause them to be printed, or defend them, under any Pre-
tence or Colour, or Books of Necromancy‚ Magick, or containing sorcerous Incanta·
tions and the like Superstitions, especially if with the Abufi’of sacred Things.

Declaring, thal tho' we do expreſsly specify as above the C aſses which ought to be dist
covered, we do not exclude other Cast’s relating to the holy Offiee, which are always
contained in the fhcred Canons, Decrees, Constantiam, and Bulls of the chief
Ponti, s.

Arldsthat no one can be absblved from the aforesaid Excommunication and Penal-
ties, which the Disobedient incur, but by us or the supream Tribunal of the Inquifition
at Rome, nor shall be absolved, unless he shall first give Satisfafiiom by juridically
revealing the said Heretieks, or as above, those suspeblea' of Herefy.

And because much of the Service of God, and the private and publick Good, in
these Particzu'ars, greatly depends upon the Endeavours of the Confiffors, we com·
mand all the reverend Confcffors, that in the Administration of the Sacrament of Pe-
nance, they nse all that Diligence in interrogating those who confess to them, concerning
all the eforcfizid Heads, which they shall think respectively neciffary, both as to thosis
wlff) are prjncipal Offenders, and those who are Partakers of, and any ways consci-
ous to those Offences. And we command the said Confeffors, under the said Penalty of
Excomnznnication, latae sententiae, and as above, that they do not pre’fhme to ab·
solve those whom they shall find to have offended, or to be Partakers, or conscious, as
above, in the aforesaid Particulars, because they have incurred those Censures which
are reserved by the holy See, to its Delegates.

Admonishing, that such Persons do not satisfy, nor are understood to satisfy theſse
our Commands, who pretend to discover Delinquents by Papers or Letters without the
Name or Sirname of the Authors, or by any other uncertain Method, because they
may be absolutely secure, that they shall not be discovered, according to the Custom
of this holy Office, and do not lay themselves under a Neccffity of proving what they
declare.

And that this our present general Edil't' may be known to all, and no one pretend
Ignorance, we command all the reverend Arch-Presbyters, Carales and Rectors of
Churches, subjet't to our Jurisdietion, or their Vicars, in Virtue of their holy Obedi-
enee, under Pain of Exconzinunication, that the first Holyday after they receive it,
they shall be absolutely obliged to publish, read, or caufi’ it to be read, at length, be-
fore the People, when they shall be met together in largest Numbers in their said
Churches‚ and when published, cause it to be fixed up upon the principal Gate of
the said Chnrches, or some other publick Place, where it may be seen and read of
all ; and this also we enjoin all the Priors of Monasteries.

Farther, 'tis our Pleasure, that under the same Penalties they shall be obliged to
read it again before the said People‚ twice at least in a Year, viz. upon one Sun-
day in Lem, and one in Advent-
