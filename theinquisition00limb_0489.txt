The HlsTORY ofthe ΙΝρυιεΙΤιοΝ. 59

As if any one should argue thus: He is found to frequent private Conventi-
cles, and in his Life· and Manners departs from the common Conversation of
the Faithful 3 therefore he is an Heretick, because Hereticks themselves are
found to do such Things frequently. Such are lightly suspected of Heresy,
But the Inquifitors teach, that such Persons ought not easily to be proceeded
against in a Cause of such Importance. However, sometimes the very speak-
ffsses‘fflessssssffl‘ss‘l‘ ‘322522112235323210‘13§nimos ἒξ ὴὲῖῑῑέῑευὲῖῂῑ·

reme, incurred the Canon, because, whilst he dwelt in France, he conversed
with Hereticks. For 'twaS, they thought, a Crime for any one so much as
to salute them, contrary to the Apostolick Institutions. But as he was af-
terwards absolved by Rdymond Peniafortius‚ Penitentiary of the Apostolick
See, Pope Gregory enjoin’d the Prior, and Friar Rohert, and the rest of the
Predicant F riars in Poris, that they Ihould not any ways molest him, or suffer
or command him to be molested.

A vehement Suspicion, which is also called Juris, arises from such externa}
Words and Deeds, which, when known, infer an Argument frequently con-
clufive3 and because, as to most, he'who doth or says such Things is an He‹
retick3 and is usually taken for full Proof, if there be nothing proved to the
contrary. Such are those, who being called to answer concerning the Faith,

, do not appear in the Time afligned them ·, such who knowingly hindei· the

 

 

Office of the Inquifition 3 who knowingly give their Counsel and Affistance

and F avour to such Hinderers 3 who instruet Hereticks when cited to conceal

the Truth, and speak falsely3 who are any ways excommunicated upon Ac-

, count of the Faith 3 who knowingly favour, defend, and receive Hereticks 3

who are infamous for Heresy, upon account of their Familiarity with such

¹ whom they know to be Hereticks 3 who knowingly accompany, vifit and re-

ceive Hereticks. He also who gives a Kiss to an Heretick is vehemenrly to

be suspe&ed of Heresy, according to the Judgment of the Synod offerragone,

according to this Decree: [t is likewise enquired .· Whether he who gave a Kiss

to one of the Inzabbatati, or an Heretick‚ when he believed and knew him to he

such a Person, or prayed with him, or concealed him, or heard preachz'ng or reading

from him, and believed him to he a good Man, is to bejudged of as a Belle-ver of

his Errors ? And wesay that he is not. However, let such an one be condemned as a

Fovourer, or Concealer, and Benefcfflor, and vehemenllysszſjoeffecl to believe his Er«

And this we think proper to leave to the Pleasure os the prudent Judge„ Belides

these, such also are vehemently suspefted, who arejudicially convifted os Per-

jury, or a Lye, in a Cause of the Faith, and who have often done or said any

thing against the Faith, and the like, for all the particular Cases cannot be enu-

merated. They who do such Things are said to be vehemently suspected.
Amongst these are reckoned also, such who knowingly give Ecclesiastical D.·'ref1¹.p.3,
