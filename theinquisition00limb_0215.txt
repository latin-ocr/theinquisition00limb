The H1sTonv ofthe INQUISITION. 47

‘³‘ rors and Herefies thou hast been frequently admonished, and exhorted by.
“ Reasons and Authorities of holy Scripture, and besought by sweet VVords in
“ the Lord, as well by me the aforesaid Inquifitor, and the Vicars, as by many
“ religious Persons, Predicants and Minors, and other Orders, and by other
‘⁶ good Men of the Clergy and Laity in the City of Tholoufh, and even by
‘⁶ thy own Parents, that thou would'st forsake the aforesaid Errors, and
‘⁶ with a good and pure Heart would'st return to holy Mother the Church
‘⁴ of Rome, without which there is no Salvation, and wouldst abandon that
‘⁶ detestible heretica] Sect, which leads Souls to Damnation, and infernal De-
“ struffion. But thou would'st not hitherto acquiesce, nor, tho’ long waited
“ for, be converted to the Catholick Faith, but even yet perseverest in thy
‘⁶ said Obstinacy with an harden’d Mind. Therefore with the Advice os good
“ Men, skilful in the Canon and Civil Law, and of many religious Persons,
“that such a scabbed Sheep may not infe& the found Sheep of the Lord’s
‘⁶ Flock, having God before our Eyes, and not being able to bear such
‘⁶ Blasphemy and Scandal to the Faith, and the Name of our Lord Jens
‘⁶ Christ, and having peremptorily assigned to thee this present Day, to hear
‘⁶ thy definitive Sentence, and laying the holy Gospel before us, we do ad-
“ judge thee to be an. Heretick‚ and as such leave thee to the secular
⁵⁶ Court.

These Opinions of the. Albigenses are not one of them ascrib’d to the Valdenfhs,
who had quite different TenetS, which are never mentioned in the Sentences of
the Albigenfi’s. They are such as these:

That all Judgment is forbidden by God, and that of Conſs’quence 'tis a Sin, and fol.9<5‚
contrary to what God hath forbidden, for any Judge to condemn any Man to Punishe
ment or Death, in any Case, or for any Causa whatsoever. And for this they apply
iheste Words of the Gospel, Jndge not that ye be not juclged.

That the Indulgences given by the Prolatos of the Church of Rome are of no avail ; fd, 95-
‘That there is no Purgatory for Souls after this Life ς · and that the Prayors and
Vows of the Faithful for the Dead cannot profit them. This is elsewhere more
distinffly explained: ‘T hat this Life is the only Purgatory and Place for Repen- fol. 92⁹
tance for. Sins ς and that when the Soul goes from the Bady, it goes efther to Pa-

l radise or Hell ·, and that therefors³ the Valdenses make no Prayers- or· Vows for the

Dead, becaufh, say they, those who are in Paradise do not need them, and thofh thaz?
are in Hell cannot νεαρ any Advantage by thern.
‘shat in the C‘wrch there are hut three Orders, viz, of Bifhops, Pricsts, andfhl.146.b.

ἵ Deacons. It is imputed to them also as a Crime, that tho? they were Laymen,fhl.128.b·

they preached from the Gospels, Epistles, and other Books of the holy Scrip-
tures ·, whereas the Preaching and Expofition of the Scripture is entirely fora
bidden the Laity. All these Things will appear more plain from a Sentence

passed on one of the Valdenses, which I shall here insert, out of the Book of the
Sentences of the Tholoufi’ Inqu. fol. 128.
