and remits the whole Affair to the Pope, and affigns to the Appellant a cer-
tain Term, within which he must appear at the Court of Rome before the
Pope, with the Process‘es inclosed and sealed up, to be delivered to him by
the Inquifitor, upon giving good Security‚ or under a safe and stri& Guard.
This is the Answer he gives to him, who appeals for affirmative Letters,
which he commands to beimmediately inserted after the Appeal put in, and
thus delivers it to the Notary who presented it.

If the Inquifitor gives the Appellant negative Letters, he continues his Pro-
cess against him, to let him know, that he doth not cease to be his Judge, till
he is prohibited to proceed by that Judge to whom the Appeal is made. But
yet from the Hour of the Appeal, he can do nothing new against the Appellant,
till he hath delivered to him the negative Letters. But if he grants him affir-
mative or reverential Letters, he immediately ceases to be his Judge, and can
take no farther Cognizance of the Cause, unless it be remitted to him by the
Pope. He may however proceed against the Appellant in any other Cause,
viz. if after having given him such Letters of Reverence, he is informed against
before the Inquifitor for other Herefies and Crimes.

But now the inferior Inquifitors are not allowed to use this Power. In Spain
the Madrid Instruffion, An. 1561. c. 51. gives this Caution in the Affair. If
the Inquisttors think that an Appeal is to be allowed in any Case, in the criminal Cau-
Jes of such Criminals as are imprifimed, they must send the Proceffes to the Senate of
the anuzfitz'on, without certifying the Criminals themselves of it, and with such Cau-
tion and Secresy, that no one without the Priſsm may know it; because, if the Senate
should think otherwise in any particular Cause, it may give Order, and take the ne-
cffzry Care about it. But in other Provinces, and especially in Italy, where
the Appeal is admitted, the Inquisitors consult the Senate of the general Ro-
man Inquifition for the whole Christian Common-wealth, the Cause being
briefly and summarily reported to them3 and if the Senate thinks fit that the
Criminals should be sent to Rome, it must be done, and the Inquifitors must
send them there under good Security and safe Custody.

How they proceed agaiJssfitch who make their Efiape.

Direff. H U S have we given an Account of the.Method of proceeding against
&QUO-T a Criminal adtually in Jayl. But if he absent, or hath made his E-
aem. 33· stape, the Proccss is formed against him after this manner. When any one
is informe-:d against before the Inquifitor for being infested with Heresy, and
such Person is not present in the Place where the Inquifitor lives, but dwells
in some other Place, within the Bounds of the Inquifitor's Jurisdistion, he is

said to be absent, but not a F ugitive⁸ When there is any Apprehenfion §f
