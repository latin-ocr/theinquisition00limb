The Hrsroa’c of the INquslrroN.

At length, after their Doftrine had prevailed near forty Years in Lombardy,
Sagca·‘elli was condemned as an Arch·heretick by the Bishop of Parma, and
Friar Manfred the Inquisitor, a Predicant, in the Time of Bonz'face VIlI. and
burnt July the 18th, A. D. 1300. Dulcinus‚ with six thousand of his Followers
of both Sexes, inhabited the Alps, who run into all manner of Luxury, as

· Pegna says, and gained many Proselytes for the Space of two or three Years;
m. and that with such Success, as determined Clement V. to send amongst them

Inquisitors of the Predicant Order, to put a Stop to so great an Evil, either
by recovering Dulcinus and his Accomplices from their Error, or by acquaint-
ing him whether these Things were so or not, as he had been credibly inform’d,
after they had made a stri& and diligent Enquiry. Upon their Return they
reported to the Pontiff what they had seen and heard, who upon being ac..
quainted with their horrid Wickedneffes and Impurities, published a Crusado
against so heinous an Impiety‚ and promised large and liberal Indulgences to
all who ssiould engage in so pious a War against such wicked Men. An Army
was accordingly gathered, and sent against thern with an Apostolick Legate ς
who coming, into the Places where these false Apostles dwelt, and unexpect-
edly attacking them, they were wholly oppreffed by this Catholick Army of
Cross-bearers, partly by Hunger and Cold, and partly by Arms. Dulcinus
himself was taken, and eight Years after the Punishment of Geraldus‚ was,
as an Arch-heretick, with Margaret his heretical wife, his Partner in Wick-
edness and Error, publickly torn in Pieces‚ and afterwards burnt. The Opi-
nions which Eymerick attributes to them agree for the most Part with those
which are ascribed to Peter Lucensts‚ aSpaniard, excepting that abominable
Principle of promiscuous Lust, of which there is not the least mention in
the Sentence of the said Peter. From whence we may certainly conclude,
that this is a mere Calumny upon these Apostolicks, as well as upon the Val-

The Sentence of this Peter Lucensis is as follows„ -

“ Peter Lucenfis‚ of the City of Lago, in theProvince of GaHicia, beyond
“ Compostella, the Son of Vivian of the City ofLug0‚ as legally appears by his
‘⁶ judicial Confessiom harh acknowledged‚ that twenty Years since he began
⁸ ⁶ to observe that Order and Life which is called the Life of the Apostles in the
‘⁶ Poverty of the Gospel, and hath observed it with all his Power, as far as
‘⁶ his Frailty would allow him, ever since he was first infor-med by Richard
‘⁶ Lombard of Alexandria, who observed the said Life and Order, altho' the
‘² said Peter had heard it reported and did believe that the Church of Rome had
“ condemned and disallowed the Order of those Apostles, and did believe that=
“ such Apostles were condemned and persecuted by the Prelates and Reii-
