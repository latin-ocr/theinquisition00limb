“ pronounced sometimes against a Person, viz. a Community or Chapter.
“ Sometimes against a Place‚ viz. a Church or City. And there is this Dif-

the Churches be stripped, as in Easter Eve, and the Croſjes and Ornaments be
taken away, as a Token of Mourning and Sadness to all. Let the Altars be adorned
at thoſse Maſjes only, which any of the Priests shall stzy, the Church Doors being shut ;
and when the Maffi’s are done, let them be stript again. Let no one marry during
