The HISTORY of the INQU181T10n,

Sighs and Groans we must attain to a small Eortion of the Knowledge of God. Lastly,
they mge against you, who are not deceived with that Error, into which they βε you are

fallen. But as for my fielf, I, who after long and great Fluttuation, can at las}

perceive, what is that Sincerity which is free from all Mixture of vain Fable, cannjst

by any Means rage against you, whom I ought to bear with, as I was once borne with
my fhff, and to treat you with the ‚scente Patience that my Friends exercissd towards
me, when I was a zealous and blind Espouser of your Error.

And again, in his Qestions upon St. Matthew’s Gospel, chap. 12. when the
good Corn sprung up and brought forth Fruit, then appear'd the Tares also :
For when the spiritual Man begins to difiern all Things, he begins to discern Errors„
His Servants said to him, Wilt thou that we go and gather the Tares? Are
we to ficppost’ that those are the Servatus, whom he calls a little after Reapers‚ which
in the Expofition of the Parable he expressy saith to be Angels ἕ But who will dare af·
firm, that the Angels knew not who sowed the sares, and then first discerned them,
when they perceived the Fruit come forth ? We ought rather to interpret it of faithful
Men here, fignified hythe Name ofServants‚ whom he also calls the good Seed. Nor
is it any Wonder that the same Persons should be called the good Seed, and the Servants
of the Master, stnce Christ says ofhimselfi that heis the Gaze, and the Shepherd 3 -
for the same ‘Ihing is represented under many different Similitudes for different Rea-
ans ; and the rather here, because when he speaks to the Servants, he clo-th not say, γ
When the Harvest comes, 1³will say to you, Gather first the Tares :⁷ But I*-
will speak, says he, to thevReaperse From whence we may infer, . that the gather- -
ing the ‘Tares to burn them is the Bufineſs of others, and that no Son of the C hurch should
imagine that 'tis an Office belonging to him. When therefore any Person begins to bespi-
ritual, he perceives-the Errors of the Hereticks, and judges and discerns every thing
that he reads or hears to differ from the Rule of Truth. But until he grows more
perfeb‘t in these spiritual Things, and ripens into Fruit as the Seed did, he may be
fiirprized how so many Falshoods of the Hereticks should exist under the Christian ’
Name. Hence it was that the Servants said, Didst thou not sow good Seed in
this F ield ? Whence then the Tares? When at last he comes to {leno-w, that this*
is owing to the Suhtlety of the Devil‚,who, far from being awed by the Authority
of fi> great a Name, covers his own Falshoocls under it, he may have an Inclination
to destroy such I'Aen out of the World5 according as he hath Opportunity‚ . But whe-
ther he ought to do this, γ and whether it be the Duty of Men, he consults the Justice of
God, whether he hath commanded or permits it ? Hence the Servants said, Wilt
thou thatwe go and gather them ? To which the T ruth it self answerea’: The
Condition ofMan in this Life is not such, that it can certainly be known, what that
Min may afterwards-prove, who is now seen to be in a manifhst.Error 3 . or how his
Error may contribute to the Increase of the Good. And therefore stcch are not to be
destroyed, list whilst we endeavour to kill the evil, we kill also the good, or fiich as
Pffbly may hereafter prove so 3 and lest we hereby prejudice the good, to whom the
other may be, tho’ unwillingly‚ useful. But the most proper Time for this is, at
the End of all Thing5‚ when there will he no farther Opportunity of amending the
Life, or of advancing in the T ruth, by the Occaston and Comparison of other Mens

Errors. And even then this is to be done not by Men, hut by the Angels. Hencic}
