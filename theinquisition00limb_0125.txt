a'm afraid, that bath but little Probability or Truth to support it. For ivhat harh
Religion to do with the Observation of Days ? or, &Vliat could excite sz'or to
excommunicate so many Churches about Easter, but the Pride of his Hem-t,
and to let the World see, how large a Power he had to send Souls to the Devil ?
How is the Honour of God promoted‚ by Speculations that have no Ten-
dency to Godliness? Will any Man serioussy affirm, that the ancient
Disputes about υποςασις, faveatur, ιᾹἺοἹηἹΞς, eumq, ομσκσιος, ομοιὶςσιος, and the rest Of
the hard Words that were invented, did any Hononr to the Name of
Christ, or were of any Advantage to the Religion of his Gospel ? Or, can
he believe that Alexander, Arius, Athanasius, lllacedonim, and others, were
influenced in all their Contentions and Qiarrels, in all the Confusions they
were the Authors of, and the Murders they occasioned, purely by religione
hiotives? Surely the Honour of Religion must be promoted by other Menos ς
and genuine Christianity may flourish, and, indeed, would have flonrissz'tl
much better, had these Disputes never been introduced into the Cnurc'n;
or, had they been managed with Moderation and Forbearance. But such
was the Haughtiness of the Clergy, such their Thirst of Dominion over the
Consciences of others, such their Impatience of Contradifiion, that nothing
would content thern but implicit Faith to their Creeds, absolute Subjeffion
to their Decree5‚ and Subscription to their Articles without Examination or
Conviction of their Truth3 or for want of these, Anathemas, Depofizffins,
Banishrnents and Death.

⁷ The History of all the Councils‚ and of almost all the Bishops that is left
us, is a Demonstration of this sad Truth. What Council can be named, that
did not affume a Power to explain, amend, settle, and determine the Faith ?
That did not anathematise and depose those who could not agree to their Deciti-
οὓς, and that did not excite the Emperors to oppress and destroy them? W'as
this the Humility and Condescention of Servants and Ministers? KVas not
this lording it over the Heritage of God, seating themselves in the Throne
of the Son of God, and making themselves owned as Euhers and Masters, in
Oppofition to the express Command of Christ to the contrary ?

Clemens Romanus, in his first Epistle to the Corinthiam, Cap. 44. tells us‚Apud Co-
Thac ’κ the Apostles knew, by the Lord Jesus Christ, that the Episcopal Name αηᾶῑΕῙχΡ-Πέ·

says the learned Fell, in his Remarks on the Place, of the prophetick Spirit ofthe ⁰
Apostolick Age. Formerly‚ he adds, that Mens Ambition and evil Praflices to ob -
rain this Dignity, produced Sch1sms and Hefey‘ies. And 'twas indeed no Wonder
that such Disorders and Confusions should be occasioned, when the Bi-
›ssiopricks were certain Steps‚ not only to Power and Dominion, but to the
Emoluments and Advantages of Riches and Honours. Even long before the
Time of constamine, the Clergy had got a very great Ascendant over the
