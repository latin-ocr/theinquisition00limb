And this concludes the whole Aer, and was formerly the Manner of holding
a Sermon of the Faith.

Now let us see how all Things are put in Execution at this time in Spain
and Portugal, aster the A& of Faith.

which the Sentences are pronounced against them, and the Day following
are brought to an Audience of the Inquifitors, and are admonifhed of those
Things which are injoined them by their Sentences, and how grievoussy they
will be punished, unless they humbly do the Penances affign’d them. After
this, they send every one to the Place to which his Sentence ordered him.
Those who are condemned to the Gallies, are sent to the Jayls os the secular*
Judges. Some are whipped thr0'' the principal Streets of the City‚ and
sometimes receive two hundred Lassies. Others wear the infamous Sambenito,
some every Day, others must appear in them only Sundays and Holydays³
But in these Things every one observes the Custom of his own Inquifition. I'n
the Inquisition at Goa this is the Method. Before the Prisoners are dismissed,
they are carried from Jayl to some other House, where they are every Day in'-
struited in the Doctrines and Rites os the Church of Rome, and when they
are dismissed, every one hath a Writing given him, containing the Penances
injoincd them 3 to which is added a Command, that every one shall exaffl'y
keep secret every Thing he hath seen, said'or heard, and all the Transaffions
relating to him, whether at the Table, or in other Places os the 'noly Office.
And to this Secresy every Prisoner binds himself by asolemn Oath.

The Day after this Solemnity also, the Effigies of those condemned vtov
Death, painted to the Life, are carried to the Dominicans Church, and there
hung up to be viewedby all. The Custom in this Matter is described by Lu-
dovz'czts a Paramo. ‘⁶ There is another Monument of Infamy, which, tho’
vulgarly called by the Spaniards, Samhenito, yet is not„ a Garment‚ but a

· “ Cloath affixed to the Walls of the Churches for. perpetual Infamy in the

“ Parishes where they lived. On this Cloath is written the Nameand Sur-
“ name of the Criminal, and the Bufiness he carried on is also exprefled.
“ Ifhe discovers any sarther, they add another little Piece to the Cloath to

“ prevent Doubt‚ describrng his Country, and ostentimes also the Parents and
‘⁶ Grandfathers of the condemned Person.

“ In some os these Cloaths may be read‚,wh0 were the Parents of the Crimi-
“ nals, of what Race they were, whether they were married, or if married
‘¹‘ Women, whose Wives they were, whether lately recovered to the Chri-
“ stian Religion from the Jewifh Law and Mahometan seer. Finally, the
“· Cause of their Penance is declared according to the Nature of their Crime,
“ viz. that he was an Arch-Heretick, a Dogmatist, a declared Here'tick,
“ an heretical Apostate, a feigned Penitent, negative and obstinate, an im-
“ penitent and relapsed Heretick, a Ludwran, Anabaptist, Calvimst, Mar·-

f} tianist Heretick, even-tho' they died before Condemnation. Resides this
