The INrssonuc'rIoN.

ou Christ3 how they settled the Faith by t'ne Doetrines of Athanasius, Cyril,
and other Fathers 3 and if he can bring himselfto pay any Reverence to their
Decrees, I envy him not the Submiffion he pays them, nor the Rule by which
he guides and determines his Belief.

I confess Ι cannot read the Account of these Transafflons‚ their ascribing
their Anathemas and Curses to Christ and the Holy Trinity, and their De-

cifions as to the Faith, to the Holy Ghost, without Indignation at the horrid⁴

Abuse of those sacred Names. Their very Meeting to pronounce Damna-
tion on their Adversaries, and to form Creeds for the Consciences of others,
is no less than a De-monstration that they had no Concurrence of the Son of
God, no Iulluenee of the Holy Spirit of God· The Faith was already settled
sor them, and sor all other Christians in the sacred VVritings, and needed no
Decifion of Couneils to explain and amend it. The very Attempt was In·-
solence and Usurpation. Infallibility is a necessary Qialification sor an Of-
fice of such importance. But what Promise is there made to Councils of this
divine Gift? or, is there should be any such Promise made to them; yet
theMethod of theirDebates‚ their scandalous Arts to defame their Adversaries,
and the Contradiffions they deereed for Truth and GospeI, proves, to the
suilest Convietion, that they forfeited the Grace of it, And indeed, if the
Fruits of the Spirit aie Leve, Pence, Long-szffiring, Gendemss, Goodness, and
Meekmff's, there appeared few or no Signs of them in any of the Councils.
The Soil was too rank and hot to produce them.

I Wlss]‚ sor the Honour of the former Times, I could give a better'Ac-
count of these Ass'emblies os the Clergy, and see Reason to believe my sels
that they were, generally speaking, Men of Integrity, WVisdom, Candour,
Moderation and Virtue. The Debates of such Men would have deserved

’ Regum, and their Opinions would have challenged a proper Reverence, But

even had this been the Case, their Opinions could have been no Rule to
others, and how great a Veneration soever we might have had for their
Cliara&er8, we ought, as Men and Christians, to have examined their Prin·
ciples. There is one Rule superior to them and us, by which Christians are
to try all noeti-'mes and Spirits ‚· the Decision of which, is more sacred than
that of all human Wisdom and Authority, and every where, and in 211
Ages obligatory. But as the ancient Councils consisted os Men of quite
Other DispofitiOHSJ and 38 their Deeifions in Matters of Faith were arbi-
trary and unwarranted5 and as those Decifions themselves were generally
owing to Court Prakticeffi intriguing Statesmen, the Thirst of Revenge, the

Llanaqement of a few crziscy interested Bishops, to Noise and Tumuit, the:

Prospeets and Hopes of Promorions and Transsations, and other the like
Cause53 the Reverence paid them by many Christians is truly surprizingss
and 1 cannot accountsor i: any way hut one, vive.. that those who thus ery
np theii· Authority, are in hopes of succeeding them in their Power,· and
therefore would seign persuade others that their Decrees are sacred and
binding, „to make way for the impofing ostheir own.
