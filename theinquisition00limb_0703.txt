'Martem which the Criminal may be supposed likely to have forgot; because
in a Matter done a great while ag0, such Forgetfulness may be presumed
Lastly‚ that a Negative be convieted by Witneffes to have asserted that he·
doth so believe himself, and that others ought to believe so too. ³

Such a Negative is kept in hard Confinement, and laid in Irons, and is by
the Bishop, Inquisitor, and others ostentimes admonished to confess the
Truth, wit-h the Hopes of Mercy if he doth, and the Threatning of being

delivered to the secular Court-if he perfists in the N egative. [f he still persists

in the Denial, the Bishop and Inquifitor, either separate, or together prin
vately examine the Witneffes themselves, and by other good Men, and ad-
monish thern to tell them the Truth privatcly, that the accused Person may
not die unjustly. If the Witneffes persist in the Affirmative, and the Party
accused in the Negative, they are examined with greater Care ·, not that the
Witnesses are confronted with the Person they accuse, that they may be ex-
amined together. 'Tis only recommended to the Inquisitors [ο use prudence
in searching out the Truth‚ lest it should happen that an innocent Person, who
can’t fully defend himself, should be unjustly condemned. Thus the Madrid
Instruffion orders, An. 1561.. ἐ. 38. Thai the Inquisttorsfhould carefully consider
in the Defences of the Criminals, that being confined in secret Jayls‚ they can’t fi)
conveniently defend themselves, and that therefore they ought to supply this Defebi¹ by
their Diligence and Prudence, in inquiring particularly into the Life, Manners, En-
mity or Conspircecy of >the-IfVitneffi’s. -If any-one of the Witneffes faulters, or if
there are other Sigus against him, they are taken -notice of, that the Truth
may be found out. {f they are found false Witneffes, or if they retract their
Evidence, the accused Person is pronounced and dismissed as innocent, and they
themselves condemned to perpetuallmprisonment, and oftentimes exposed as
publick Spestacles upon Ladders before the Gates of certain Churches, and
their Lives only mercifully spared them. But if the VVitneffes persist, and
the accused Person persists also in the Negative, having been kept in Jayl for
acompetent Time, viz· a Year, he is at last, by the Sentence of the Bishop
and Inquisitor, cast out of the Ecclefiastical Court as obstinate and impenitent‚
and delivered over to the secular Arm. So that if it should happen that he ie
accused by false Witnesses, and-is really innocent, the miserable Wretch, tho*
falssy condemned, is delivered to the Power of the secular Court, to be burm:
alive3 nor is it lawFul for him, without the Commission of mortal Sin, as thePang,

not committed. And therefore in this Case, tho’ it may seem very hard [ο such
a Negative to die when he is innocent, and for this Reason he may possibly
believe it lawful forhim to confess the Crimes objected to him to save his Life,

> yet this is not to be suffered by any Means ; and therefore ’tis the Duty of the

Divines and Confeffors, who comfort such a Negative, and attend on him to
his Punishment, to persuade him to discover the Truth ; but to caution him
by all Means not to acknowledge aerime he hath not committed, to avoid
temporal Denth3 and to put him in Remembrance, that if he patiendy en-
