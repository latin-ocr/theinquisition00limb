Faithful of Christ to apprehen-d and detain their Persons, and deliver them

Maxims which prevailed in France, were very different from those amongst

of the Authority of the King -in Ecclesiastical Caufes, and desire him, that
at present he would not be the Author of so many NoveltieS. Orzstlle execu-

the Pontiff about it, obtained that the Affair of the Bishops should be

Cardinals in Matters relating to the Office of the holy Inquisition, in a Con-
