Effuston of Blood, and Danger of Death3 according to Cap. Novium, ,je verb·
fign. where, after 'tis commanded that aClergyman degraded shall be de-
livered to the secular Court, ’tis added, Por whom newertheleAE· the Cibum) 01!th
effeHually to intercede, that the sentence may be moderated, so as [0 prevent Dangei·
ofDeath3 viz. least the Inquifitors, when they deliver Criminals to thele-
cular Judges‚ Ill-iould seem to consent to the Effufion of Blood, and thereby
become irre u ar.

When thisgSentence against a Relapse is concluded, the Bishop and Inqui-n, 200„
fitor don’t lhew it to the Criminal, lest he should be enraged against thern ·‚
but they send to him certain good Men, especially Religious or Clergymen,
not unacceptable to him, who discover to him the Sentence to be pro-
nounced against him, and the Death to be inflicted on him, to confirm him in
the Faith, to exhort him to Patience, to accompany him after his Sentence,
to comfort him, and pray with him, and not to depart from him, till he
hath returned his Spirit to his Creator. But they must diligently take Care,
that they do not say or do any Thing by which the Death of the relapsed
Person may be hastned‚ viz. by exhorting him when condemned, to offer his
Head -to the Executioner, or to go up the Ladder, or to say to the Hangman
fo to-direct his Sword, as to strike off his Head at one Blow‚ and not at se-
veral, or to say or‘do, or persuade to any Things of like kind, by which his
Death would be sooner· effeeted‚ altho’ the same would have hapned, altho’
these Words or Actions had never been ς· because they contra& Irregularity
by these Things. Who would-not believe that theseMen detested with all
their Soul every Effusion of Blood, who so effectually intercede for the Con-
demned, and are so extrearnly careful not to say or do any Thing by which
their Death may be hastned ?· Here some think, that such Penitents relapsed
ought to be allowed Ecclefiastical Burial, as well as all other CatholickS. But
this is contrary to Law and Custom, because their Bodies are burnt with Fire.
In this Respeft however they are dealt more favourably with than the Obsti-
nate and Impenitent, inasmuch as these latter are burnt alive, whereas the
others are strangled before they are burm, which, as Simancas says, is more

human, and leads to Repentance. Tit. 47. ς. 17.
