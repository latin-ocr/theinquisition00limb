(ί that to cure so great an Evil he would take Care to send the O'ffice of
‘⁶ the Inquisition into those Countries. Upon this Cardinal Henry, then In-
“ quifitor General in the Kingdom of Portugal, ereeted the Tribunal of the
“ holy Inquifition in the City of Goa, the Metropolis of that Province, and
‘⁶ sent into those Parts Inquifitors, Officials, and other necefl‘ary Ministers,
“ who should take diligent Care of the Affairs of the Faith. The first’In-
“ quisitor was Alexim Diaz Falccmo, sent by Cardinal Henry, March 15'. A.

After having at large related these Things, Sousa thus concludes, “ From

“ these Things‚ and from the Apostolick Bulls, of which the Originals are
“ preserved inthe royal Archives, and in the Rolls of the holy Inquisition ; as

⁶< also from the Books ofthe particularInquisitors of this Kingdom, 'tis evident,
⁶⁶ that the above mentioned Authors are mistaken in their Account‚ that Sa-
“ havedra ereeted the holy Tribunal of the Inquifition in Portugal‚ or was the
‘⁷‘ Cause of its Erection. For before this the first Apostolick Brief for its
“ Institution was publish'd, 1531. and the second, A. 1536. whereas Sa-

“ hwedm, according to those Authors‚ was not till three Years after, viz.
⁶⁶ A. 1539. which Paramus ought to have observed.'' But Paramus also far-
ther affirms, That before the Year 1539. the Inquifition was in Portugal‚
and tells us, that the same Didacus de Syl-va was Inquifitor ; and that this In-
quisition was no better than an Image of the genuine Inquifition 3 and that the
Inquisition‚ after the Manner of Spain, was brought in by the Fraud of Sa-
havedra. Soustz adds also other very probable Arguments to shew the Rela-
-tion of Pareamus to be contradistory‚ and ends his Account with this 3 “ That

* [John Peter Maffeius, Hist. Indic. I. 16. p. 758, 759. gives a more distinct Account of the
Original ofthe inquisition at Goa. About the same Time there was an horrible Wickedness com-
mitted at Lorinum. ln the principal Church of that City, there was put up a Cheli, to receive
the Charity of pious Perspns'. They who had the Kc—eping of it, found in it some vile Papers‚ con-
taining horriblc Curses and Reproaches against Christ, the Author ofthe Salvation of Mankind.
Belides, Conſszlvus sylvam, a Jesuic, a Man noble by his Birth, but much nobler for his Virtue
and Learning³ who then prcached in the same City, and afterwards was ssain for the Cause of
Christ, at Monomotapa in AEtkicqfn'a² was reviled. This most impious, wicked and audacious
Crime was suspefled by many plain TokenS‚ to be committed by the false Brethren of the Circum-
cifion, of which Dregs several from Europe were by Stealth admitted for Money‚ by the Wardens
of the Pom, or Massers of Ships, and brought into the Indies, under the Disguise of Mer-
chants. There they conspired the Prcjudice aud DeliruCtion of the Christian Name, with the
AEgvpiians who were generally Jews, and of whom there was a great Number in those Places,
and‘ with Persons of other Nations and Sefts. Upon this Occafion the King began to introduce
the sacred inquisition into those Countrics‚ which is there exercised to ‘t'his Day at Goa, by proper
and approved persons, skilful in the Divine Law‚ to the great Advantage of the Christian Reli-
gion. All these Things are taken Word for Word out of Maffeius² by paramus, I. 2. t. 2.
c. xviii.]

This insertion the learned Author ordered to be added, p. 89. but as he forgot to mark the Word
after which it should be put, 1 have added it, 1 think, in the proper Place, andin a marginal Note,
that Ι might not spoil his Conneffion.
