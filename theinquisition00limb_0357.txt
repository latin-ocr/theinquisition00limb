“ four·, in other leffer Towns two only in each. But in every Sea-port 01·
“ Frontier Town four may be chosen. If more are chosen they have no
“ Privile e.

“ By tghe same Constitution 'tis provided, that in every Province there ς, 18.
“ should be given in to the Confistories of the several Cities a List of the Fa-
“ miliars‚ that the Governors and Magistrates may know them, and see that
“ they don’t exceed the Number ·, and that ifthey are quarrelsome,0r unworthy
“ their Office, they may report it to the Inquifitor General and Council ;
“ which is also to be done when any one is put into the Room ofanother Fa-
“ miliar. ’Tis farther appointed, that in all Civil Causes the Familiars shall be
“ cited before the secular Judges as much as if they were not Familiars.

“ But in Criminal Causes the Familiars are exempted from the Jurisdiftion §- 19·
“ of the secular JudgeS, and are to be punissied by the Inquisitors, except in
“ the Case of Treason, and the Crime against Nature, Rebellion and open
“ Sedition. Likewise the Familiars are to be punished by lay Judges, ifthey
“ offend against Letters of Safety granted by the Prince, if t'ney obstinately
“ oppose the RoyalCommands, if they betray and ravish XVomen, if they
“ are publick Thieves‚ Breakers open of ChurcheS, Monasteries, or other
“ Houses‚ or if they set them on fire, or commit any other greater and more
“ heinous Crimes than these, or if they insolently and obstinately contemn the
“ royal Judges, or if they refist them, or if being themselves in secular Offices

“ they commit any Offence therein.

“ Farther, the secular Judges may take up the Familiars for those CrimeS, ς, 20,
“ the Cognisance of which belongs to the Inquifitors, but must immediately
“ send them to their proper Judges, with a summary Proof of their Offences,
“ at the Cost ofthe criminalFamiliar. 'Tislikewise provided by the same

“ Constitution, that as often as the Familiars offend in any City or Place
“ where no Inquifitors reside, they shall be so often obliged to shew to the
“ Judges of the Place, where the Familiar hath committed his Offence, a

“ Copy of the Sentence pronounced by the Inquifitors against him, with a
“ publick Testimony that he hath satisfied the Sentence pronounced against him

“ for his crime.

‘¹ But if any Difference arises between the Inquifitors and secular Judges ς. 21.
“ concerning the Cognizance of any Offence committed by a Familias, the
“ Cause must be referred to the Royal Court‚ with a summary Proof of the
“ Crime, that upon hearing the Case by two royal Counsellors, and two others
“ of the Senate of the holy Inquifition, the Cause may be remitted to those
“ Judges to whom the Cognizance of it shall appear to belong, simply, with·-
“ out Noise and Form of Judgment. And from this Sentence there must be
“ no A ppeal. F arther, ifthese supreme Judges shall dis-agree to whom to send
“ the Prisoner, and three of them should not be of the same Opinion, the
“ King must be consulted. In the mean while the Familiar must be kept in
“ Custody by that Judge who took him up·, but his Trial must be deferred
“ till he is sent to his proper Judge, to whom, upon a Declaration made, he
