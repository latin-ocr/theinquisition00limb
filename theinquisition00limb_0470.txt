surh much Ligin will bespread, and great Advanlczge will accrue ·, and mitigate thei-r
Penances according to the Nature of their Convetston and Merit, or she-w them Regard,
as you shall think proper and con-venient. Thus also the Council of Tarracon: But
let perseo? Heretickc, and Dogmatisers, ifthey will he converted‚ after Absolution and
Abjurczlion, he shut up in perpetual Imprzsonment. Hence in the Sentence of Pe·
ffl’* sent. ter Auterius, a Dofkor of the Albigenses, we read: Saving however, and retain-
anmfflho- ing, that if thou wilt turn from this Seri* and Heresy, and be converted‚ and return
‘ql-fil· 40· to the Ecclefiasticcll Unity, thy Life shall be saved: reserving however to our fhlves
full andfree Power of enjoining thee a Punishment and wholesome Penancefor the

Things thou host done in thy former Sel? and Heresy.
The Reasons they affign, why they receive to Penance penitent Arch He-
reticks, or Dogmatists‚ are these. Because, i1sl they are converted‚ and

which they themselves have taught, they can more eafily refute them by Wri-
ting or Talking, And finally, because DogmatistS, truly converted‚ and
openly penitent, are as it were a clear Mirror of Repentance and Humility,into
which Simers may look. and be converted‚ and be preserved in their Duty.
This is especially to be observed, when an Arch Heretick is of great Authori-
ty, for hisDoctrine and Dignity‚ and who therefore, it may be hoped, will
convert many by his Authority. And thus Berengarz'us was heretofore recei-
ved. However‚ the DoCtors now think, that confidering the most miserable
Condition of these Times, in which Hereticks dare every Thing that is irn-
pious, all Arch Hereticks are to be delivered over, without Mercy, to the se-
tit. 47*- cular Court, because, as Simancas says, <T hey deservo to die not one Death only,
§- 54· but many ς and therefore he is for punishing them not as other Hereticks, but with
§- 7¹· foverer Punishments, without any Compnffion. He far'ther says, That the Masters
ς’ ⁶3⁴ of the Lutheran Heresy are by no Means to bespared 3 as being tainted with many
chs and Crinzes, viz. Enemz'es to the Church, Haters of the Saints, Violators of the
divine Low, sacrilegious Persons‚ Corrupters of good W orks, and thereforeof all good
Masmers, ond Sub-verters of Nations. And therefore he adds, they must not besor-
given, who commit stcch wicked‚ abominahle, and heinous Crimes. Thus als0, ac-
cording to Pegna, “ No Arch Heretick, though he should give Proofs of a.
“ rea1C0nvers10n, ought to escape the Punishment of Death. But because
“ the Church is kind and merciful, there is no Papal Law by which ’tis pro..
“ vided, that Dogmatists shall, without Diffinstion, be delivered over to the
“ secular Court. Yea, the contrary may be gathered from Cap. adabolendum.
‘⁶ de haeret. But then especially are Arche Hereticks to be received, when
“ they come, without any Inquifition after them, or being cited or called by
“ Name, but oftheir own Accord, to confess their Sin, and implore Mercy,
“ But when they are received, he wil] have very heavy Penances enjoined
“ them, which oughtnot to be mitigated‚ but after a long Season‚ and the

⁶ most evident Sigus oftrue Repentance, Converfion and Humility.
