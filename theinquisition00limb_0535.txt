have denied to do, or not fincerely fulfil those Things which we hai-e promised to oh-
serve. And as to Swines Hesh we promise lo ohserve, that if we cannot poffibly eac
it through Custom, yet that we will, without Contempt or Horror, take and eat
fhings that are dreffid with it. And zf in all theſs? Things which are above mem
tioned, we shall be found Transgreffors in any the least Point, or shall prefizme to ab?
contrary to the Christian Faith, or shall delay tofulfil in Wra‘ ana' Deea' what we
have promised agreeable to the Catholick Religion .· We fovear hy the same Father,
Son and Holy Spirit, who is one in Trinity, and the true God, that whosoever of us
shall be found a ‘Z'ranhgreſjbr of all or any one of these Things, he shall perish with new
Hames or Siones. Or if Goodness shall reserve him for Life to your Glory, he shall
lose his Liherty‚ and forfeit all his Substance‚ and shall he for ever a Slave to any
Person you shall appoint. And whatsoever you shall command to he done as to him or
his Effeffl, you shall not only have free Power to do it by the Power of your King-
dom, but by the Engagement of this our Ordinance. vnis Ordinance was made
.March 21. in the happy Sixth Y ear of the Reign of your Glory, in the Name of
God, at Toledo.

But Pfgna is of Opinion, that a more certain Suspicion of secret Judaism
arises from other observed Rites of the Jews, viz. from too intimate conver-
fing with them, by frequenting the Places in which they dwell, and especi-
ally the Synagogues, by the Observations of the Sabbaths, and many o'her
Things, than from their Abstinence from Swines F1e1h‚ which may be ei-
ther unpleasant to the Taste, or nauseous to the Stomach. This Considera-
tion particularly affehts the new Converte, who, through Custom, cannot be
supposed easily to relilh Swines Flelh, or other Meats forbidden them before
their Converfion. But this doth not hold as to their Children and Grand-
children, and other Descendants, who can't be supposed to abstain from
these Things for any other Reason, but their Reverence and Approbation
of this accursed δεξὶ, because the Reason of Custorn cannot be pleaded in
their Behalf, though it may as to those who are themselves converted.

Amonost other Signs of secret Judaism, the Narne that a Person takes is
accountefi' one. For they say 'tis customary amongst the Hehrews frequently
to give the same Name to those who corne over or return to their sest, which
they had before they were baptized. If therefore any Person, after Baptism,
in which he put off his old Jewish Name, and took the Narne of some Saint‚
according to the Custom of Christians‚ shall take it again, or some other
Name familiar and usual amongst the Jews ς it will be a Presumption that he
approves Judaffm.

ln how many, and in what Cases the Jews and other Infidels are subjec‘l:
to the Power of the Inquifitors, Gregory XIII. hath largely declared, An.
1581. by a Rescript, beginning, Antiqua Judaeorum‚ which {hall be hereafter
mentioned.

As to the Punilhments of such offending Jews, their Crimes are distin-Carena‚ '
