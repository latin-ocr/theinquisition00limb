The DEDICATION.

versai Applause of all good Men, for the common Advan·
tage of the Reformed Chmcbes,

The Book it self contains the Sentences of the Tholouse
lnquifition‚ pronounced during the Space of fixteen⁴ YearS,
principally against the Albigenfi’s and V aldenses, about the
Beginning of the Fonrteenth Century. In these Sentences
there are not only many Curious Things‚ which greatly

from the Church of Rome, but that there may be no Room
for Calumny, from those of the Popish Dofflors, and even⁴
lnquifitors themselves 3 that hereby the vast Powet
granted to the lnquifitors, the most cruel Laws of it, and
theinjust Method of Promiase, quite different from the
Usage of all other Courts, might appear to the whole
World, and that hereby the Pa pacy it self might be known
to all Mankind to be what it really is. For indeed there.>
is. nothing that more evidently discovers its Nature, than·
that immense and supream Power, hy which the Pope of
