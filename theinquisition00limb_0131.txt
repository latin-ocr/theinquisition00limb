all the most necessary Points of RelIgion, something more than is sufficient to
preserve the Knowledge and Praffice of Religion in the world, h. e. sonte
very unnecefl'ary Points of Religi0n3 something on which the Pieservation
of Religion doth not depend3 and of Consequence‚ Subscriptions to unne-
ceffary Articles of Fasth‚ on which Religion doth not depend, can never be
necess'ary to qualify any Person for a Minister of the Church of Christ, and
therefore not for the Church os Engyon& ifthat be Part of the Chi-isch nfesta-ist.

to such Things, as to oblige them to subscribe what they need not preacb,
nor any of their People believe.

Upon his Lordship’s Principles, the impoling Subscriptions to the hard
unscriptural Expreffions ofthe Atlsmmst'ans and Asiam, by each Party in their
·Turns‚ and to the thirty nine Articles ofthe Church of England, must be a very
-unreasonable and [inchristian Thing 3 because, the Peculiarities to be sub-

are not necessary to preserve Religion in the World 3 and after so pnblick a
Declaration of Charity towards all Denominations of Christians, and the
Safety of Religion and the Church, upon the general Principles he hath laid
down, there is no Reason to doubt but his Lordship will use that Power and
Influence which God bath entrusted him with, to remove the wall of Se-
