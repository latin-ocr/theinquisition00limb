The H1s-romr ofthe INQUISITION. 235

and making a Panse, the Person abjuring repeats what is read ; then the
Notary goes on, and the Abjurer always repeats his &Vordffi with a loud
Voice‚ so as to be heard by all, till the whole Abjuration is read over even
to the End.

Formerly, before Persons violently suspefted of Heresy abjured, the Bi.-
flwp or Inquifitor used thus to address to him. My Son, we violently sisseefft γοα
queresy‚ upon account of those Things 'tis declared you have committed, αροῑῖαεεοέιηί
of which you are by Law to be condemned as an Heretick. Therefhre censider and
attend to what I say to you. ff you willso depart from the szid Heresy or Hercsses,
as to be willing now here puhlickly to ahjure them, and patiently to andero: the Pe-
nance which we enjoin you, the Church and we, as the Vitars of Clam-fis will re·-
cez've you to Mercy. But we wilt enjoin you a Penance‚ which γοα may well hear,
and- absolve you from the Sentence of Excommunication, which γοα were under, that
you may be saved, and have Glory in the future World. But if you wilt not ahjure,
nor submit to Penance‚ we wilt immediately deliver you to the stecular Arm, and so
you will destroy together both Body and Soul. Which therefore wilt you chuſso, to ab·
jure and be saved, or to refuste to abjure and to be damned ,Ρ If he says, I will not ab-
jure, and perfists init, he is delivered over to the secular Coun, as lhall be
afterwards Ihewn. But if he says that he will abjure, the Abjuration is made
according to the Forms prescribed. But now the Bishop u‘ses no such Dis-
course‚ but before the Criminal is brought upon the Scaffold‚ all Methods
are diligently made use of for his Conversmn, and if he be truly converted,
he will abjure without any such foregoing Admonition. ,

This Abjuration is injoined all who return from Heresy, and even all Direet.p.3;
suspected upon any Account of Heresy 3 nor is any one, tho' otherwise pri- com. 40·
vileged, and of great Dignity‚ excepted. Even Boys of fomreen, and Girls
of twelve Years old, are compelled to it, according to the Decree of the
Council of Tholoufi’, An, 1229. cap. 11. Let all Peisons‚ as well Men as Wo-
men, the Moles from fourteen Iiears old and upwards‚ and the Females from twelve,
abjure every Heresy extolling it st'ff against the holy and Catholick Church of Rome,
and the Orthodox Fauo, under whatfhever Name it be ranked. The Council of
Biterre hath decreed the same. And this perhaps is the same which is cited
ina Book concerning the Forni of proceeding against Herezicks. And that

by the Help of the Lord Heresy may be the better extirpate& and the Faith sooner
planted in the Earth‚ cause the Statutes aad Laws puhlis'hed on these Accounts hy the
Apostolick See, and the Legates and Princes thereos, to he most fully ohservcd. Far·
thermon, cause all Persons, Males and Females, the Moles from fonrteen, the Pe-
males from twelve Years old aad upward5‚ to ahjure every Heresy‚ and to swear that
they wilt keep the Faiih, and defend the Catholick Church, and persecute Hereticks‚
as is above more fully and largely contained, in Reference to them, in the Oath which
those who are to be reconciled must make, writing down the Names of all of them,
as well in the Ans of the Inquifflion, as their rispetti-ve Parifhes, and if any
present shall not take such Oath within 15 Days after their Return, let them be ac-
counted fiispefi‘ed of Heresy. ‘l‘ ake Care also that this uni-versit Abjuration be per·
formed as soon as you can, either hy your-gog& or your Notaries or IVrilcr5‚ orlby
