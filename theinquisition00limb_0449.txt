so for the same Reason it seems equitable, not to confiscate their Goods. In

Italy ’tis rather owing to Custom, than to any Right given by the Popes, not

to confiscate the Estates ofpenitent Hereticks. But in Spain this Confiscation Simancas
of the Effects of Hereticks takes place, even tho' they are penitent‚ by theta, 42,
Papal Anthority, and the Laws of their own Kings ·, for there they believe §- 17· ΕΡ,
that the Inquifition ought not to restore the forfeited Goods even of Penitents, t· 4⁷·
to the Damage of the Treasury, when once it harh a Right to confiscate§' 15·
them.

But if any return to the Church within the Time fixed by the Inquisitors‚ §.170

the Catholick Kings have ordained‚ that they may recover and dispose of their

own Effeci& as tho’ they had never fallen into Heresy‚ except they attempt

to alienate their immoveable Effects ·, for this they are prohibited to do, with-

outa Decree ofthe Prince, lest they should dispose of all their Effeci& and

fly over to the Enemies ofthe Catholick Religion. 2 Instruit. Cap. 5.

In the Conditions of Peace prescribed to Raymond Earl of T hoiense, it is far-

cording to their respective Sexes and Ages. Lusty Boys they order out to

some mechanick Trade. The Girls they put to Service to some honest Ma-

can't work, either thro' their Age, or bad Health‚ their Pity reaches no far-
