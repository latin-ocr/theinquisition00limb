As to the Heirs of those who are suspected of the Crime of Heresy, and §- 7⁷²⁷

who are Favourers, &a of them, they must not be condemned to pay those
pecuniary Penalties, if such suspected Persons die, whilst the Accusation is
depending3 because Suspicions‚ though vehement‚ are extinguished by the
Death of the Criminals. Cap. Accusatus. ξ. Porro. Moreover, if any one, upon
accountof the Receptim, Defence‚ or favouring of such Hereticks, shall have bound
his Estate to perform that Penance which the Inquisttors would enjoin him, aad shall
die besore such Penance he enjoin’a' him, his Heirs shall not be obliged to make

such Satisfaffionfor a Crime already extinguifh’d by Death. Nor can they be corn- Eymer.. ἢ
pelled to perform apersonal Penance enjoin'd to such suspefted Person, burm-‘2³² ³

not aftually perform'd by him. But they may be forced to perform the Pe-c‘m

nance actually enjoined him, whilst alive, out of his Estate. Cap. Accusatus.

that isit was enjoined him to build a Church or Hospital‚ or to restore Usury,
and the like, and he hath bound his Estate for accomplilhing the said Pe-
nance, to whatsoever Successor, even though to any particular one, such Εε-

lay'd to perform it 3 or, as above-mentioned, have tied their Estates tofulfil it.

He who is violently suspected, is to be condemned as one convic‘ted of He »
resy, and as an Heretick. Cap. Excommunicamus. 1. ᾗ. in vero. Extra. dc
haeret. lib. 5. & Cap. Cum contumacia. & Cap. Ut Officium. For he either con-⁴
{effes his Crime or not. If he confeffes‚ and will return, and abjure his He·
resy, he must be admitted to Penance. Cap. Ad abolendam. ὅῑ Cap. Externum—
nicamns. 2. §. fin. If he doth not consent to abiure, he must be delivered over·
to the secular Court‚ and receive his deserved Punissiment. Cap„ Ad abolendam,
§- 1. If he doth not confess his Crime after he is convicted, and will not con-
sent to abiure, he is to be condemned as an impenitent Heretick.. Cap. An?
abolendam. From these Thingsit appear8‚ that although a light, a vehe-
ment, or violent Suspicion, arise from different Causes‚ yet it may huppen
that a light Suspicion may at length arise to a violent one, and the Bcgina
ning of a violent Suspicion end ina light one.- For instance, it oxsie-lightly.
