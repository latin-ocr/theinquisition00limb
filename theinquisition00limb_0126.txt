Laity{ and grew, many of them, rich, by the voluntary Oblations of the
People: But the Grants of that Emperor confirm'd them in a worldly Spirit,
and the Dignities and vast Revenues that were annexed to many of the Sees,
gave Rise to infinite Evils and Disturbances. So they could but get Pos-
seffion of them, they enred not by what Means, whether by clandestine Or-
dinations, scandalous Syniony, the Expulfion of the Poffeffors, or through
the Blood of their Enemies. How many Lives were lost at Rome, Constantem-
pla, Alexandria and Antioch, by the furious Contentions of the Bilhops of
those Sees3 [lepesing one another, and forcibly entring upon Poffeffion?
would Athanasius, and Mummius, Damasus, and others, have given Occa-
fion to such Tumults, and Mmders, merely for Words and Creeds‚ had there
not been somewnat more substantial to have been got by their Bishopricks?
Vsould Cuil hare persecured the Novatians‚ had itrnot been for the sake ostheir
Riches‚ of which he plunder'd them, soon after his Advancement to the See
of Alexandria? No. The Clia1⁴a8ter given by the Historian of vyeodofius,
Eissxop of bjsnada, may be too truly applied to almost all the rest of them;
who persecuted the Followers of Macedonius, not from a Brinciple of Zeal
for the Faith, but through a covetous Temper, and the Love of Money.

IV. Ι think i: will evidently follow, from this Account, that the Deter-=
minations of Councils, and the Decrees of Synods, as to Matters of Faith,
are of no manner of Authority, and can carry no Obligation upon any Chri-
stian whatsoever· Ι will not mention here one Reason, which would be it
self sufficient, if all others were wanting, viz. That they have no Power
given them in any Part of the Gospel Revelation, to make these Decisions in
controverted Points‚ and to oblige others to subscribe them3 and that there-
fore the Pretence to it is an Usurpation of what belongs to the great God,
who only bath, and can have a Right to prescribe to the Consciences of
Men. But to let this pass, what one Council can be fixed upon, that will
appear to be composed of such Persons, εις, upon an impartial Examination,
can be allowed to be fit for the &Vork of settling the Faith, and determin-
ing all Controverfies relating to it? I mean in which the Majority of the
Members may, in Charity, be supposed to be difinterested, wife, learn-
ed, peaceable and pious Men? Win any Man undertake to affirm this
of the Council of Nice? Can any Thing be more evident than that* the
Members of that venerable Affembly, came, many of them, full of Paffion
and Resentment3 that others of them were crafty and wicked, and others
ignorant and weak? Did their Meeting together in a Synod immediately
cure them of their Defire of Revenge, make the Wicked virtuous, or the
Ignorant wife? Ifnot, their joint Decree, as a Synod, could really be of
no more &Veight than their private Opinions,· nor, perhaps, of so much3
because, ’tis well known, that the great Transaffions of such Affemblies,
are generally managed and condueted by a few3 and that Authority, {er-
