seeing thesizid Proceffes carried on by you, and without allowing any'Appeal. If the
Inquisitor finds the secular Judge to be so negligent, as not to take Care to
put to Death the Hereticks delivered to him after these five or fix Days
are elapsed, tho' there be nothinglegally to hinder him, then the Inquifitor
may command him to execute the Punishment of Burning, or of Death, up·
on the Hereticks left to him, since this is the Punishment usually inflicted on
such ·, nor will the Inquifitor hereby fall into Irregularity. But. others think
it a safer Method, that the Inquifitor should not in this Case mention by Name
the Puni-shment of Burning, or Death, commanding the secular Judge to in-
filet it, because poffibly he might become irregular; to avoid which, he
makes the usual protest-atlon, when he configns over Hereticks to the secular
Judge; and therefore they think it safer, that he lhould in general command
him, under Penalty ofExcommunication, or other Censures, to put in Ex-
ecution the Sentences pronounced by him. This manner of speaking is con-
tained in a Rescript of Alexander IV.. beginning, Ad Audieutiam3 and of,
Leo X. beginning, Honestis petentium votis : Or that he should observe the Con·
stitutione. and Laws published against Hereticks‚ which Manner is not
obscurely injoined by Innoceut 1.V. in Extrav. Ad exstirpanda, ᾗ. Damnali vero·
