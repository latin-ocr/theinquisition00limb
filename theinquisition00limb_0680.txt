Sometimes, however it happens, that the Inquisitors do, either thro’ Im-
prudence or lnadvertence, offend against this Admonition of Zanchinus, as may
be conceced from an Instance related by Gonsalvius. “ In the Inquifition at
“ Seville, the-y proceeded by an lnquifitory Censure against a certain Citizen‚
“ upon Account of Religion. Amongst other Parts of his Punishment, he
“ forfeited all his Effeets and Incomes, on which he had lived creditably

offend concerning the Faith, may two ways offend the Church. First, by,
only believing amiss, ¹and also by publishing Herefies„ Secondly‚ when be-

Churches, destroyed Images, killed Catholicks, or committed the like
Things. If they offend in the first Manner, and are returned, the Inquifitora
may, ifhe will, before they are absolved from Excommunication, exa& from
the Person returning, not only an Oath of obeying the Commands of thes
Church, but also Security and Bail, under Penalty ‚ofaFinc ofobeying-‚such ,
