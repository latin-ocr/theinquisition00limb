Irons in the Convent of St, Paul, afterwards several more of them, and at last
severely punished all of them, according to the Nature of their Offence. They
who were the most guilty were burnt, after long Imprisonment and Torture;
such as were less guilty, had their Families render'd infamons ·, great Num-
bers had their Estates confiscated‚ and were condemned to eternal Darkness
and Chains. A large red Cross‚ with Cross Rays, upon a yellow Garment,
which they call San Benito, different from the rest, was put on most of them,
as an Example to others, and by the Severity. of the Punishment, to be a Ter-
ror to them. All these Things seemed at first grievous to the Provincials,
but especially that the Children should suffer for the Parents Crimes, that Peo-
ple should be render'd guilty by a private Accuser, and condemned without
being confronted with the Informer, contrary to the ancient Custom, when
Oli'ences against Religion were punilhed with Death. But what they looked
on as the worst was, that the lnquifitors took away all Liberty of free Conver-
sation‚ having their Spies in Cities‚ Towns, and Villages, which they thought
to be the lowest Slavery. Amongst many different Judgments, some were
against Death‚ tho’ all thought very severe Punishments should be inflicted.
Amongst these was Ferdinand Pulgarim, a Man of a iharp and ready Wit‚ who
wrote the History of King Ferdmcmd. Others thought they ought not to have
t-he Benefit of Life and the common Air3 that they ought to be punished with
Forseiture of Goods, and with Infamy, without any Regard to their Children 3
that this was wisely provided for by the Laws, that Parents should be render’d
more cautious, by their Affection for their Children ·‚ that dropping of Actions
would be prevented, by allowing private VVitneffes ·, and that by this Means
none would be punished but such as were plainly convicted, or confeffed:
That the ancient Customs of the Church were often changed, as Affairs and
Times required ·, and that greater Licentiousness ought to be restrained with
greater Severity. Judges were chosen out of every Province, to whose
Pleasure the Fortunes, Reputations, and Lives of all Persons were com-
mitted.
’ These Transaffions at Seville were soon known all over Spain, upon which
divers Intimations were given to their Catholick Majesties‚ that most of the
Jews lately converted to the Faith, whose Parents had been perswaded to be-
lieve by the Sermons of St. Vincentius Ferrerius , used secretly in their
Houses the Jewish Rites, and taught Christians the old Law : That therefore
they earnestly besought their MajesticS, out oftheir Catholick Piety, to put a
Stop to these growing Evils, least the poisonous Contagion should every Day
spread farthcr·‚ sor otherwise, unless a Remedy was immediately applied,
great Inconveniences would accrew to the Church of God. Amongst these the
Chief were Peter Gonzalez a Mendoza, Archbishop of Seville‚ Friar Thomas a
Turrecremala, a Preclicant, the Prior of the Convent ofthe Holy Cross at Sego—
