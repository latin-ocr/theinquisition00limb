put by the Procurator of the Exchequer, it ought not to be allowed by tlze
inquisitor 3 least isan ignorant Witness, wluch almost all the common and
vulgar People are, should answer, it was possible, and really isso, the same
Procurator of the Exchequer, after the Process is ended, and the Proots ex·
amined, 1hould by such a Caution shake the Credit of all the Proofs urged
in Behalf of the Criminals.

If there is any Reason to doubt of the Faithfulness, Constancy or Silence of

ally kept in the holy Office till after their Examination. But if he be an hg*
nest Man, of good Condition and Reputation‚ and in no Danger of discover-=
ing any Thing he hath acknowledged‚ he is immediately dismissed after his
Examination.

No Copy of the Depofitions is or ought to be given before the Examina-2
vtion is finished. Buti'f after the Examination of some, the Criminal declares
that he renounces any farther Examination, a Copy may be given him.

Altho', after the Publication of the Evidence, Witnesses are not to be ad-Simane'.'
mitted upon the same ArticleS, or others contrary to thern, yet in the Causetit· ⁶4·
of Heresy they are always to be allowed, whether it 116 for or against the 5· 50·
Criminal3 because, as this Publication is done in private, there can be no
Suspicion of the Witnesses being corrupted in these Causes.

It often happens that theWitneffes to be re-produced‚ or otherwise examined, Pegna,
are absent from the Place in which the Action is carried on against the Crimi- Cap· 54·
nal, and therefore there must 116 a Commiffion to examine them, or thei-r Ex-
amination must be committed to some proper Person.. And altho' in Cri-
minal Causes such Commiffion for examining distant Persons is not allowed,
the Judge himself being to interrogate the Wstneffes, and to confidet with
what Steadiness‚ Trembling, or Countenance they speak, yet such Commis-
sionis granted in the Crime of Heresy, and especially when the VVitnesses are
in remote Places, and in other Dioceses‚ and can’t come to the Inquifitors
without great Expence.

With these Letters of Commiffion there must also be sent to the Judge or
Inquisitor, to whom the Examination of Witneffes in Behalf of the Criminal
is commit-ted, Articles and Interrogatories‚ upon which the said Witnesses
must be examined, in the same Manner as if they were examined by the In-
quisitor before whom the Cause is tried. But the Inquisitor or Birhop, who
delegates the Examination to another, must not allow the Party to give
Articles for the Witneffes, before the Judge to whom they direct the Ex-
amination, but they are to be given to t'ne Judge of the Cause. When the
Examination is ended, the Judge, who receives these remissory Letters, must
take Care to transmit to the inquisitor who delegates him, an authentick Copy
of the original Procefis, faithfully extracted, compared with the Original‚
and subscrib²d by >the Judge and Notary. But if it can be done without Dan-
ger oflofing it, the original Copy it self must be sent to him, and the delc-
gated Judge keep the authentick Copy by him, If
