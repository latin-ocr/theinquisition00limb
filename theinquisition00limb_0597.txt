 

The Hmronr ofthe INQmsffmN.

Mina his poisonous Opinions, aeting herein as a Master, and thus doginatizing, bath
deceived his Hearers, and caused them to deviate from the Catholick T ruth, so thas
in very many Discourses he hath endeavoured to persttade all into the Belief Of hg,-
Errors. .

T 0 these Things I add, that by this suspebied Doc't'rine, contrary to the Faith (md

by his Deed or Word which was not right, he hath given manifest Occastbn of
Ruin to other Standers by, remarkable for their Probity of Mamers, Religion, and
good Life, who, by this Offence, have deviated from the Catholick Faith, and be—
ieved his O inions.
l Farther, libe aforesaid N. comesto be accuſsd, because, little regarding his spiri-
tual Prosit, and his Conscience‚ he dothvnot know how to stgn himself with the Sign
os the Cross, and · what· is worse, doth not know the Apostles Creed, the Lord's
Brayer, the Salutation of the Angel, and other Things of the like Nature.

Add to this something not less grievous, and affording great Suspicion, viz. that
there was found in his House a Book, or certain Volume, or Paper, containing the
Opinions and wicked Errors of Luther, Bucer, or other Hereticks‚ or the Law
published by Mahomet, all which. ‘Things secretly kept by him, and prohibited ty.
publick Edie't's, and the Ecclesiastical Censitres, afford no light Suspicion of his de„-

raved Heart„

p Farther, that having been otherwise received· to Mercy‚ because he had confes-

Jed his Errors‚ and being withal reconcikd, and united to the Bosom of holy Nlother

Church‚ who, according to her motherly Tenderness, doth not rejcbl those who fly t0 .
her, or having vehemently abjured, promising he would not affint to fitch Errors,

under the Penalty of being a Relapse, he hath fallen into them again. All which

,Things he did, and willingly performed, pretendedly, feignedly‚ and with an evil In·

tentiam only craftily to escape Punzshnzent, which appears to be plainly proved, fincez¹ .
like the Dog to the V omit, he hath returned to the same, and the like Errors, as is cer-

tain, bysufficient Evidenee. Hereby he is become liable to the Punishment of the Re-

lapsed‚ which therefore by Low! demand may be inflictea' on him, and therefore l

exhort your Lordship or LorathPs, that he may be cut offas a Member, now alnzcst

dead,⁴ and incapable of the Influences of the Head of the Church, viz, Christ, [md

may be thrown out, separated and excluded from the Conversation of the End-ful,

that there may be no Occafion to others to waver in the Fano, and the whole Μή·

maynot be corrupted: And because the Church, of whose Men), he 55 nii-worth},.
bath nothing further to do with him, ,let him be thrust outfronz her as an un-
