'the Inquifiti0n‚ and puniffied as Impenitent. So that 'tis not Iawful so much
>as to mutter any Thing against the Judgments of this holy Tribunal‚ tho’
>they are unjust. This Simancas plainly teaches. ‘⁶ He who is reconciled to §. 23:
“ the Church, and says he never was an Heretick‚ but that he confeffed
⁴ “ Things he never committed, through Fear of false Witnesses‚ iz :o be pu-
“ nished as an Impenitent‚ unless he repent. This is upon Suppofition that§- 26⁴
“ he hath not satisfied the Penance enjoined him 3 for ifhe hatn performed it,
“ he is rather Rash than Impenitent. Now rash Persons are to be punished
“ according to the Pleasure of the Judges, and sometimes to be scourged and
“ threatned with more grievous Punishments, if they afterwards fall into the
“ same Rashness.'’ Zanchinus treats more distinffly of such persons. “ Ifde heret,
“ any one, after having confeffed his Error, and receiv’d Sentence osPena ice, cap. ιζ.

“ Heretick ·, and ifhe bath abjured in his first Confeffion, he may be looked
“ on only as a feigned Relapse 3 but if he perfist in his Denial, he may be con-
‘f demned as an obstinate Heretick.”
In the mean while, that they may not appear to be the Defenders of any
unjust Sentence, they allow innocent Persons, who, wearied with Imprison-
s ment, and through Fear of Death, have confessed Crimes they never corn-
mitted, to have their Cause reheard before the Inquifitors‚ but with such a
³ Limitation‚ as is enough to deter the most innocent Person in the World,

l “‘ been an Heretick: if he can prove his Innocerlice, ought’not to neglect his
¹ “ Reputation, but to have the Cause heard over again by the Inquifitors. But
‘³ ifhe can't refute the Witneffes‚ norjustly retract his Confeffion, he ought
“ to confess that Sin to his Pari-{h Priest, anddo nothing more, lest something
“ worse should happen to him ;'' i. e. lest he should be dismiffed as an Irn-
penitent‚ and delivered over to the secular Court.
Befides these, there is another Kind of Impenitent5‚ viz, such who have
profeffed their Heresy, but don't observe ‘the Penance enjoin’d by the Inqui-
Ι fitor. Such are thought to be but feign’d Converts, and therefore Impeni-
ξ tent. Thus Simancas. “ Those who don’t satisfy the Penance enjoin’d them, Tit. 48'4
“’ “ ought to be punished asimpeni‘tent, perjured, and feigned Converts. They ἕ· 29-
“ are Impenitent, because they don’t perform Penance3 perjmed, because
“ they violate the Oath‚ by which they promised they would obey ‘the Com-
“ mands of the Church; feigned ConvertS, because they neither perform
“ true Penance, nor remain in due Obedience to the Church.'' Friar Bernardtn wc. .
Comenfis‚ in his Light of the Inquisstion, calls these Impenitent. But Peg›.⁷a1mpoen¹-
ΙῖῧΙγε, there is Need of mature Deliberation‚ and manifold DistinCtions in this ’Μ’ · '¹' 3„
atter.
However, Simancas doth not rank them with other Impenitents, because ι
he adds, ‘⁴ That such Impenitentsalge not immediately to be left to the seclu* ς· {22
