6 The Hrs'romr ofthe INQmsrTroNss

To this they subjoin the Effeers of an Interdict, to shew that if this Censure
be not used with some Difference‚ it will destroy the Church. It is worth
while just to recite these Effeers in the Words of the aforementioned Place
Alma A‘ffater. and from the Extravagant Provide. Because, says he, by fite}
sort of Statules the Indevotion of the People is forgotten‚ Herefies spring up, an infi-
nite Numhcr of‘Danget·5 ariste to Souls‚ and the Church, without her Fauii, loses the
Obedience due to her. The Words of the Extravagant are these ; Prayers for the
Demi, especially by the frequent Oblation of the salutary Host‚ are either entirely pre.
vented, ον greatly leffined 3 young Persons and children more seldom partake of the
S acmments, and are thereby less inflamed and confirmed in the Faith, the Devotion of
ὼε Faithful grows cool‚ Herefies spring up, ancl the Dangers of Souls are encreast’d.
The Gloss upon the same Chapter Alma Mater says, That after the Removal
of the Interdirst from any Place‚ Persons of thirty or forty Years old, who had
,never seen the Mass celebrated, laughed at the Priests as they were celebra-

nisttnff. tingit. Sotus a famous Doctor says, Thai though an Interdibi‘ on one hand tends

ω- Q· 3-to terrisy the Excommunicate‚ yet on the other it endangers divine Service, ‘especially if

Artic. ¹· it lastsfor any confiderezhle while3 for that not only the Laity lose their Affeb'lion and
Regard for divine Services from not being accustomed to frequent them3 but* even the
Clcrgy ihemselves grow more remiss and indolent in performing them .· Uspen which Ac.

Heretofore they used, three times a Year, solemnly to anathematise He-
peonap„2.reticks of every ὃεᾶ, viz. in the Day of Ccencz⁴ Domini, the Ascenfion, when
c02‘31. ιι. >Christ prayed. for all the Faithful, and in the F east of the Dedication of the

Churches of St. Peter and Paul 3 to denote that the excommunicate Person was
Hierolex ⁴deprived of the Sacrament of the Supper, that he could not partake of the
ἱ nnnnn ,Pray ers of the Church, and that he was expelled the Church, so that he could
Proceffus. not pra-y with the rest of the Faithful. To this Custom succeeded the Pro-
cess of the Bull, called In caena Domini, which was read publickly, and with
a loud Voice‚ every Year, on Holy Thursday, in the Morning‚ by the last
Cardinal Deacon‚ in the Presence of the Pope, and the rest of the Cardinals
and Bishops, by which all Hereticks are anathematized. When the reading
of it is finished, the Pope takes a little lighted Torch, and throws it into the
Sacer, as a Token of the Thunder sent against the Excommunicate. The
Use of this Bull doth not seem very antient 3 for neither Thomas, nor Eymeri-
cus, nor other antient Writers mention it. But it seems to have begu-n in the
Time of Martin V. about-the Year 1420. when the Bohemian Doctrine was ’
clamned by the Council of Constance, Paul ΙΙ. and Sixtus IV. make mention
os it in some RescriptS, beginning, Etfi dominici Gregis, Afterwards Leo X. en—
creased it against Luther‚ as did Paul 111. and the other Roman Pontiffs, till at
length, An. 1616. it was brought into this Forrn by Paul V. ⁴

T he pastoral Diligence and Care of the Roman Pontzff is continually employed, ac-
cording to the Duty of his Offioe, in procuring all Peace and Tranquility for the Chri-
stian ¹Republick 3 and especially fhines forth in maintaining and preserving the Unity
end Integrity of the Catholick Fausta, without which 'tis impqffible to please God 3 viz.
