‘⁶ But a Person may be calleda concealed Heretick in another Sense, viz. Simanc.
“ who by Word or Writing hath brought forth that· Heresy which he hath‘st‘ 52·
“ conceived in his Heart, tho' with Secrecy and Craft3 so that 'tis called
‘⁴ concealed Heresy, because’tis not notoriOUS, and can't be proved. Such a
⁷“ one incurs the Sentence of Excommunication‚ and is liable to the other
“ Punilhments of Hereticks, because he hath declared his Heresy, tho’ pri·

“ vately ·, and if he confeffes his Heresy before the Inquifitor, and repents,

“ he is to be privately absolved. Thus in the Seville Instrufflions, 1 Cap. 5.§. 11.
“ where we have the general Form of publick Abjuration laid down, with

“ this Exception ε Unless the Crime be so secret, that the Penitent only knows it,

“ and it can't be discovered hy another, in such Caſs? heis to besecretly reconciled and

“ abfhlved ·,'' which they thus explain, When an Heretick hath decl-ared or
written down his intellectual Heresy, and yet no one hath heard or read it,

tho’ others understand this of an Heresy purely mental.

Altho’ an Heretick be thus concealed, yet if he infects or perverts others, ς, 12,
he is immediately to be discovered to his Judges without any preceeding Ad-
monition. But yet they don’t affirm that a concealed Heretick is obliged· to
betray himself, when he is asked by the Judge in a general Inqulsition, Whe-
ther he knows any Heretick. In like manner, when an Heretick purely rnen-
tal confeffes hisv intellectum Heresy in the sacred Court of Penance, he doth
not incur Excommunication by this external Aa, because such an Aetion is ἕ· 9·
good and pious, and not liable to human Judgment.

Ereticks are farther distinguished into Affirmative and Negative. Affi1-..v Emer.
mative are such, who err in their Mind in Matters os Faith, and W110part. 2·

shew by Word or Deed, that they are thus obstinate in their Will, and open-q· 34·
ly confess it before the Inquifitor. Negative Hereticks are those, who, ac-
cording to the Laws ofthe Inquisition, are rightly and-{ustly convicted ofsome
Heresy before a Judge ofthe Faith, by some lawful Witneffes, whom either
they cannot or will not refute, but yet who will not consesS, constantly per·
sisting in the Negative, and that they profess the Catholici< Faith, and detest
heretical-¹ Pravity, They except indeed against Faets committed many Years
before, which are presumed to be forgotten. But even thiais not to be pre-
sumed in Facis of Importance and Weight, according tothe Sc-vz'lle Instru-
Ctions, An. 1484. cap. 13. Such are, Il} any hath wilfully preached up lie-
retica] Propofitions, or broken the Images of the Saints, Neither is this to be
understood of Persons of good Memorics‚ but only of light Facis, and ofPerae
sons naturally dull and forgetful. Who are to be esteemed such, and what 'sime
is to be supposed sufficient to such Forgetfulness, is entirely lert to the Eccles:⁴
astical Judges, after they have weighed theCircumstances ofPersons and Things.
He also is esteemed by many a negative Heretick, and, as it were, ‘llmlss
nute, confeffed, and obstinate, who doth not discover either all the Heresilea (ῗῒ
