The INTRODUCTION.

to be evei2 us in the ζυγά, to rule us, and to be our Guides ; W'ords that do net
imply any Dominion that they have over the Consciences of others, nor any
Right in them to prescribe Articles of Faith and Terms of Communion for
others. This they are expressy forbidden, and commanded to preach the
&Vord of God only, and pronounced accursed if they teach any other Gospel
than that which they have received from the Apostles. And Consequence
when we are bid to obey and submit ourselves to thern, it is means then, and
then only when they rule usin the Lord‚ when they speak to us fine Word of
God, and [αὔραν in the Word amlDoffi-ine. In all other Cases, they have no
Power‚ nor is there any Obedience due to them. They are to be respefted,
and to be had in double Honour for their er sake, i. e. when they preach not
themselves, but Chrzst Jesus the Lord,¹ and when their Faith and Conversatiou
is such, asto become worthy our Imitation. But if they teach otherwise, and
consent not to the Words ofour Lord Jesus‚ if they doat about bVords whereas come
Hit-vy, Strije and Railing, fitppofing that Gaia is Godliness‚ from such we are com-
mandedto withdraw our selves- T he Episcopal Charafier, however otherwise
greatly venerable‚ then forfeits the -Reverence due to it, and becomes con-
temptible. ⁵ ,

So that there are no Powers or Privilegesannexed to the Episcopal orM-i-
nisterial Charae'ter in the sacred VVritings, that are in the least favourable
to the Cause of Persecuti0n‚ or that countenance so vile and detestable a
Praftice. As to the Affair of Excomrnunication, by which the Clergy have
set the World so often in a Flame, there is nothing in the sacred Records
that confines the Right of exercifing it to them, nor any Command ever to
exercise it, but towards notorious and scandalous Offenders. The incestu-
ous Corinthian was delivered over to Satan by the Church in full Affembly,
on which Account his Punilhment or Censure is said to be by manv. And
though St. Paul bids Titus to rejeffi cm Heretick‚ he also bids the Corinthiam to
put away that wicked Person from amongst them, which had brought such a Scan-
dal upon their Church‚ and the Theffalonians, to withdraw themselves from every
Brother that ssaould welk diffirderly. So that as the Clergy have no Right, from
the New Testament‚ to determine in Controverfies of Faith, nor to2create any
new Species of Heresy‚ so neither have they any exclusive Right to cut off any

Persons from the Body ofthe ChuJ‘ch, much less to cut them off from it: for -

not submitting to their Creeds and Canons; and of Consequence no Power to
mark thern out by this A& to the civil Magistrate, as ‘Objecis of his In-

sdignation and Vengeance.

lhave been the >longer on this Head, that Ι might fully vindicate the

Α ,Christian Revelation‚ from every Suspicion of being favourable to Persecu-

tion. Notitithstanding some late Infinuations of this kind that have ¹been
thrown out against it by its profess'ed Adversaries, let but the Expreffions
of Scripture be interpreted with the same Candour as any other Writings
are, and there will not be found a fingle Sententze ‚to countenance this Do-
&rine and Praestice. And therefore though Men of corrupt Minds, or weak
Judgments, have, for the sake of worldly Advantages‚ or through strong
