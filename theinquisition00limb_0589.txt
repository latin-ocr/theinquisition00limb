‘0 from her by Torments, determined to put her to the Torture again, to force

“ out ofher what they thought she had yet concealed. Accordingly she

“ was made to suffer the most cruel Part of it, even the Rack, and tthcc cap.
“ Torture by Water, till at last they had squeezed out of her as with a Press, 29·

“ both the Herefies and Accusations of Persons they had been hunting af-300k 4·
“ ter. For, thro' the Extremity of her Torture, she accused her Mother

“ and Sisters, and several others, who were afterwards taken up 'and tortured,

“ andburnt alive in the same Fire with the Girl.'’

” But if they don't succeed neither with this Way, the Inquisitor permits some ¹07-
Person or other, who is not unacceptableto the Prisoner, to go to him, and con-

verse with him, andis it be needful to seign himself still one of his own Secl,

but that he abjured thro' Fear, and discovered the Truth to the Inquifitor.
When he finds that the Prisoner confides in him, he comes to him again late

in the Evening, keeps on a Discourse with him, at length pretending 'tis too1

late to go away, and that therefore he will stay with him all Night in the
Prison, that they may converse together, and the Prisoner may be persuaded

by the other’s Discourse, to confess to one another what they have committed⁴

In the mean while there are Persons standing at a proper Place without the
Jayl, to hear and to take Notice of their Words, who, when there. is need,

are attended by a Notary.

This Eymerz'ck taught was to be done in his Time. But now the Person, Consalv.
whothus treacheroussy draws out any Thing according to his Desire from hisp· 95-
Fellow Prisoners, prays the Jayl-keeper, when, according to Custom, he is
vifiting his Prisoners, to defire that he may have an Audience. For this is
the Method the Prisoners take. And when her goes out of his Jayl to give τω...
Account of his Office, he discovers not only what he heard from any or the
Prisoners, but also how· they received the Docti-ine proposed to them, whea
ther witha chearful or angry Countenance, and the like, if they refused to
give them an Answer, and what they themselves think of them. And the
Accusations of such a Wretch they look on as the best and most unexception-
able Evidente, altho' the Person be otherwise one of no manner of Worth,
Credit or Regard.

Theseisort of Persons· they call Flies, and, as Gonsalvius tells us, they may
be known and found out by this one Thing, that for the most part they
thrust. themselves into such sort os Conversations, without any one’s asking
them, and begin very impertinently such Discourses concerning Dostrine.
And therefore he advises, that if the Prisoners a& prudently, they will let
them tall< themselves weary, without giving them any Anfwer.

They who have been lately in the Prison of the Inquisition in Spain and,
Portugal, tell us osanotherMethod they make use of to draw a Confeffion from
the Prisoners, viz. The Inquisitor suborns a certain Person, to go and speak to
the Prisoner, and to tell him he comes of himself, and os his own Actor-d,
and to exhort him to tell the Inquisitor the Truth, because he is a mercisul..
Man, and such fine Tales. This is now partitularly the Custom in Spain and 2
