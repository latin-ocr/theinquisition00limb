“ one and that the Church hath granted Authority to all to extirminate He-
“ reticks ; tho’ others are of Opinion this can’t be done but by the Authority
¹ “ and Command of their Superiors·, which Opinion, according to Bruuius, is
³ “ the safest, ifnot more agreeable to Law, as Dominick apprehended it was.
ἵ “ But the most necessary Thing of all is, that no Injury be done to heretica}
η “ Univerfities or Communities, before they are pronounced guilty of this
‘⁶ Crime by a declaratory Sentence.''

But if Hereticks are apprehended, 'tis not lawfnl for any one to undertake

¹ their Defence ἦ. All Advocates or Notaries, who give Affistance or Favour

to Hereticks or their Abettors, or who plead for them when under Examina-
i tion, ox· draw any Instruments for them, are pronounced infamou3‚ and sus.
pended from their Office †. Hence they infer, ‘⁶ That no one must defend,
“ or be an Advocate for anv who are known to be Hereticks. As often in-
* “ deed as this is doubtful, and it is not yet certain whether the'VVords oi· Deeds
“ objected against any Person as heretical, do favour os manifest H.,i-esy; 01·
“ whilst the Charge of Heresy is not confirmed by VVstneffes, or other legalpegna 5„

ζ “ Proofs, any one may be Advocate for him, and plead in his Defence 3 i. e. iijreet.
¹ “ thelnquifitors allow him,and provided he take an Oath before-hand to makei’· 104·

 

‘⁶ ajust Defence‚ anti to defist from it as soon as ever it shall be known that the
f “ Person he defends 25 ¹{n Heretick. And this is always the Method observed.'’

The last Punil‘nment of Hereticks is that of Death‚ and—that not the corn-
mon one, but the most terrible that can be inflicted3 viz. to be burnt alive.
This they infer from 2 Kings xxiii. where Ozias commanded the Bones of the

χ heretical Priests robe burnt ; and from the VVords of our Lord, John xv. 6,

[f a Man abida not in me, he is castforth as a Branch, and is withered, and Menl- 5- c} 13⁴
guther them,and cast them into the Fire, aad they are barned. Here Brunus observes, §- ¹4·
some think that this Puniihment was introduced only by Custom, and can be

proved by no other Right, whither divine or human. This is his Opinion, for,

says he, this Punishmentcan’t be inferredfrom that Paffizge of the (Jospel, of throw-

ing the Branch into the Fire⁴ Far this speaks of the eternal Fire of Hell, and not of

the temporary Punzfhment of Fire. Nor do the Civil Laws prove this Punifhment.

For tho’ they fix that Punifhment against Hereticks, which we call Death, yet

they don’t expreſs this kind of Death, viz. the Pumfhment ofFire3 which undoubted-

ly the Lawgivers would have dane, zf they had determined to appoint it against Here-

⁴ ticks; especially as the Punifhment is st> terr-ime, that they expreſsly mention it, when

ever they think the Heinausness of the Crime defierves it ·, as may be made appear from
other constitutions, where this Punishment is particularly specifiea'. [However, Lu-
davicusa Paramo finds out th'rs Punishment of Fire in many Places ofthe New
Testament. “ James and John thought that the Samaritam, who would not
“ receive our Lord, should be destroyed with Fire from Heaven‚ according to
“ St. Lake. Cap. 9. See here now the Punishment of Hereticks, viz. Fire. For
“ the Samaritam were the Hereticks of those Times, Mat. xxi. and xxii.
“ Mark xii. and Luke xx. Christ adds three Pau-ables. One of the two Sons„
