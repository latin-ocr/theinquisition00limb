St. Mary’s Church‚ fitpra Minervam, except the Pope commands otherwise 3
and on Thursdays in the Presence of the Pope. These Congregations are held
every Week‚ excepting only the holy Week‚ which preceeds Easter. [How- messam

Δ

ever John de Loix relates‚ that there are held three Congregations of the holy an. 135-
Office every Week‚ vm? 22:-

The first is on Mondw, in the House ofthe holy Office, in which the Com-
rniffary General of the Inquifition, who is always a Pred'icant, and his Atten-
dants dwell. Here are present the Counsellors of the holy Inquisrtion, the
Fiscal, and other Officials‚ where the Proceffes, Votes and Sentences of all
of them are reported and registred. The Master General of the Predicants
takes here the first Place, the next the Master of the holy Palace, who is
always a Dominican‚ out of Respecft to St. Dominick‚ the Author and first Ma-
ster of this Office ; then two or three Layers, next the Vicar Gener-al of the
Predicants in the Absence of the General‚ next the Commiffary Genera] of
the holy Office, who is always a Predicant ·‚ next the Affeffor of the holy Of-
fice; next the Procurator General of the collegiate Friars Minors ; next the
Provincial Inquifitors, when they are at Rome 3 next the Affistant of the Com-
mifl‘ary General ·‚' next the Abbreviator of the Processe53 next the FiscaL
We must remark here, that the Master General of the Predicants‚ and the
Master of the sacred Palace‚ are also Counsellors to the Inquifflion, for
this Reas0n‚ because they are promoted to their several Offices.

The second Congregation is held on Wednejfday, when the Cardinals meet in
the House of the oldest, or the Dean of the Congregation, who have
decifive Votes·, although regularly they confirm what hath been determined
on Mondays by the Counsellors and Commiffary.

The third Congregation is always held on Thursday in the Presence of the
Pope, nor is it ever omitted, except on Thursday in the Festival Week of the
holy Sacrament, and sometimes in the Festival of Corpus Christi. In this
Congregation his Holiness decides or confirms the Votes of the Counsellors and
Cardinals. The Cardinals only s1t, all others standing. The Pope makes a
Prayer when the Congregation comes in, as the oldest Cardinal doth on Wed-
nesdayss and the first Counsellor on M'ondays. The Provincial Inquifitors‚ who
support their Authority‚transmit by Letter their Difficulties to these Cardinals]

These Things, says Paramus, l. 2. t. 2. c. 1. 77. 13. were not thus ordered
in the Beginning. For at the first the other Cardina13‚ the Pope’s Vimr, and
the Master of the sacred Palaee, were joined with Cardinal Carqffa, and ma-
naged the Affairs of the Inquifition. But afterwards when Caraffcz was elected
Pope on May, Cal. 5. 1556. the aforesaid Congregations were held on certain
Days in his Presence 3 which Custom continued in the Reign of Pius V. Gre-
gory XIII. and sixtus V. but was disused in the Time of Pius IV. who being
taken up with Affairs of very great Consequence, could not be present with
that Congregation.

In the mean while, as the Popes were conferring all this Auzhority on the
Inquifition, and the supreme Council of the Inquisz-tion by their Badis, several

Books were published at Rome sor thglnstruffion of the Inquisntors, xlfl· 1534»
