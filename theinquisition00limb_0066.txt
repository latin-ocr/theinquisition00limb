and Animofilyfor that Dignity‚ because when they had obtained it, they wer-estere to
he enriched by the Offerings of the Matrem, of appearing Abroad in great Splendor,
of being admiredfor their costly Coaches, sumptuous in their Feasts, out-doing Sove-
reign Princes in the Expences of their T ables. For which Reason Praetextatus, an
Heathen, who was Prefect of the [Citythe following ⁴Year, said, M‘ake me Bi-
fhop of Rome and I 'll be a Christian too.

Gratiam, the Son of Valentinian, his Partner and Successor in the Empire, was Ι

of the orthodox party, and after the Death of his Uncle Valens recalled those
Theod. whom he had banished‚ and restored them to their Sees. But as to the Arians,
1 5· 02· he sentSagcores, one of his Captains, to drive them, as wild Beasts‚ outof all
their Churches. Socrates and Sozomen tell us, however, that by a Law he or-
dained, that Persons of all Religions should meet, without fear, in their several
Churches, and worship according to their own Way, the Eunomians, Plo-otini-
ans and Manichees excepted.

Yheodzyius, soon after his Advancement by Gratian to the Etnpire, discover-
δοῖ. l. 7· ed a very warm Zeal for the orthodox Opinion53 for observing that the City of
c. 4 ⁶· Constanlineple was divided into'different Sests, he wrote a Letter to them from

Yheffizlonica, wherein he tells them, That 'twas his Pleafiere, that all hisSubjeEs

should be cf the same Religion with Damasus Bishop of Rome, and Peter Eifhop of
Alexandrhv, and that their Church only should be called Catholick, who wor-

ssiipped the Divine Trinity as equal in Honour3 and that those who were of
another Opinion should be called Heretick5‚ become infamous‚ and be subject

to other Punishments. He also forbid A ffem'olies and Disputations in the Fo-

rum, and made a Law for the Punishtnent of those that should presume to ar-

Soc. 1. 5. gue about the Effence and Nature of God. Upon his first coming to Constan-
c. 7· empse, being very solicitous for the Peace and increase 01‘ the Church, he sent
for Demophilus the Arian Bithop, and asked him whether he would consent to

the Nicene Faith, and thus accept the Peace he offered him3 adding, Ifyou re·

fuse to do it I will drive you from your Clmrches. And upon Demophilus2s Re-

fnsal, the Emperor was as good as his VVord, and turned him and all the Ari-

ans our. of the City, after they had been in poffeffion of the Churches there for

c· 8· Fort3⁷ YearS. But being willing more effectually to extinguish Heresy‚ he
summoned a (Touncil of Bishops of his own Persuafion‚ A. C. 383. to meet to-

gether at Coffiwzhumk, in order to confirm the Nicene Faith : The Number of

them were one Hnndred and fifty ·‚ to these were added thirty fix of the Mace-

Tzesecond dom-'an Party. And accordingly this Council, which is reckoned the second
generez! Oecunienical or general one, all of them, except the Macedoniam, did dectee
⁶⁰³⁴⁷⁷⁶²l2 that the Nicone faith should be the Standard of Orthodoxy ς and that all He-
A.C. 3 relies ssiould be condemned. They also made an Addition to that Creed, ex-
plaining the orthodox Dostrine of the Spirit agaInst Macedenizts, viz. aster

the Words Hol y Ghost, they inserted, The Lord, the Qtickner‚ proceedingfrbm

the Father, wlwm with the Father and the Son we worship and glorzfy, and who spake

Coi. by the Prophets. When the Council was ended the Emperor put forth two
The. d. Ediets against Hereticks3 by the first prohibiting them from holding any As-
