The H1sToRY of the INQUISlrron.

‘⁶ of St. Elizabeth, who had been instrucfted by John AEgidius, a Preacher at Se-
⁶⁶ ville, and suffer'd Death with great Constancy. From the same School came
⁶⁶ out Christopher Lostzda, a Phyfician, and Christopher Arellianus, a'Monk of St.
⁶⁶ Istdore, and Garstas Arias, who first kindled those Sparks of the same Religion
⁶⁶ amongst the Friars ofSt. Isidore, by his constant Admonitions and Sermons, by
⁶⁶ which the great Pile was afterwards set on Fire, and the Convent it sels, and
⁶⁶ good Part ofthat most opulent City was almost consumed. He was a Man of
⁶⁶ uncommon Learning, but osan inconstant wavering Temper 3 and being ex-
‘⁶ ceeding subtle in disputing, he refuted the very Dofflines he had persuaded
⁶⁶ his Followers to receive, tho’ he brought them into Danger on that Account
·‘ fr0m the Inquisltors. Having by these Arts exposed many, whom he had

⁶⁶ Pontius, and chrqnius, that he had not dealt fincerely withg his firiends, and
⁶⁶ those who were in the same Sentiments with himself, to which he replied,
⁶⁶ That he foresaw, that in a little Time, they would be forc’d to behold the
⁶⁶ Bulls brought forth for a lofty Spe&acle·‚ meaning thereby the Theatre of
⁶⁶ the Inquisitors. Constantine answer’d, You, isit please God, shall not behold
⁶⁶ the Games from on high, but be your selfarnongst the Combatants. Nor
⁶⁶ was Constantine deceived in his Prediffion. For afterwards Arias was called
⁶⁶ on 3 and whether Age had made him bolder, or whether by a suddain Al-
⁶⁶ teration his Timorousness changed into Courage, he severely rebuked the
⁶⁶ Affeffors of the Inquisitory Tribunal, affirming they were more fit for the
⁶⁶ yile Office of· Mule Keepers, than impudently to take upon themselves to

⁶⁶ lingly opposed, in their Presence, that Truth he now maintained, against
⁶⁶ the pious Defenders ofit, and that from his Soul he should repent osit whilst
⁶⁶ he liv'd. So at last being led in Triumph, he was burn’d alive, and con·
⁶⁶ firmed Constantine's Prophecy. There remained AEgidius and Constantine, who
⁶⁶ closed the Scene, but Death prevented their being alive at the Shew, AEgidius
⁶⁶ having been designed byUthe Emperor, 3philip's Father, for Bishop osDroffln,

‘⁶ a Dominican ·‚ and hereupon was suspended for a while from preaching, and
⁶⁶ the sacred Office, and died some Time before this Αξὶ. The Inquisitors
‘⁶ thought he had been too gently dealt with, and therefore proceeded against
‘⁶ his Body‚ and condemned him dead to Death, and placed his Effigies in
⁶⁶ Straw on high for a Spedhicle. Constantine, who had been a long while the
⁶⁶ Emperor’s Confefl'or, andhad always accompanied him2in his Retirement,
⁶⁶ after his Abdication from his Empire and Kingdoms, and was present with
⁶⁶ him at his Death, was brought before this Tribunal, and died a little before
⁶⁶ the Aet, in a nasty Prison. But that the Theatre might not want him, his
⁶⁶ Effigies was carried about in a preaching Posture. And thus this Shew,
⁶⁶ terrible in it self, which drew Tears from most who were present; when
