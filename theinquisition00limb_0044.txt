18 Thema-nonnemo&

Custom ofother Churches was different, who kept the Festival of Easter only ,
on that Lord’s Day which was next after the fourteenth of the Moon. This
Controversy appears at first View to be of no manner of Importance‚ as there
is no Command in the sacred Writings to keep this Festival at all, much less
1³11seb·1-5·specifying the particular Day on which it should be celebrated. Eusebius tells
ε· ²4· us from Irenaeus, that Polycarp Bishop of Smyrna carne to Anicetus Bishop of
Rome on account of this very Controversy ·, and that though they differed from
one another in this and some other leffer Things‚ yet they embraced one ano—
ther with a Kiss of Peace ; Polycarp neither persuading Anicetus to conform to κ
his Custom, nor Anicelus breaking offCommunion with Polycarp‚ for not com-
plying with his. This was a Spirit and Condu& worthy these Christian Bi-
lhops : But Vmor the Roman Prelate acted a more haughty and violent part ;
for after he had received the Letters of the Astatick Bishops, giving their Rea-
sons for their own Pmffme, he immediately excommunicated all the Churches
of Asta, and those of the neighbouring Provinces, for Heterodoxy 3 and by
his Letters declared all the Brethren unworthy of Communion. This Conduft
was greatly displeafing to some other of the Bishops, who exhorted him to
mind the Things that made for Peace, Unity, and Christian Love. Irenoeus- ν
especially, in the Name of all his Brethren‚ the Bishops of Emnw, blamed
him for thus censuring whole Churches of Christ, and puts him in mind of the
peace-able Spirit of several of his Predeceffors‚ who did not break off Commu-
[μνη mah their Brethren upon account of such leffer Differences as these. In· -
<imi this> Aftion of Pope Vmor was a very insolent Abuse of Excommunica-
sion ς :ind is an abundant Proof that the Simplicity of the Christian Faith was
greatly,> departed from, in that Heterodoxy and Orthodoxy were made to <dea ,Α
perid on Conformity or Non-Conformity to the Modes and circumstances of»
certain Things, when there was no Shadow ofany Order for the Things thern-
i‘clves in the sacred VVritings ; and that the Lust of Power, and the Spirit of
pride, had too much pofl'essed some of the Bilhops of the Christian Church. ,

’Tis no wonder that after this we should find Matters growing-worse and k
work. As the Primitive Christians had any intervals from Persecution they be·
came more profligate in their Morals‚ and more quarrelsome in· their Tem-
pers. As the Revenues of the several Bissiops increased they grew more Ambi-
tious, less capable of Contradiffion, more haughty and arrogant inf their Be-
haviour, more envious and revengeful in every part of their Conduct, and more ,,
regardlcss of the Simplicity and Gravity of their Profeffion and Charafter.

{21³1} the Dioclrsmn Persecution, to which I might add the later one of St. Jerom, .
are very melancholy and affefting, and shew how vastly they were degenera-
ted from the Piety and peaceable Spirit of many of their Predeccffors, and how
ready they were to enter into the worst Measures of Persecuffion, could they

but have got the Opportunity and Power.
