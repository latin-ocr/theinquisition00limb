He held much the same as to the Holy Ghost‚ making them Three eternal
Spirits‚ distinguish'd by a gradual and due Subordination, reserving the Mo·
narchy to the Father, whom he stiled the One only God. Being forced to
ssy his native Country on Account of his Religion he came to Gemma, where
there was a Church of Italian Refugees, several of whom, such as G. Bland-
rata‚ a Phyfician, Gribaldus a Lawyer, and Paulus Alcimus, differ’d from
the commonly received Notions ofmthe Trinity. When their Heterodoxes
carne to be known at Geneva, they were cited before the Senators, Ministers,
and Presbyters3 and being heard in their own Defence‚ were refuted by Cal-
τίη, and all subscribed to the orthodox Faith. But V. Gentilis having after
this endeavoured to propagate his own OpinionS, he was again apprehended‚
and forced by Calvia and others to a publick Abjuration‚ and condemned

“ to depart the City without Permiffion.” And this Penance he aftually un-

City‚ where they put him in Gaol. After they had seized all his Books and
Papers, they collected several Articles, with the Heads of an Indietment out
