The Hrs‘rORY ofthe INQUISITION]

munion of the Church of Rome, wasa dishonourable and vile Love of Wo-
men3 and they have most impudently dared to reproach with this Vice,
Persons that have been remarkable for their Chastity and Continence.. Ista
the mean while, nothing is more notorious, than that their Monks and
Priests‚ who ate forbid the Remedy of a chaste and honourable Matrimony‚
abandon themselves without Shame to the most impure Embraces, and infa-
moussy wallow in carnal Pleasures. Erasmus, Tom. 9. Perge 401. says; There
is a certain German Bishop‚ who declarecl publickly at cz Feast‚ that in one Yieor he
had brought to him 1 1000 Priests that openly kept Whores : For they pay annuallsy a
certain Sum to the Bishop. This was one of the hundred Grievances that the
German Nation proposed to the Pope’s Nuncio at the Convention at Norim·
berg, in the Years 1522 and 1523. Grievance 91. That the Bifhops in mostPlaces,
and their officials, not only suffer the Priests to keep Wheres, so they pay ct certain
Sum ofMoney‚ hut even force the chaster Priests, who live without Whores, to. pay
the Price of those that keep them ; allffiging, that the Bishop wants Money, and
that those Priests who pay it. may either remoin fingle, or keep Whores as they
please. How wicked a Thing this is, every one understands. The same Erasmus,
in his Account of the Errors of Reddet, Tom. 9. p. 484. hath the following Pas-
sage : thnt PVonder if sonze Nnns in the Age of St. Austin are said to have mar-⁴
