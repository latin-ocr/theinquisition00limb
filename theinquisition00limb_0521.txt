if they will, proceed by themselves, and that what they do or decree when
they proceed alone, either in condemning or absolving‚ is valid.

Here 'tis enquired‚ whether Witches‚ if they have confeffed the Murthers
of Children or Men, or any other Crimes to which the Punilhment of Death
xis annexed by the Civil Laws, may be delivered over to the secular Court by
the Inquifitors and other Judges‚ although they repent? Some think, that
notwithstanding their Repentance‚ they ought not to be perpetually impri-
soned as other Heretickffi but put to Denth. But the greater Number are of
opinion, that such of them who are willing with a pure Heart to return to
the Bosom of the Church, are to be received. Because the Cause of Heresy
hath nothing to do with murthering Children, or other Crimes committed by
Witches‚ the Cognisance of which doth notat all belong to the Inquisitors„
And therefore they believe the Judges of the Faith would do unjustly, if
they should deny to these Wretches, when willing to repent, the Benefit of
Mercy and Absolution.

But if these Witches are first taken up by the secular Judges for the Mur„
ther of Infants, or any other secular Crime, and when they are interrogated
confess Heresy, or any Thing that savours of Heresy, of which the secular
Judges have no Cognisance‚ and, upon account of this Confession, are deli-
vered over to the Inquisitors, in this Case when the Judgment concerning
Heresy is finilhed, they teach that the Witch must be turned back to the se-
cular Judge, that he may finili] the Process begun for other Crimes by the
Civil Laws. For in such a Case the Person is not so properly said to be left
to the secular Court‚ as to be restored to his former Judge, who upon account:
of the secular Crime, hath legal Jurisdicstion over such Witch. And this Obser-
vation is, as they say, according to the Constitution ofPius V. whose Words are

l these. Moreover, let them, without any Delay, tranfinit all Persam whatsoever im-

przfhnedfor any Offences, or by any Meam whatsoever accused ον demunced of any hez·-

’ nous Crimes, before the said Office of the Inquifitz'on, suspending she Cognffance of all
¹ other inferior Crimes, to the said Cardinals and Priscms ofthe Inquisstion, and there let

’ them be kept till the full C ognisance and Dispatch of the Crime of Heresy, and afterwards

let them be fi’nt back to the said Officials to expedite the Affaz'r of their other Crimes.
Yea farther‚ the Ecclefiastical Judges‚ if they have any legal Evidence‚
that one of these Witches‚ imprisoned by the secular Judge, is an Heretick,
or suspected of Heresy, may compel the secular Magistrate to deliver her
over to them to bejudged for the Cause of Heresy, and also to exhibit the

¹ Proceffes and any other Writings‚ in order to their Understanding, whether

there be any Thing contained in them relating to the Faith, and which may
help the Judgment of the Inquifitors. If the Magistrate refuses it, they may
compel him to all this by the Ecclefiastical Censure, viz. Excommunication,
Suspenfion and Interdict. Whereas the secular Magistrate cannot compel
the Judge of the Faith to deliver up to him Criminals of either Sex, who
have committed secular Offences, in order to punish them according to the
Civil Laws, because he hath no Jurisdifflon over the Ecclesiastical Judge,

But when the Ecclefiastical Judge lffitlg punilhed Offenders in his Tributthspelri
