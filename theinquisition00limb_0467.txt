 

The H1srom⁷ ofthe INQursirioN. '37

Pleasure of the InquifitorS. The Manner they are herein to observe, we have
in the Council of Narbonae, cap. 5. in these Words. This ‘zoe [ῃ tuly enjoin
in this Mamer, because we would not have you enjoin all the Penances af07.efhl·d
every where, or sttbjebi‘ all Perfhns to all of them, but that you fhould cautiousty and
wisely dispense them according to the Discretion given you hy the Lord 3 according to the
Nature of the Offence5‚ Pastum, Places, Times, and other Circumstances, so that
whether you punish 07⁴ parlim, the Life of Offenders may be amended 3 or at least thas.
it may appear who walks in Darkness and who in Light, and who is truly peniteat,
and who a pretended Convert, that from hence there may be no Scandal to true Cathoa
licks, nor under Pretence of Scandal, nor any other Way, as far as lies in your power,
by which Heresy may either be defended or nourished.

But if there be a great Number of Penitents‚ the Council of ‘Taracon hath
decreed, that a prudent Judge may use somewhat of Moderation. Like-wiſse ifBZOV· Ι
the Numberof Hereticks‚ or their Believers he large, and they are ready to abjure a. 1242„
their Hercsy, a prudent Judge may inflict Canonical Punishments on them, whether ς’ 4⁸
greater or leſs, according to the Provzfion of the Apostolick See, and thus avoid the

Punifhment of Intruston ξ. Or if the Number be not so very large, a prudent Judge may
use „Moderation according to his Discretion‚ as to the Believers in Hereticks, after ha2

ving confidered Circumstances. Provided always, that perfet‘t Hereticks, or those who
dogmatically affirm their Hercfies, or Believers of them being relapsed into fitch Belief,
after having abjured or renounced Heresy, shall heperpetually imprisoned‚ after having

fully abjured their Heresy‚ and Absolution from Excomtnunication, that there they
may save their Souls, and tnay not corrupt etheron.

Finally, also the Council of Narbonae hath provided, c. 18. that none re⁴⁵
covered from Heresy, ifthey had been greatly culpable, should be admitted
to any Religion ·, in these Words : And least stcch Perfhns should corrupt the Sim-
plicity of Religion, let none of the aforesaid Criminals enter into any Religion whatfh—
ever, without the Leave of the Lord Pope‚ or his Legate. And if any fitch shall
have entered without their or your Leave, after the Inquifition against them hath
been began, or even before, without having confffd, and being canonically abfhlved‚
recal them. Lastly, ’tis required that such as are reconciled, shall confess the
same Crimes to their own Parish Priest, after they have been jud'icially absol·
ved by the Inquifitors ·, which is also provided by the Madrid Instruekion : Astera, 156u
the Penitentfhall have been judicially ahsolved, let the Pricstsacramentally absolve him. ΜΡ· 71·
But they will by no Means allow such to be received, who, after a long
Time, and frequent Admonitions and Exhortations, scarce seem capable of
Converfion, and especially isthey appear so, at that InstantofTime‚ when they
are to be deliver²d over to the secular Court 3 because the Fear ofDeath seems
rather to induce them to seek Memy, than the Love ofTruth, Nor such who
by CommandS, Threatnings‚ PunishmentS, Rewards, sworn Promises, or
any other the like ways, endeavour to persuade any to Heresy, or obstinate-
ly to defend any Heresy they may have embraced. Nor finally such, who
have persuaded, or endeavoured to persuade, Kings, Princes, the Queen, 0¹¹
