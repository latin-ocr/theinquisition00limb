228 The Hrs'rorw osthe INQUISITION.

p· 192. Gonsalvius gives us some Instances of these Punilhments. “ There was at'
‘⁶ Seville a certain poor Man, who daily maintained himself and his Family
⁴‘ by the Sweat of his Brow3. A certain Parson detained his Wife from him
“ by Violence, neither the Inquifition nor any other Tribunal punishing this

“ heinous Injury. As the poor Man was one Day talking about Purgatory
“ with some other Persons, of his own Circumstances‚ he happened to say,-

“ rather out ofrustick Simplicity, than any certain Defign, that he truly had
“ enough of Purgatory already, by the rascally Parson’s violently detaining
‘⁸ from him his Wife. This Speech was reported to the good Parson‚ and
⁸‘ gave him an Handle to double the poor Man’s Injury, by accufing him to
“ the Inquisltors, as having a false Opinion concerning Purgatory. And
“ this the holy Tribunal thought more worthy of Punishment than the Par-
“ son’s Wickedness. The poor Wretch was taken up for this trifling Speech, ,
“ kept in the Inquifitors Jayl for two whole Years, and at length being
“ brought in Proceffi0n‚ was condemned to wear the Samhenito for three
“ Years in a private Jayl 3 and when they were expired, to be dismiffed, or
“ kept longer in Prison, as the Lords Inquifitors should think fit. Neithet·
‘⁸ did they spare the poor Creature any thing of his little Substance, tho'
“ they did his Wife to the Parson, but adjudged all the Remains of what he
ξ’ had after his long Imprisonment to the Exchequer of the Inquisition.
2195· “ In the same Proceffion there was also brought forth a reputable Citizen
‘⁸ of Seville‚ as being suspected of Lutheranism, without his Cloak and his
“ Hat, and carrying a Wax Taper in his Hand, after having exuat-isted his
“ Purse of 100 Ducats towards the Expences of the holy Tribuni and a
“ Year’s Imprisonment in the Jayl of the Inquifition, and having abjured as
“ one vehemently suspected, only because he was found to have said, that
“ those immoderate Expences, and on these Accou-nts the Spaniards are pro·
“ digioussy extravagant, which were laid out in erecting those large Paper
“ or Linen Buildings‚ which the common People corruptly call Monuments,
“ to the Honour of Christ now in Heaven upon Holy Thursdczy, and also those
“ which were expended on the Festival of Corpus Christi, would be more ac-
“ ceptable to God, if they were laid out upon poor Persons, or in placing
0. 196. “ out to good Persons poor Orphan Girls. Two young Students added to
“ the Number in that Proceffion. One because he had written in his Pocket·
“ Book some Verses made by a nameless Author‚ so artificially, as that the
“ same Words might be interpreted so as to contain the highest Commenda-
“ tion of or Reflection upon Luther. Upon this Account only, after two
“ Years Imprisonment, he was brought forth in Procesfion, without his Hat
“ and Cloak, carryinga Wax Taper, after which he was banished for three
“ Years from the whole Country of seville, made to abjure as lightly suspect-
'‘ ed, and puniffied with a Fine. The other underwent the same Censure,
‘⁸ only for transcribing the Verses for their artful Compofition‚ excepting

“ only that he commuted his Banissiment for 100 Ducats towards the Ex-
1‘ peuces of the holy Tribunal.”
