The HisToRY of the INQUISITION.

“ put in Chains by another Judge. Thus far the royal Constitution, dated
“ the ioth, and confirmed the 19th ofMarch, 1553.

We read osa famous Case ofthis Nature, concerning Jurisdie’tionbetween the
Inquisitors and secular Judge in Nicliolczs Rodrigues Fermostn0‚ which is added to
his Treatises of Judgrnents, &a This Fermostno was in the Office of Counfel-
lor of the Treafflry, in the Inquisition of Valladolid, and created lnquifitor,
and by King Philip IV. made Judge of the confiscated Effects of the said In-
quisition. 'l‘he Case was this: The Magistrates os Valladolz'd order’d rough
NValls to be built, to prevent Travellers coming into the City for Fear of
the Plague. Afissonizts Moreno, Governorrof the House of Penance, in that
City, and his Aunt Mariana de Pareda, formerly Wife of a certain Secre-
tary of the Inquifition at Ilei-ena, obstrueted this Building. And therefore
Jerom Antony de Torestllas, Mayor of theCity, took both of them out of the
House of Penance, An. 1648. 3d Cal. of August, and put them in the com-
mon Jail, and laid them in Irons. The Inquifition demanded of him three
Times, that he would release the-Prisoners‚ and send thern back to the Tri·
bunal of the Inquisition, as their competent -Judge, with all the original
Acts and Process. TherMayorsfirst said he would restore them, but after-
wards declared that he would notsdeliver them over, but under this Condition,
that the ,Tribunal-vlhould ⁴proceed to no other Process. The ‘Inquifition was
not satisfy’d with this, and the Affair was greatly contested on both Sides.
The Isquifition sent their Orders to the Mayor, and the Mayor, by his An-
swers, opposed the-Orders and Commands of the Inquisition. ffl-last, the
Dispute ran so high, that thelnquisttion, after a declaratory Injunction, laid
him under Excommunication and the Anathema·, and because he continu’d
to exercise every A& of Jurisdiftion, they put him under a general local In-
terdict. But this made no Impreffion on him·‚ for he answer’d, That the
Tribunal of the Inquilition had-no Jurisdietion over him ς and that whilst
the Dispute was to whom the Cognizance of the Prisoners belonged, their
Excommunication could not touch him, especially as he had appealed from
all Censures of the Inquisition. At length the Inquifition prepared to publish ’
the Order for Ceffation of divine Services. But the Royal Court, to put an

-End to this troublesome Difference, commanded the Mayor to dismiss his Pri-

soners ·‚ and the Tribunal of the Inquisltion‚ to destroy all the Acts and Pro-
cess against the Mayor, to grant him Absolution, and remove the Interdidh
But the Inquisition was not satisfy’d in this; but by Fermofim, their Fiscal
Advocate, prayed the King‚ That the Mayor might be severely punished,
adding this Reas0n‚ least a Way should be opened to infinite Contentions
and Extorsions of the like Nature; especially since the other Judges win
every Day‚ considering these Things went unpunished‚ urge many frivolous

Reasonsf slorstnot acknowledging any of the Censures of this Tribunal, in Con-
tempto u icc.
