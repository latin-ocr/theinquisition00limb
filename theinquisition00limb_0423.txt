The HISTORY ofthe INQUISITION. 255

“ rally speaking, so very poor, that they are not able to defray the Expen-
“ ces of the Nomries, nor maintain themselves whilst they are kept in Jayl,

“ As to the other Objeffion, That the lnquifitors ought to be content with
“ the Subfidy exaered from, or given thern by the Cross—bearers, he an-
“ swers, that this is far from being sufficient, because either they cannot οι·
“ will not give. Resides, many ofthem subvert the very End of their Insti-
“ tution‚ and are rather Masters over the Inquisitor, than subject to him, and
“ sometimes do more harm than good to this Holy Office. 'Tis true, many
“ of them are veryjealous and zealous for the Faith‚ who, according to the
“ Obligation of their Vow, willingly expose theirLife and Substance for the
“ Faith. But as they themselves are poor, they want Affistance instead of
“ being able to support others.'' He goes on, ‘⁶ Since this is really the Case‚
“ how can the Inquisitors sustain the Burthens of their Office? How can they

σε be able to repah- m· build Jayls? HOW can they satisfy the Keepers, and
“ other Officers? How can they provide Sustenance for the poor Prisoners,.

“ or Beds for thern to lie on? How can the Inquisitors themselves visit their
“ Diocese or Province? Who shall supply them with Horses and Ships?
“ Who shall give them, their Companions‚ Notaries, and Servants, the Char-²
‘³ ges of their Journey ? For 'tis not decent or safe that the Inquisitor should
“ travel alone. The Dutics ofthis Service are almost infinite, which neither
ξ( the Bishops, Cities‚ or Princes, will so much as touch with their Finger.
“ Since therefore the Italian Inquifitors have no Benefice, or Incomes, or if
“ they have, such as are not sufficient to maintain them, they may demand
“ their Expences, Salary or Fees. This however the Inquifitors and other
“ Officials who are Bishops, as they are in Spain, cannot do. Nor such who
“ receive their Expences from the Apostolical Chamber, as is observed at
‘⁸ Rome, or who otherwise receive Affistance or Support, to enable them to
ξ’ discharge the Duties of the said Officer
“ At this Time the Inquifitors affirm, that the Church of Rome is the Trea· Zanchim-
“ sury as far as relates to· the confiscated Effects of Hereticks3 and that she c. 26,
‘⁸ hath ordered that one half of the said Effeets shall be appropriated to her

“ own Chamber‚ and that the other half shall remain in the Office of the
“ Inquisition for the neceflary Uses thei-cof. ff This Custom is now obi'erved.”

2 Campegius‚ in his Additions, cites the Letters ofInnocent IV. directed to the
l Archbilhops and Bishops‚ and Provincial of the Province. We, treading inthe
l Steps of Pope Gregory our Predeceffw, of bleffed Iidemory, order that the movealsle
¹ EffeHs and Houses officch who are imprz‘soned for Heresy‚ shall be sold, if it can he
