“ before from Bzovius. But the Effe& of this was, that this Indulgence did
‘⁶ not lead them to an Amendment ostheir Crimes ς but as the Event proved,
‘⁴ was abused to a greater Indulgence of the Jewish Su erstitions; so that Ju-
“ daism spread more and more, as the Pope himself eclared in his Letters,

ιι dated July 15, 1547. in which he revoked‚ by Reason of their Perverseness,
“ several Privileges that he had granted them.

“ In the mean while King John ΙΙΙ. perceiv'd that the Faith was more and
“ more endangered, and as the Pope seemed to be negligent in the Affair,

“ he applied the Remedy of the Inquifition in the Manner as then appeared
‘⁶ most suitable to the Case3 and sent Letters to the said Pope, worthy of
‘⁴ the holy Zeal which inflamed him 3 in which. he acquainted-him‚ That he
κ had, with the greatest Earnestness‚ sol'lcited this Matter for fifteen Years‚
κ before his Predeceffor ClementVII. and himself. With-these Letters‚ and
‘⁶ the Reasons contained in them, the Pontiff was prevailed with, a-nd grant-
‘-‘ ed the Inquifition, A. D. 1536. From this Time the sacred Tribunal of the
“ Inquisition‚ and the Office ofInquifitor General hath been transmitted down,
“ even to our own TimeS, in this Kingdom„ by» an uninterrupted Suc-⁴
‘⁴ ceffion.'’

Deputies. or Counsellors of the supreme general Inquisitiom created by the se-
veral Inquifitors General. After this follow the Accounts of the Tribunals of
the Inquifition‚ ereeted in the several Cities of the Kingdom of Portugal‚ and
of the Names of the Inquifitors appointed for the several Tribunals. The
