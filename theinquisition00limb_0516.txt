As if any one in telling Fortunes about Sweethearts should deny God and the
Sacraments of the Church; or should mingle any of the Sacraments of the
Church with his Fortune-telling, or those Things which the Divines call Sa-
cramenta] ·, as if he Ihould baptize Images, rebaptize a Child, or only anoint
hini with holy Oil, or incense the Head of a Person dead, or do any of the
like Things to divine future Things, or use a Candle and holy Water to dis-
cover stolen Goods. All these Things render the Doer suspected ·, for unless
he had believed such Sacraments or Sacramentals had some Virtue to effe&
such evil Operations, he would not have used them for this Purpose. So that
the Inquisitors take diligent Care to interrogate them concerning their Belief,
and if they deny the Intention they are tortured3 and if they do not confess,
they may be made to abjure as vehemently suspected. They may also be pu-
nished with Excommunication, Suspension of Dignities, Whipping, Banish-
ment, Imprisonment in Monasteries, and other Puniihments, according
to the Quality of the Persons. They may also be publickly brought forth
wearing the infamous Mitre, or be disgracefully tied to a Ladder near the

Gates of the Church, and be banished from the Diocese.

Ιξς· τί· ¹2· tiouS. But there is one Species of it, which the Doctors pronounce erroneous

and heretical, viz. that which profeffes to foretel the Mysteries of our Faith
by the Stars. In like manner they are condemned as rash Astrologer3‚ who
pretend they are able to foretel by the Stars certain Things concerning the
State of the Church‚ Life or Death, or the Affumption os the chief Pontiff.
Pope Urban VIII. by a Constitution, beginning, Inscrutabilis, published Ap.
1. 1631,ς hath appointed, that Judiciary Astrologers, who make Judgments
concerning the State of the Christian Republick‚ or Apostolick See, or the
Life of the Roman Pontiff, or his Kindred, οι· who, when made, keep them
in their own Poffession, or ssiew them to others, or speak of them by WordS‚
besides the Punishment of Excommunication which they shall, ipsojure, in-
cur, shall be punished with Death as guilty of High-Treason, Confiscation
of Effects, and that if they are of the Clergy, they shall be puniIhed with
Deprivation of their Benefices and Offices.

We have also Instances osvery grievous Punissiments 'inflieted on thesejudiciary
Astrologers‚ one of which may be seen in Bzovius, under the Year 1327.
