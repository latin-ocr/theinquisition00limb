The HtsToRY ef the INQmsu-toN,

bouring Languedeck‚ there was a Synod held at Tarracona, about the Year
1240. in which there were many Things enaCked concerning Hereticks and
their Punissiments.

Even the Emperor Frederick ΙΙ. himself, put forth many Laws against He-
reticks, their Accomplices and Favourers, at Paciae, by which he greatly
promoted the Inquisition. In the first, which begins Commiffi nobis, he or-
dains, that those Hereticks who were committed by the Church to the secu-
lar Court, should be put to Death without Mercy: That Converts through
Fear of Death‚ should be imprisoned: That Hereticks, with their Abettors,
where-ever they were found, should be kept in Custody till they were punished
according to the Sentence of the Church : That Persons conviet of Heresy.‚
who had fled to other Places, should be taken up: That such as were re·
lapsed should be punished with Death: That Hereticks and their Favourers,
should be deprived ofthe Benefit of Appeal ς that their Posterity, to the se-
cond GenerationS, should be incapable of all Benefices and Offices; but that
their Heirs should be indemnified if they discovered their Parents Wickedness. ⁷
And lastly, he takes under his imperial and special Proteaeffion, the predicant
Friars, deputed for the Faith agai-nst Hereticks, in all the Parts of the Ern-
pire, and all others who were sent for, and should come sor the Judgment of
Hereticks, commanding the Magistrates severely to punish all couvi& He-
reticks, after Condemnation, by the Ecclefiastical Sentence. In his second
Ediet, which begins, Inconsutilem tunicam, after expressing great Abhorrence
ofthe Crime of Heresy‚ he commands all impenitent Hereticks to be burn’d
with Fire, and the Favourers of the Patarenes to be banished. In his third, be·-
ginning Patarenorum receptatores, he deprives the Children of Hereticks of their
Honours‚ unless any of them should discover one of the Se& ofthe Patarene53
and puts Hereticks themselves under the Ban, confiscating their Estates. In
his forth, beginning Catharos, he condemns all suspected Persons as Hereticks,
ifthey do not purge themselves within a Year ς commands his Officials to ex-
terminate Hereticks from all Places subjedl: to them 3 orders that the Lands of
the Barons shall be seized by the Catholicks, if they do not purge them from
Hereticks, within a Year after proper Admonition, and ordains many Punish-
ulilentshagainstst th1e F {tvouregs οἷς ῌῗὶτεῑὶἒςε, andhtheO ¹310st seyerle onIes agsainst
