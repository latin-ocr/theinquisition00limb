 

The Hrs'rorzv ofthe INQUISITION· 177

“ ‘there is no need of calling in many, and that a few of the better Sort—is
“ abundantly sufficient.'’

'Tis enquired by the Canonists, whether the Inquifitors are obliged to callp· 1· t· 8·
for the Vote of the Counsellors before Sentence 3 so that without it the 'Sen- ⁷⁷· 552 56·
tence shall be void. Carene„ doth not think them oblig'd to it ; and sayS, that
in the Inquifition at Cremona, he hath oftentimes seen Causes determined by
the Bishops and Inquifitors together, without ass<ing the Votes of the
Counsellors ς and adds, that they ought not so to trust to their Counsellors, as
to think themselves excused from reconfidering the Process and Books, and
examining ,the Cause 3 because as they are Judges‚ it is their Duty to examine
the Merits of the Process. ‘⁶ Hence itis that if the Inquifitors of hereticalRoyas‚
‘⁶ Pravity err in determining the Causes of the Faith, whether from their ownp·1· §4241
‘⁶ or their Counsellors Judgment, they are worthy of Punishment, and the
“ Votes of their Counsellors will not excuse them, because they ought to
“ have examined whether their Advice was proper or not. But if the
“ Qestion is too difficult and hard, either through the Nature of the Fac‘t,

“ or the various Opinions of the nouom, the Inquifitors are in some Mea·

“ sure excused through their Ignorance of an obscure Law. However‚ §4330
“ the Advice of the Counsellors, though wrong, hath this wonderful Effect‚

“ that though the lnquifitors are faulty, yet their Error is not to be imputed

-“ to Corruption. But to avoid all Blame, in all difficult and doubtful Cases 3

‘1 ,such as the Seisure of noble and religious Persons, and the Release of Cri-

>“ minals·; the Affair, with all the Merits and Vooes, is to be laid before

“ their Superiors‚ who are to be consulted‚ before it is put in Execution‚’'

Althoii'gh these Counsellors or Aflefl‘ors of the holy Office may lawfully be carena,
chosen by the Inquifitors‚ and are in Fa& deputed by them in several Cities,P· 1· t· 8·
as at Pavisz, and the other Cities ofthat Territory ·, yet at Cremona and Mi- ⁷⁷· 3² 4³ ἲ·

lan, the Counsellors, Advocate Fiscal, and Chancellor‚ are chosen by the
Cardinals, Inquifitors General ¹at the Nomination of the Inquifitors. So that
these Counsellors depend on that Congregation, and cannot be removed but
by it 3 because the Aa is his who confirms it.

The F ather and Son must not be chosen together Counsellors of the holyn. 32: ¹
Office. However, the Congregation of the supreme Inquifitors General, for the
Merits of Francis Caucius a Lawyer‚ deputed John Baptzst a Lawyer, his Son, as
a Counsellor of the holy Office, or rather as tan Affistant to his Father, who
had been a Counsellor of the said Office above thirty Years·‚ but upon this
Condition, That they should not be present together in the Congregations ·, be-
cause the Counsellors Votes ought to be altogether free.

The proper Place of these Congregations is the Hall of the holy Officc.„, ῖς,
Carena sayS, that he heard from some worthy Persons, that there are Letters
οξ the Inquifitors General upon this Affair, commanding that such Congrega-
tions, when held before the Bilhop, shall meet in the Episcopal Palace. But
,when the Bishop will not, or cannot ¹3} present, they shall meet in dg fl151on
