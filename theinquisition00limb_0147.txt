TheINTRonucmoN. 121

as St. Paul's Notion· of Heresy entirely differs from what the Clergy have,
generally taught about it, theirs may be allowed to be a very irrational and
{bsurd DoRrine‚ and the Apostle's remaina very wife and good one3 and
though they hare gone into all the Lengths of Wickedness to punish what
they have stigmatized with the Nmne of Heresy, they have had no apostolick
Example or Precept to countenance them3 Scripture Hereticks being only to
be rejeffed froin the Church, according to St. Paul, and as to any farther
Punishment, 'tis deferred till the Lord lhall come.

As to the Powers given to the GuideS, or Overseers,³ or Bishops of the
Ch-urch,I allow their Claims have been exceeding great. They have ass'umed-
to themselves the Name of the Church and Clergy, hereby to distinguish· them-
selves from the Flock of Christ. They have taken on thern, as we have seen,
to determine, mend, and-alter theFaith, to make Creeds for otherS, and
oblige them to subscribe them, and to aot as though our Saviour had divested
himself of his own Rights, and given unto them all Ροωεν in Heaven and
Earth. But these Claims have as little Foundation in the Gospel as in Rea-
fon. The Words Clergy and Church, are never once used in Scripture to de-
note the Bishops or other OfficerS, but the Christian People. St. Peter ad—
vises the Presbyters to seed the Flock of God, and to exercise the Episcopal Officez Px.
willingly, ² not as lording it over the Heritages, or Clergy of God. And St.
Paul, ,vriting to his Ephestans, and speaking of their Privileges as Christians,
says, that by Chrzst they were made God's peculim Lot, or Heritage, or '³ Clergy,
In like manner, the Body of Christians in general, and particular Congre-
gationsin particular Places, are called the Church, but the Ministers of the
”Gospel never in contradistinffion to them. 'Tis of all Beliexers that St=
'Peter gives· that noble Description, that they are a spiritual Haase, an holy
priesthooct, to sffir up spiritual Sacrifites, a chosen Generatim, a royal Priesthood, [112
holy Natim, and a ⁶ peculim People, or a People for his peculias Heritage, or
purchased PQffi’fflWs as the &Vord is render’d, Eph. i. 14. So that to be the
Church, the Clergy, and the sacred Priests of God, is an Honour common
to all Christians in general by the Gospel Charter. These are not the Titles ’
of a few only, who love to exalt themselves above them.

Undoubtedly, the Order of the Christian XVorssiip requires, that there
should be proper Persons to guide and regulate the Affairs of its And ·ac-
cordingly St. Paul tells us, that Christ gave some- Apostles, sbme Prophets, some Eph, ix<-
Evangelists‚ and some Pastors and Teachers, different Officers, according to theta,
different State and Condicion of his Church. To the Apostles‚extraordinary
Powers were given, to fit thern for the Service to which they were called3
and, to enable them. to manage these Powers in a right Manner, they were
under the peculiar Condu& of the Spirit of God. Thus our Saviour‚ after
his Resurrection, breathed on his Disciples the Holy Ghost, and said,
