The Hrsronv ofthe INQUISITION. 91

‘⁶ before suppreffed them in Languedoc, Dataphiny, and Provence‚ by the
‘⁶ Preaching of many famous Men, and especially of St. Dominick. And
“ therefore the Rescripts sent by the Popes to those Inquifitors, they ordered
‘⁶ to be observed by the Inquifitors of other Provinces, where there were any.
‘⁶ They were sent first to those of Italy, because they especially needed that
“ Provifion, and those Constitutions,'' One may also read in the Bulls the
same Laws often repeated, without any Alteration‚ by different Popes. For, Diremflq.
as the same Pegna observes, “ it seems to have been an ancient Custom, when PM·- 2·
“ the Matter required it, that every Pope‚ in the Beginning of his pontifi-Cf”²³³1⁶⁷‘³·
“ cate, should publish Laws against Hereticks, and Rebels against the²⁰
‘⁶ Church‚ to deter them from so great a Crime by the Severity of Punish-
“ ments and Penalties‚ and thus reduce them to the Bosom of the Church‚
“ Sometimes they publilhed the Laws received by their Predeceffors, with-
“ out altering a Word, unless the Occafion required otherwise.
This Tribunal was merely Ecclefiastical, the Civil Magi532·ate having no
Share in the Judgment. The Inquisitor, with the Bishop, pronounced Sen-
tence of Heresy against the Person apprehended. They appointed wholsome
Penances to the Penitent, and delivered over the Impenitent and Obstinate

to ἵζε PSj›·e:cular Court, who without any farther Deliberation condemned them
to t e ire.
