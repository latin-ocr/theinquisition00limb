had fully confeffed all, and humbly desired to be absolved from his Senten-
ces of Excommunication. Upon this he was absolved from the said Sentence‚
but immediately pronounced, degraded‚ condemned to perpetual Imprison-
ment, and to do erpetualPenance in Irons, and with the Bread of Sorrow,
and Water of A iction. Moreover, the Inquisitors reserve to themselves
the Mitigation of the aforesaid Penance, according as they should think ex-
pedient, and he himself should deserve it by Patience and Humility, and the
Sacrifice of a contrite Heart. But Pope John XXII. revoked this Reserva-fh2,135,
tion of mitigating the Punishment‚ and commanded that the whole Sentence
and Penance pronounced against him, should be rigorously and entirely ex-
ecuted.

The second Instance is that of William Garrici‚ who, besides 'his being preat
sent at the Heretication of a certain Person, and adoring Hereticks after an.
hereticalManner, is said to have consented, with others, in the Advice and
Endeavour, privately by the Affistance of one of the Servants of the said
Inquifition, to steal away and burn the Books of the Inquisition at Carcaffone,
in which were written the Confeffions and Depositions in the Fa& of Heresy‚
and to have hindred by several other Methods the Office of the Inquisition.
For this Reason he was excommunicated‚ and continued under it several
Years, and was condemned to be imprisoned. But atlength, after many E-
vafiom, he acknowledged his Fault, and submitted himself to the Pleasure
of the Inquifitors, humbly desiring Favour and Mercy from them. After he
had solemnly abjured, not only Heresy, but also the favouring, receiving,
defending, and partaking with Hereticks, he was absolved from his Excom0
munication, and had this Penance enjoined him 31 That in the first general
Paffage he should personally transport himself, where he should tarry during
the Pleasure or Command of the Inquifitors, or their Succeffors. Or if he.
should be legally prevented, that then he should be obliged to send in. his
Room, at his own Cost and Expence, a sufficient and proper Soldierfor the.
Defence of the holy Land. That within the Space of thirty Days he should
depart the Kingdom of ance, to such Place as the Inquisitors-should appoint,
there to abide till the Time of hisr transporting himself, or after that Time,
ifhe sends a Soldier in his Room. After this Sentence was-pronounced, read
and published by the InquisttorS, Master Wlliam Garrici, >uponhis bent Knees,
and with his Hands held up together, in Token of great Humility, said,
That he accepted the aforesaid, giving and returning Thanks„ first to the.
Lord Jesus Christ, and then to the Inquifitors‚ for these F avours bestowed
u on him.

POther M-agistrates are punished with Sentences os Excommunication, their
Countries are put under Interdi6t, and given to the first Conqueror of them,
many Instances of which we have seen in the first Book ,os this History. Anii
because this Office, in it- self hateful, is rendered much more so- by the excell-
five Cruelty of the Inquisi‘tors, who have hereby raised the Anger and In-
dignation of all Mankind against them3 therefore Pope Pius V. to prevent
the least Hurt or Injury from being offeredsthem, and every Hindrailice
