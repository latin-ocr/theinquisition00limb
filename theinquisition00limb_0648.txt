“ strike the miserable Wretch with greater Terror in Mind and Body, whent.
“ he sees himself going to be tortured by the Hands of one who thus looks:
“ like the very Devil.

Whilst the Officers are getting Things ready for the Torture‚ the Bilhop-
and lnquifitor by themselves, and other good Men zealous for the faith,
endeavour to persuade the Person to be tortured‚ freely t01c0nfess the Truth„
and ishe will not, they order the Officers to strip him, who do it- in an In-

. stant. Clergymen however must not be tortured by a Lay Officer or Tor-

tvurer, unless they can't find any Clergymen who know how to do it, or are*
wilhng, because it would be in vain for the Judges to order any Clergyman
or Monk to the Torture, if there was no Body to infliel: it3 and therefore in
such a Case 'tis usual to torture them by Lay Officers.

Whilst the Person to-be tortured is stripping, he is persuaded to=confess the-
Truth.. If he refuses it, heis taken afide by certain good- Men, and persua-
ded to confess, and told by them, that if he confeffes, he will not be put to
Deam, but only be made to swear that he will not return to the Heresy he
hath abjured. The Inquisitor and Bishop promise the same, unless the Per·
son be a Relapse„ ’

Ifhe is neither persuaded by Threatnings or Promises to confess his, Crime,
he is tortured either more lightly or. grievoussy, according as his Crime re--
quires, and frequently interrogated during the Torture, upon those Articles
for which he is put to it, beginning with the lesser ones,n because they think he
will sooner consess the leffer Matters than the greater.

The Inquifitors themselves must interrogate the Criminals during. their
Torture‚ nor can they commit this Busmess to others, unless they are enga—
ged in other important Affairs, in which Case they may depute certain«
good and skilful Men for the Purpose. 1 Instruffl. Hispal. c, 18. Altho' in

the Judges, Secretaries and Torturers, The Inquifitors must also chuse pro-
per Torturers, born of antient Christians, who must be bound by Oath, by·
no Means to discover their Secrets, nor to blab out any Thing that is said.
The Judges also usually protest, that if the Criminal should happen to die
under his Torture, or by reason of it, or should suffer the Loss of any of his
Lirnbs, 'tis not to be imputed to thern, but to the Crimina] himself} who·
will not plainly confess the Truth before he is tortured. An Heretick may,
