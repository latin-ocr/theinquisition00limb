 

The Hisromr ofthe INQUISITION- ἵξ

tends to> read opt ofit Things that are not contained in it, and then with an

Air of Admiration eries out, How can you deny it? Is it not fully evident to

me? But here they take Care not to come to such Particulars, from which

the Crimina] might easily gather, that the Cause is not so well known to the
Inquifitor as he pretends. He only mentions what he is certain of, and as to
other Things speaks only ¹iri the general. Sometimes the Inquisitor pretends 103,
he must go'to some other Place, and shall not return for a long while, and

says that he pities the Prisoner, would expedite his Affair, and so persuades

him to confess·‚ otherwise he must remain in the Jayl in Irons till his Return,
.and he doth not know when that will be, that by this Means the Prisoner may,
thro’ Dread of that direful and wearisom Imprisonment‚ be persuaded to con-·

sess. And indeed in the Book os the Sentences ol the Tholouse Inquisitiori‚ there

are Instances of several, whovhave been continued in Jayl several Years, be-

fore Sentence pronounced against them. And even to this Day the prisonem

are kept many Years in the Prison of the Inquisition, which in Spain, 021¹
especially in Portugal is very dismal, as hath been related, Book 2. Chap. 18.

that they may at length confess. Sometimes the inquisitor multiplies his In· χω,
terrogatories, and teases his Prisoner, that he may confess this or the other ί
Τὴίηὲ,ιοι· may be caught contradicting himself. When this happens, z'ie
Prisoner. is ihewn the Contradiffions in his Answers, and admonished to de-
clare the Truth‚ *or thatiotherwise he will. be put to the Question¹ and Tor-
tures. , And if *he will not confesS, he is, as will be afterwards shewn, by the
Advice of the Learned, actually made to undergo them, that by Torments
they may. draw forth the Truth.

If neither by, 'this Means he can draw out a Confeffion from the Priso- 106.
ner, he treats him more kindly in his Food and Drink, and procures certain
Persons, no. ways suspected concerning the Faith, to go to him, and free-uerit-

]y. to converse with him of several Things, not at ¹all relating ,to itis iltuit,

and at length to persuade him tofhave Confidence in them, and to adviie hiin

80 confess the Truth‚ promising that the Inquisitor shall be favourable to

him, and that they will be Mediators in his Behalf. At length the lnquiii- ρςς-,ιεῖ
tor comes along with them, and promises to lhew him Favour is he will con- - ,
sess the Truth‚ sor all is gracious that is done for the Conversion of Heretick
and even their Penancesare Grace5‚ ,and Remedies.- If -the Person accuset}
by this Means prays for· Favour, and confeffes his Error, the. Inquisitor an-
swers, you shall have much greater Favour than you asked,. but promises ξε
only in general Terms, sor he thinks he fulfils his Prmnise, in shewing the
least Kindness to him afterwards„ And when they promise. to shew Favoni-3
'tis ¹understood only of those Punishrnents, which are left to their own Powtr, ,
viz. -several penitentia] Punishments‚ because they can’t remit those whiczu are
appointed by the Law. They sarther teach, that notwithstanding the Pro·-
rnjise of- such Grace, they may infliet penitentia] :md arbitr-ary Punii'imicnis 3
because, if astera long time, continual Admotum, anti sometimes astet·
the Torture, criminals confess their Offence upon the Promise of such Gracc,

the ¹Inquisitors may legally and jnstly inflict ‚more grievous penitential Puniiha
ments, ,
