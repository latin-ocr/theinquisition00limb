Time into a Monastery‚ and punished with a Fine. In smaller Blasphemies
they are dealt with more gently at the Pleasure of the Inquisitors‚ viz, [he
Blasphemer is condemned to stand, during divine Service, upon some ΗΘΜ--
day or other, with his Head naked, without his Cloak, and Shoes, his Feet
naked‚ a Cord tied round him, and holding a burning VVax—Taper in his.
Hands. Sometimes also they squeeze his Tongue with a Piece of W00d‚
After divine Service is over his Sentence is read, by which he is enjoined Fet,
trinos and a Fine.

‘fhis Punishment however doth not take place as to a Clergyman‚ as Ca-p, 2, t·
rena observes. For if a Clergyman was to appear without his Shoes‚ and5⁴ 17, ‘
with an Halter about his Neck, and thus stand at the Gates of the Church⁷²· 88,
before the People, the Clerical Order, and the Ministry of the Clergy would
suffer Disgrace‚ and it would become the Wonder and evil Example to the
Laity‚ ifthe blaspheming Clergy were thus exposed. He adds, that he ne-
ver saw this Punishment inflicted by this Tribunal on noble Persons, wh0„
altho' they are not to be more mildly punilhed for their Nobility‚ yet may
be excused from such Punishments which do os themselves render Persons in-
famous‚ and receive other Punilhments in the room of them.

And because such who accustom themselves to blaspheme, though they do
it in Paffion‚ are vehemently suspected os Heresy‚ they are forced to abjure
as thus suspefted. Thus Diana relates‚ that in the Inquifition in Sicily, two Resd m„
Blasphemers were made publickly to abjure, as vehemently suspeRaed, Deest-almam,

miesy because they are but lightly suspected, they only abjure as such. refil. 8·

But in these. Cases the Inquifitors mostly a& according to their own Plea-
sure, who have an ample Power of judging according to the Nature and
Heinousness of the Crimes. Gonfhlvius tells us of a certain Person who hadb· 19⁸--
a Qarrel with a Clergyman os Eryce, a City in Spain, who accidently said„⁴ ²
in the Hearing ofotliers, that he could not believe that God would come
down into the Hands of so profligate an Adulterer, . The Vicat of the Oru
dinary fined him for the Speech. But the Clergyman not contentetl with
this Revenge‚ afterwards accused him os Blasphemy at the Tribunal of the
Inquisitors at Se-z‘iffle. Nor did the Fine to which he was before condemned
by the Ordffiary, prevent his being taken up by Command of the Inquisi-
tom, imprisoned sor a whole Year, brought out in Triumph without Cloak
or Har, carrying a Wax-Candle in his Hand, his Tongue gagged with a
wooden Gag, thus to punish his Blasphemy3 and being forced to abjure as
lightly suspected, he was fined a sesond time,
