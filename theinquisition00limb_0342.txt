¹74 The Hrs‘ron‘v of the INQursrrron.

⁶⁶ most part, clear them ofthe Criines objeeted to thern, they are to be ad*
⁶⁶ mitted. But if they are absurd, incredible, or unlikely, and don't agree
⁶⁶ with what goes before, or comes after, nor with the Nature of just speak-
⁶⁶ ing, nor with the Circumstances ofPerfons‚ Times, and Places, they are
⁶⁶ to be rejerfted3 especially when under the Pretence of an Interpretation

*⁶⁶ rthe true Sense of a Proposition is destroyed and corrupted.
Ιξ-’νῒ 12 ⁶⁶ John [ἔργω affirms, That the adjudging of Propofitions partly be-
9..;00‚&c‚.« longs to the Cmonists, and gives us a short Account of the Office
⁶⁶ of the several Affessors, and in what Matters they are to be consulted.
‘⁶ If there be a Doubt whether any Affertion be expressy condemned as he·
⁶⁶ retical‚ the Cognisance of it belongs to those who are ss<ilful in the Canon
⁶⁶ Law ς because Heresies condemned are to be found in the Decretals‚ the Sex-
⁶⁶ tum, the Clementiam, Extra-vagalum, and General Councils. But if such an As-
⁶‘ sertion is not expressy determineti, it belongs to the Interpreters of holy
*⁶⁶ Writ. But it belongs to the Divines to determine concerning the indistinffly
1⁹1st- Mad-⁴⁶ and absolutely received Use and Manner ofevery Propofitiom and from their
⁶⁶· ¹5⁶¹· -⁶⁶ Affertions in judging Causes ofFaith‚ there must be no receding, which al-
‘⁶ so is more fully decreed by the Counsellors of the supreme General Council
‘⁶ of the Inquisition. But the proper Duty and Office ofthe Inquifitors of he-
⁶⁶ retical Pravity‚ >is to observe thejudiciary Order against Hereticks, present
⁶⁶ or absent, in their Apprehenfion, Accusations, Publications of Witnefi‘es‚
*⁶⁶ and in their Senoences, whether definitive or interlocutory‚ with the Advice
⁶⁶ of such Lawyers as are called Counsellors. Of all these Things, the Pro-
⁶⁶ feffors of the sacred Writings are whoily ignorant. Under these Counsel-
⁶⁶ lors Lay Persons married, who are skilful in the Canon and Civil Law,
‘⁶ are comprehended.” This Carencz confirms by his own Example, who
p. 1. t. 8. says of himself, I who am a Judgg, a Conservator of the Rights of the hely Office‚
a ” Counsellor and Advocate Fzstal, am married. But he thinks this is not the Manner
in the Kingdom of Portugal‚ because there the Counsellors have a decifive Vote,

and subscribe to the Sentences.

Pegna However, the Inquifitors are not bound necessarily to follow 'the Advice
σάω. ιἰγ. of the Counsellors ·, but after they have heard their Cpit-don, they are free to
determine what they think proper, though contrary to, or different from
the others Advice3 because their Votes are not decifive, but only by way
of Advice. This also is plain from hence, because, as Camillus Campegius
ij„ zanchsays, ⁶⁶ It may happen, that by the Intreaties of others, they may give ’
eqp. 15. ⁶⁶ wrong Advice, not to say unjust. For the Love of Christ is grown so
⁶⁶ cold, that few are to be found who have God only before their Eyes, in
‘⁶ the Advices they give. For they who defend the Guilty‚ do so perpetual·
‘⁶ ly tire even the Do&ors themselves with their Entreaties‚ that for the most
‘⁶ Part they turn them afide from Justice. Add to this, that the Inquifitors
‘⁶ in Italy are so poor, that they cannot maintain certain and fixed Counsel-

-‘⁶ lors, nor afford them even a small Salary : So that little Care is taken of the
⁴⁶ Affairs ofthis holy Office.''
