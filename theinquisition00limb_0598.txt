mand that he may be made to recant what he preached, and publicklyto change his
.Mind, at least in those Things that are scandalous, and sound «ill, and immedi-
ately declare in what Senfe he undet-stands other doubtful Nlatters rwhich are capable
of different Interpretatiom, that from hencfforward no one may bescandalized, and
that he may be deprived of the Office of Preaching without any Delay.

finally, stncc it may be prestimed, or is presumed from many Things said by him,
and inconsiderately ueteres& that the aforesaid Criminal hat-h poffibly afferted or said
other -Things contrary to the Catholick Faith, and hath believed many other Errors,
as an Herctick and Apostate‚ tho' I do not now accuse him of them, yet Ι intend, in
the Progressof the Cause, to accuse him. Poffibly also he knows other Accomplices
infeffted with Herefies, and defiled with *this or the other, in the Dominions of our
Lord the King, and will not inform against them, least they should be punished. These
also, lastly‚ as far as by Law I can, I denounce and accuse that they may be pu-
etifhed in the same fisanner.

lW³el⁴ef07‘c, I beseech your Lordlhips, that crediting all the aforesaid Matters, or
so much of them as is sufficient, the aforesaid N. may, by your Sentence, be decla-
red and condemned as a relapsed, impenitent, negative, feigned, pretended, con-
feffing, obstinate, perjured, incorrigible Heretick, and that the Punishments ap-
pointed by the common Law, and the pragmatick Laws, and the Instruttz‘ons of this
-holy Office, and any others any ways incurred by him, may be inflitted on him 3
and that finally, according to Custom, he may be delivered over to the secular Arm.
{1²0 this must be added, that the said Criminal is under Excommunication, and ob-
noxious to the same, by which all his Goods‚ moveable and immoveable, any ways
appertaining to him, as also all Deeds and Rights are to be applied and confiscated to
our Lord the King, and finally, that all his-Contrat‘ts are to be absolutely and entirely
annulati, and finally, that all his Children and GrandehilAren, descendingfromshim in
the Male Line, even to the second Generation, :bedeclared unfit, unworthy, and in-
vcapgillieisssfacllaejtlhfffgihighiioit}sDJi}bqutoni’soz'zbfiiaiiisi’iumiiiid confiderately said before this most so-
lemn Tribunal, shall not be so proved by theffi’s as to cause him to be immediately
‚Junished as an Heretick, they are however enough to put him to the Torture, by which
he may be made openly to discover the aforesaid Matters, and to acknowledge the Er-
rors of which he is accused.²

finally, I call God to Witness‚ and this holy Croſs, that I have not formed this
,Accusation out of Hatrecl, or any other evil Affettion of Mind, but with this
View only, that Crimes may be punished, and the Good of the Common-wealth
conffllted‚ and· that herein I may be fiiccessful, I implore this your holy Office.
