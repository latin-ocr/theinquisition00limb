152 The HtsTossv of the INQutstrro N.

concerning that Matter? Who they were that he heard speaking or disputing
of those Things ? Whether he ever discoursed of them? What he hath be-
lieved, and doth now believe about Purgatory ? If he anstvers, that his Faith
concerning it hath been right, and denies any ill Belief‚ but that he believes
as holy Mother Church believes and teaches, he is order'd to say what the ho-
lyiRomcm Mother Church doth think and believe concerning this Article.

When he hath given in his Answer he is admonished to consider well and
tell the Truth‚ and to beware of lying, because the contrary is proved by
VVitnesses against him, viz. that speaking of Purgatory, he said such and such
Things·‚ and then they recite the VVords which the Denouncer and Witness
have deposed were spoken by him. And thus he is succeffively in the same
or another Examination interrogated in the same manner concerning the se-
veral Articles for which he is denounced: As, whether he said, that simple
Fornication is no Sin, that 'tis lawful to invocate Devils, and offer Sacrifices
to them, and the like. All these Things the Notary receives, as in the first
Examination‚ and the Prisoner subscribes them.

If the Prisoner’s Answers don’t agree with his former Answers, he is exami-
ned again and again, and, as shall hereafter be shewn‚ they proceed to farther
Remedies. And whatever the Popish Doctors may write, [they who have
been in the Prison of the Inquisition with one Mouth, complain] that they are
left in Uncertainty for a long while, what are the Crimes of which they are
accused ς and that the Inquisitors would willingly draw from their own Mouths
a Confeffion of Crimes to which they are not conscious. And this is cun-
ningly invented for this Reas0n‚ that if any Person should have happened to
have spoken any thing not agreeable to the Roman Faith, and ofwhich poffi-
bly he is not accused, he may discover those Things als0‚ because he is un·
certain of what Crime he is accused, on Account of that horrid Silence which
is there observed3 or that he may accuse himself falsely of certain Things
to free himself from that dreadful Jayl. So that they all affirm their Accu-
sations are not discovered to them till after a long Confinement‚ that so being
broken and tired out with a continued and horrible Imprisonrnent‚ they may
confess of themselves Things that never came into their Minds.

If the Prisoner knows the Reason of his being apprehended, and openly
confeffes every Thing oswhich he hath been accused to the Inquisitor, he is
commended, and encouraged to hope for a speedy Deliverance. If he con-
feffes some ThingS, but can't guess at others, he is commended for taking up
thePurpose of accusing himself, and exhorted by the Bowels of Mercy of Je-
sus Christ, to proceed, and ingenuoussy to confess every Thing else of which
he is accused, that so he may experience that Kindness and Mercy, which this
Tribunal uses towards those, who manifest a real Repentance of their Crimes

Armet. 1b, by a sincere and voluntary Confeffion. lf the Case doth not relate to formal
Heresy‚ but to some certain kind of Fortune-telling, or heretical Word, and
the Prisoner confeffes the A& or Word, but denies the heretical Intention‚
the Inquisitors use all their Endeavours to draw from him also a Confeffion.
And first they enquire, whether that Fa& or Word was committed once, or

oftener ?
