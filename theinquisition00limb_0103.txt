lf we look into our own Country we shall find numerous Prot->fs cf thecfffl-

seen the Flames which the Papists had kindled against their Brethren, yet
lighted Fires themselves to consume those who differed from rhem. Cranmer’s
Hands were sta'ined with the Blood os several. He had a Share in the Prose-
cution and Condemnation ofthat pious and excellent Martyr John Lambert ;Burne:'s
and consented [ο [ᾖε Death of Am ἅψεα, who were burnt sor denying the cor- HJst Ref.
poral Presence, which, thoughCms-zmer then believed, he saw afterwards rea-‘02 11. ῖ-

siastical Opinions about Christ, and delivered over to the secular Power.

The Sentence being returned to the Council, King Edawrd Vl. was moved to

fign a Warrant for her being burnt, but could not be prevailed with to do it.

Cramer endeavoured to persuade him by such Arguments as rather silenced

than satisfied the young King. So he set his Hand to the Warrant with Tears

in his Eyes, saying to the Archbishop, that if he did wrong, fince it was in³
Submiffion to his Authority, he should answer for it to God. Though [ᾖίε7
struck Cranmer with Horror, yet he at last put the Sentence in Execution

against her. About two Years after one George Van Pare, a Dutch Man, was

accused before them, for saying, That God the Father was only God, and

that Christ was not very God, And though he was a Person ofa very holy

Life, yet because he would not abjure‚ he was condemned for Heresy, and

burnt in Smithfield. The Archbishop himselfwas afterwards burnt for Heresy,

which, as Fox observed‚ many looked on ajust Retaliation from the Provi-

dence of God, for the cruel Severities he had used towards others.

The Controversy about the Popish Habits was one ofthe first that arose
amongst the English Reformers. Cranmer and Ridley were zealous for the Use
of them, whilst other very pious and learned Divines were for laying them
afide, as the Badges os Idolatry and Antichrist. Amongst these was Dostor
Hooper, nominated to the Bissioprick os Glocester 3 but because he refused to be
consecrated in the old Vestments‚ he was, by Order of Council first filenced,
and then confined to his own House·, and afterwards, by Cranmer’s Means,
committed to the Fleet prison, where he continued several Months.

In the beginning of Qeen Elizabeth's Reign, A. C. 1559. an A& passed ἐξίει-,ς
sor the Uniformity of Common· Prayer‚ and Service in the Church, and Ad-Eliza'oeth‚
ministration of the Sacramenrs, by which the Qeen and Biihops were empow—
red to ordain such Ceremonies in Worship, as they should think for the Ho-
nour os God, and the Edification of his Church. This A& was rigorously
preffed, and great Severities used to such as could not comply with it. Parker
Archbishop of Canterbury‚ made the Clergy subscribe to use the prescribed
Rites and Habits, and cited before him many of the most famous Divines who
scrupled them, and would allow none to be presented to LivingS‚ or preferred

in the Church, without an intire Consorrnity. He summoned the whole Body}
