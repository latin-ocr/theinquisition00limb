‘234 The H1 sToRY ofthe INQmsxron..

However‚ in very important Castu, the Sentence of the Inquisitors5 ordinary and
Counsellors, though they all agree. shall nothe put in Execution‚ without consulting the
Senate‚ according to Custom and Order.
Qu, 51, When the Bishop and Inquifitor proceed separately‚ so that there are two·
’ Proceffes carried on for the same F aet, one by the Bishop, and the other by
the Inquisltor‚ they ought to communicate their Proceffes to one another.
Cap.per Bnt that theshicl Affair of the Inqntfition may proceed better, more effebl‘ually and pro-⁷
²³0⁶· 35- Vrftaoty, we grant, that the Bishops ancl Inquifitors may make Inquifitionvconcerningk
amn. de the simne Hm, either together or apart. ff they proceedfhparately‚ they (hall be ob?
arec. 1‘6‘liged mntnally to communicate the Proceffi’s, that herehy the Truth may be the better
found ont. Am] unless in this Caso the Inquifitors shall think fit to refer the
‘prononncing -S'entence to the Dim-esans, or the Dioccfizns to the Inquzfitors, let them
both join in paffing it. If they cannot agree in pronouncing it, let them draw up a full
Account of ths Cafh, and refer it to the Apostolick ὅτε.
Q, 5, This Communication osche Proceffes is to be made only once, and that when-
Ex.'e0.³' the Process is linissied. By an Extravagant of Benedicfft. XI. which says:
When they both procem?„Atbparatelffi they must at the Endos the Process‚ when nothing
remains hut only to pronounce Sentence, communicate it to each other. One Cast? how« ἢ
ever-we excep& viz. if either of them cannot conveniently proceed, without fis’eing
what the other »bath donst In this Case let a Capyos the whole Proceedure be grant—-
ed, though hul one, to prevent any Fraud.
Caren. But in Spain and Portngal the Inquisitors only form the ProceffeS, and ap-
p. 1. tit.4.prehend Criminals in Cause's ofthe Faith, and if the Bishops have any Infor-
55. 21· mations against such Criminals‚ they must transmit them to the Inquifi-tors„
But it is uncertain whether these Spanish Inquifitors claim this· by any legal
Custom and Prescription‚ or by the Pope’s Privilege.

These are the Things to be observed‚ when the Ordinary and Inquifitor
concur in vhe Judgment of the Faith. But because oftentimes in>- Spain se-
veral Inquisitors are deputed together, it will be proper to consider how fars
each of them may separately proceed.

Qu. 46. As often therefore as it happens that two Inquifitors are constituted in the i
¹ ⁰121· 95· same province, they may both together, or each of them separately‚ proceedi
against Hereticks throughout the whole Province committed to them, s1t im.

Judgm ent in any Part of it, and when the Executor is absent create another„
because they have entire Jurisdiftion. However, a Criminal can be punished

only by one of them. But if there be any special Inquifitor deputed against'

any Person by the Pope‚ the Inquifitors of Provinces and Dioceses, who, as
general Judges‚ seem to have universal Jurisdistion, at least with respect to,-
Persons, cannot proceed against him, though they have actually began the
Process ·‚ because their Jurisdiffion is suspended by a special Commiffion grant-

ed by the Pope. He who is thus constituted special Inquifitor, may make

use of ever-y Thing that hath been done and discovered by the other Inquisn'-

tors, whom if it be necessary he may compel to deliver to him all the Pro-o

ceffes, WritingS, Inquisitions‚ Depofitions of WitneffeS, and alliother Things

they have discovered against* any Criminal„ Although 'tis reckoned lipoge
