The HLSTORY of the INQmsn-on.

and Princes, but by Bis'nops and Divines, who strenuoussy wrote in their Defence‚ ,
This spirited up many others to oppose that unbounded Authority, which the
Popes affumed in Matters of Faith, who not only argued that they were ca·-
pable oferring, as well as the other Bishops, but actually pointed out and cen-
sured their many Errors and Abuses of their unlitnited Power : All these the
Court of Rome branded with the infamous Name of Here-tiela, and would,
have made the Sacrifice to the publick Hatred.

They appeared first in some Parts of Italy, but principally in the Milaneze
and Lombardy .· And because they dwelt in different Cities, and had their par-
ticular Instrtic‘tors, the Papists, to render them the more odious‚- have -
represented them as different Ξεξὶς, and ascribed to them as different Opi-
nions, though others affirm they all held the same Opinions‚ and were entirely
of the same Sed. The Truth is, that from the oldest Accounts of. them?
we shall find, that they did not all hold the same TenetS, and were not·-
of the same Se6l3 though neither their Opinions nor Sects were so many and ,,
different as the Papists represent. The Principal of them were ‘Tanchelimen¹

peared at Lyons, whose Original hath been largely shewn by the most
Reverend and Learned Lssaer, Archbishop of Armagh‚ in his Book De Suc-
cffone, &tx ch. viii. I shall therefore only enquire‚ whether the Valdenses and
Albigenses were the same People‚ according to the common Opinion of Pro-
testants‚ or different from one another. It cannot be doubted but that they*-
had some Opinions in common. But there is nothing more evident, than
that there was amongst them a great Variety os Doctrines‚ and Difference of*
Rites and Customs, as appears from the Book of the Sentences of the Inqui-
fition at Tholcust’, which I· have publish'd‚ in which are to be found many of the
Sentences pronounced against the Albigenſss and Valdenfhs, which discover
some very curious and uncommon Things‚ concerning their Doetrines and·
Rites ·, and which are such evident Proofs of their difference in Opinions and
Customs‚ that from the reading of a few> LineS, one may easily know wsse-
