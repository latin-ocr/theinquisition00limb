Pie‘lures, or Reprffentations 0f GM, 05⁴ Of Christ, or of the Vz'rgin Mary‚ or of
any of the Saints, condemning it as a vain and diabolical Invention 3 depostng all Bi-
sho'ps, and subjee‘i'z‘ng the [Monks aad Laity, who should set up any of them in pub-
lick or private, to all the Penaltiesof the imperial Cos-istitutions. They also depo-
sed Constantine, Patriarch of Constantinople, for oppofing this Decree 3 and the
Emperor first banished him, and afterwards put him to Death ς and command-
ed, That this Council should be 'esteemed and received as ‘the seventh oecu-
menical‚ or universal one. Paul Ι. Pope of Rome, sent his Legate to Con-Platin in
stantinople, to admonish the Emperor to restore the sacred Images and Statuesv1t.Pau11.
which he had destroy'd ; and threatened him with Excommunication upon his
Refusal. But Copronymus slighted the Meffage, and treated the Legates with
great Contem pt, and used the Image W'orlhippers with a great deal of Severity.

Constantine, Bisnop of Rome, the Successor of Paul, seems also to have been
an Enemy to ImageS, and was there tumultuoussy deposed, and Stephe12111.{d·fflvif·
substituted in his Room, who was a wart-n and furious Defender of them. He stephana.
immediately assembled a Council in the Lateran Church, where the holy Fa-
thers abrogated all Constantine's Decrees 3 deposed all that had beenordained by
him Bithops, made void all his Baptisms and Chrisms 3 and as some Historians
relate, after having beat him, and used him with great Indignity‚ made a
Fire in the Churc'n, and burnt him therein. After this, they annulled all the
*Decrees of the Synod of Constantinople, ordered the Restoration of Statues and
Images, and anathematized that execrahle and pernicious Synod, giving this
excellent Reason for the Use of Images‚ That if 'twas lawfulfor Emporon, and
thoste who had deserved well of the Commonwealth, to have their Images ereded, but
:not lawful to set up thos! of God·‚ the condition of the immortal God would be worse
ethan that ofMen. After this the Pope published the aas of the Council, and
pronounced an Anathema against all those who should oppose it.

Thus the Mystery of this Iniquity worked, till at length, under the Reign osrheseventb
Irene and Constantine her Son, a Synod was packed up of such Bishops as weregeneral
ready to make any‘ Decrees that should be agreeable to the Roman Pontiff‚⁶⁰¹‘'³⁶²'³
and the Empress. They met at Nice, to the Number of about 350. In this A'C‘
venerable Affembly it was decreed, That hely Imag'es of the Croſs should be con-
secrated‚ and put on the sacred Veffiels and Vestments‚ ancl upon Walls and Boards,
*in private Houses and publick Ways ς and especially that there should be ereo‘ted Ima-

sume³ to think or teach oth‘grw’ifia or to throw away any paintedssBoois, or ‘the Frigore
of the Cross, or any Image or Pil'lure, or any genuine Relie‘ls of the stlartym, they
fh⁰u³⁷d⁷ if Bishops ΟΥ Clergymffla be dePOsess σν if Monks or Laymen, be excommuni-
cated. Then they pronounced Anathemas upon all who should not receive
Images‚ or who should apply what the Scriptures say against Idols, to the
holy lmages, or who should call them Idols, or who should wilfully commu·
-nicate with those who reje&ed and despised them 3 adding, according to Cu-
·storn, Long live Constantine and Irene his Mother. Damnation to all Hereticks.

Damnation on the Council that roared against venerable lmages. 7798 holy Trinity
