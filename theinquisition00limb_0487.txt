punished‚ as above, and after the same Manner as those who wound them ς
for this is not left to the Pleasure of the Inquifitors or Ordinaries by the Mat-
ter of this Bull, but to the Cardinals, the supream Inquifitors‚ to whom it
belongs to declare, whether Criminals have incurred the Penalties of this Con⁴

' ' r not.
ἃιῐΙι-Ιῐῑειεοὲἰέῑεοε us another Instance that happened at Cremona, An. 1592. A cer*
tain Person had accused all the Witneffes examined against him in the holy
Office, and had caused them to be imprisoned by the secular Judge for sun-
dry Crimes and Damages which they and their Cattle had occafioned in 1155
Grounds. The major Part of the Congregation at Cremona thought, that
although the Accusation could not be called formally that terrifying of
which the Bull speaks, yet inasmuch as it appeared flanderous and deceitful,
the Criminal should be obliged to free the imprisoned Witness'es from jayl at
his own Expence, and pay them, when delivered, all their Charges.

This takes place, not only when any Person is accused as an Heretick‚§, 17·
‘⁶ but in all and every Cause whatsoever belonging to tlie holy Office ·‚ be·
“ cause every Cause belonging to this Tribunal‚ is properly said to be a Cause
“ of the Faith, and to belong to it, and to infer some Mark of the Faith,
“ either direffly or indireffly. And in all Causes of this holy Office there is
“ the same Reason for maintaining the Liberty of this Tribunal‚ Thus in
“ the Year 1635. a certain Neopolz'tan Soldier had rescued from the Sbirrz· a
“ certain Blasphemer‚ taken up in the Name of the holy Office, for whi‘ch
‘⁶ he was condemned by Order of the supream Tribunal of the City to all
“ the Penalties of this Constitution. Altho’ afterwards, through the Fa-
“ vour ofthe said supream Tribunal‚ the Punishment ofDeath was exchanged
“ for that of the Gallies for ten Years. And this was publickly executed at
“ Cremona, in the Hall of the holy Office.'’

Yea, they extend this Affair sometimes so far, that all manner of Offences
committed against any one that belongs to the Inquifitors, though they have
no Relation to the Faith, are punished in the same Manner, as though the
Office of the Inquifition had been hindered by them, or the inquisitor him-
self had received some grievous Injury. Reginald Gonsalvius gives us a re·p‘ ¹91·
markable Instance ofthis which happened in the former Age at Seville. The
Bishop ofTerragone, chief Inquisitor at Seville, went one Summer for his Di-
verfion to some pleasant Gardens fituate by the Sea Side, with all his
Inquisitory Family, and walked out, according to his Custom, with his E-
piscopal Attendance. A Child of the Gardener, two or three Years old at
most, accidentally sat playing upon the Side of a Pond in the Garden,
where my Lord Bishop was taking his Pleasure. One of the Boys that at*
tended his Lordship‚ snatch'd out of the Hand of the Gardener’s Child a Remi,
with which he was playing‚ and made him cry. The Gardener hearing his
Child, comes to the Place, and when he found out the Occasion of his
