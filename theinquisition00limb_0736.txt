which, when they have got the Confeffion‚ they don’t believe themselves obe
liged to fulfil 3 and to get them by artful and evafive Interrogatories to declares?-
that the informers and Witneffes are not their mortal Enemies3 that so the
Prisoner being destitute ofall human Affistance and Comfort, and seeing no End
to his Miseria, may, thro’ the Art and Fraud ofthe Inquifitor, have no poffible
way left to defind himself. And yet in the mean while these Wretches affe&
the Appearance of Justice, and grant the Criminals an Advocate and Procura-
tor to manage their Cause. But in this the Prisoner is miserably deceived.

IX. And this is a ninth Specimen of their Injustice, because the Advocate
granted to him is given him only to betray him. For he may not choose
such an Advocate as he himself approves of, nor is it lawful fori the Advo-
cate to defend the Prisoner, unless he would be accounted as a Favourer of‘
Heresy ·, but the Inquisition it self affigns him his Advocate, bound to thern
by an Oath‚ whose principal Business is to persuade the Criminal to*
confess the Crime he is accused of, not to use any Methods of De-
fence not pinctised in the Court or the Inquifition‚ and immediately tor„
quit his Defence‚ if he can’t defend him according to the Laws of the‘
Inquisitien. Belides, the Defences they use are mere Trifles and Impostures,
by which they miserably deceive the Prisoners, so that tho' they seem to be
endeavouring to do a great deal, they in Reality do nothing at all 3 but only
observe afew Fosi-05, vthat t-he Process in the mean while may be prepared
and finilhed, according to the Custorn observed in the Inquifition.

X. A tenth is, that when the Crimes cannot be proved against the Prisonen.
he is not absolved from the Crime of which he is accused, but only from Pro-
secution ·, and all the Declaration that is made is, that the Crime against him
is not proved by proper Witneffes ·, and this Sentence is never taken for anx
adjudged Case. So that he who is once informed against to the Inquifition,
altho' he be innocent, and his Crirne can’t be proved according to the recei-
ved Manner of the Inquifition‚ tho' indeed, according to that Manner, all..
Crimes, of which there is but the least Suspicion‚ may be easily proved 3 yet
heis never blotted out of the Inquifitors Book or Inde-x, but his Name is
there preserved in perpetual Remembrance of his being a suspected Person,
that if he should happen to be informed against for Heresy at any othertime,
these latter lnformations added to the former may amount to a real Proos,
and thataltho’ he is dismissed from Jayl by the Sentence of the Judge, he·
:may never be able to live in Sasety, but that being· always suspected by the
Inquisitor‚ he may be arrested for the same Crime which ought to have been.
{orgotten⁹ upon the fresh Information of some vile and wicked Fellow,

XI. An eleventh, and that not the least instance ofilnjustice, is, their*
Readiness to put Persona to the Torture, and that to discover a. secret Crime,
lying concealed in the Mind·‚ yea, that they will use the Torture somuch
the sooner, because theCrime is-more concealed than other Crimes. ’Τίς
