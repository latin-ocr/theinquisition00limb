for Diffi>rence5 (gf Opiniotz in Matters os Religion ·, and that he would coest’nt to an
Ab? of Parlmment for the full granting that Indulgence. But other Measures soon
prevailed. In the second Year after his Rt-storatiom the Aet of Uniformity
was passed, by which all Ministers were to read, and pzlblickly declare mzfeigned
Affent [md Consent to all (md every Thing contained in, and prescribed by the Book of
Common Prayer, before the Feast of St. Bartholome-w, then ensuing‚ under the
Penalty of immediate and absolute Deprivation. The Consequence of this
A& waS, that between two and three thousand excellent Divines were turned
„out of their Churches3 many ofthem, to say the least, as eminent for Learn-
ing and Piety as the B3sliops, who were the great Promoters of this barbarous
Aer, ancl themselves and Faunum, many of them, exposed to the greatest
'Distress and Poverty. This cruel Injustice obliged the ejee‘ted Minister-s, and
their Frienils, to set up separate Congregations‚ and occasioned such a Divifion
{rom the established Church, as will, 1 hope, ever rein-ain, to witness against
the Tyranny of those Times, and the reverend Authors and Promoters of that
Aet, to maintain the Spirit and Praetice of serious Religion, and as a publick

-tho’ several ofthe ejeeted Ministers shewed their Piety and Courage‚ in staying
,and preaching in the City during the Fury of it, the five Mile A& was passed a-
gainst them the next Year, at Oxforcl3 by which, all the filenced Ministers were
obliged to take an Oath, that it was not lawful, on any Pretence whatsoever,
to take Arnis against the King, or any commiffion’d by him ·, and that they
would not, at any time, endeavour an Alteration in the Governrnent of
Church and State. Such who scrupled the Oath, were forbid to come within
rfive Miles ofany City or Parliament Burrough, or of the Church where tfhey
