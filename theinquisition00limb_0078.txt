quarrelled on this Account, and divided into several PartieS, Justin ordered the

Bishop to be apprehended, and his Tongue to be cut out, and commanded that

the Synod ofChalcedon should be preached up through all the Churches of the

In vit. Empire. Platizm also tells υς, that he banished the Arians, and gave their

J0h³⁰·¹· Churches to the Orthodox, Hormisda also, Bishop of Rome, in imitation of

Platin. his Predeceffor Symmachus, banished the Remainder os the Manichees, and cau—
sed their Writings to be burnt.

Evag.l.3. Justinian‚ his Successor in the Empire, succeeded him also in his Zeal for ’

Μ’· the Council of Chalcedon, and banished the Bishops of Constantinople and Antioch, ”

because they would not obey his Orders, and receive the Decrees ofthat Synod.

He also publissied a Constitution‚ by which he anathematized them and all

their Followers, and ordered, that whosoever should preach their Opinions

should be subje& to the most grievous Punishments. By this means nothing

was openly preached in any os the Churches but this Council ς nor did any one

dare to anathematize it. And whosoever were of a contrary Opinion, they

were compelled by innumerable Methods to come into the Orthodox Faith.

P‘ffst' In the third Year of his Reign he published a Law, ordering that there should

“8⁸²⁸ be no Pagans, nor Hereticks‚ but orthodox Christians only, allowing to He-

c. ¹ ⁸ reticks three Months only for their Conversion. By another he deprived He-

Cod. de reticks of the Right of Succeffion‚ By another he rendered them incapable of

Haeret. being Witnesses in any Trial against Christians. He prohibited them also

Novel.42.from baptizing any Persons, and from transcribing heretical Books under

⁶· ¹· the Penalty of having the Hand cut off. These Laws were principally

owing to the Persuafions of the Bishops. Thus Agapetus, Bishop of Rome,

who had condemned Anthimus, and deposed him from his See of Constantinople,

persuaded Justinian to banish all those whom he had condemned for Heresy.

Platin. Pelagius also destred, that Hereticks and Schismaticks might be punished by

the secular Power, if they would not be converted. The Emperor was too

ready to comply with this Advice. But notwithstanding all this Zeal sor Or-

thodoxy, and the cruel Ediets published by him for the Extirpation of Heresy,

Evag. l.4.he was infamoussy Covetous, sold the Provinces of the Empire to Plunderers

‘- 30· and Oppreffors, stripped the Wealthy of their Estates upon false Accusations

and sorged Crimes, and went Partners with common Whores in their Gains of

Prostitution ; and what is worse, in the Estates of those whom those Wretches

falsely accused of Rapes and Adultery. And yet, that he might appear as-

Pious as he was Orthodox, he built out of these Rapines and Plunders many

stately and magnificent Churches·‚ many religious Houses for Monks and

o. 3²· Nuns, and Hospitals for the Relief of the Aged and Infirm. Evagrius also

· charges him with more than bestial Cruelty in the Case of the Venetiam, whom

he not only allowed, but even by Rewards encouraged to murther their Ene-

mies at Noon-day, in the very Heart of the City, to break open HouseS, and
