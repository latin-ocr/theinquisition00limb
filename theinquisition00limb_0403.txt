the same Cause. For which Reason the Inquifitors ofother Provinces must send

their Testimonies, and all Things they have discovered against the Criininals,

to that Inquifitor who first began the Process. ·

The elder Inquifitor is to be preferred, although transsated from one Pro-12¹2. 34
vlnce to another, unless he may have been deprived of his Office, and after· §. ιο,

T ime. This is fully contained in one of the Letters of the Inquifitor Ge*
neral.

J„ Royas hath fully explained this Matter, viz. how several Inquifitors in onepart ts
Province, and how the Inquifitors and Ordinary must ast, and given in the§·439·
Reasons why. “ The jurisdiction of the Inquifirors is mutual and entire,

“ where one of them only prefides over the Jurisdizstion for determining the
“ Causes of the Faith; for a Colleague in any City or Territory hath no
“ Power in Causes already decided. 4 Instrubl. ‘T olet. c. 1. But if they are all
“ present, neither of thern without the other can proceed to apprehend Cri-
“‘ minals‚ to the Publication of Witneffez to the Torture, to enjoin canoni-
“ cal Purgation, or to pronounce any definitive Sentence. And as to the Or-
“ dinaries, such of them as are Inquisitors have a cumulative Jurisdiffion, and
“ not a privative one, in these Articles only 3 viz. in pronouncing Sentences,
“ of Torture, and in other definitive Sentences, as well as in those which arise 444.
“ from the Judgment it self. But in all other Articles the Inquifitors have priva-
'“ tive and n'ot cumulati-ve Jurisdiction. For as to other civil and crimina] Causes
“ not touching the F aith, the Inquifitors may proceed without the Biihop, be-
“ cause the Cogn'isance of them belongs to them rather by the Royal than the
“ Apostolick Authority·² or else by daily Custom, as particularly in the King-
‘¹ doms of Valencz‘a, Aragmi, and Principality of catalonia, which Custom gives
“ them their Jurisdidftion?² Royas adds, ‘⁶ I am grieved and aihamed to tell

Finally, they observe, that ’tis much safer for the Bishops to send to the carena,
