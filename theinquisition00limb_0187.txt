Study that deprives Men of Sincerity [md common Setis& Let us not imagine, that

these Things are not equally true of the ancient, as well as of the modern
DivineS. He that but dips into the Αὲὶε of the ancient Councils, and Ec-
clefiastical Remains‚ will evidently see, that they had the same Paffions with

those of our own Time, were equally precipitant in condemning, bitter in
reproaching, and violent in persecuting those they call’d Hereticks. Socrates
writes of the Bishops of his own Time, That their mamzer was, to laad with Hiflfflccl.

‘ff their Impiety. When they write against their Adversaries, their Stile is
oftentimes bitter3 an Impotency of Mind that many have observed in the
principal and most celebrated Authors. Erafinus, tho' he highly commends
Jerome, hath several Times observed the same in him. In his Apology to
..Martin Dorpius, he thus writes of him: Even Jerome, a Man so grave androm. 9.

Irenicum of Partem, p. 14. He that turns over the Writings of St. Jerome against
Jovinian, Vigilantius, and Ruffinus, will be amaz'd to see in a Monk such a
boiling and bitter Gall. Upon which Account Budaeus pleasantly writes to
Erasmus .· Who knows, but that for this Reaſsm he may be brought and scoztrgedErasmi,

Man, how difficult it is to govern ones self in theological Debates‚ when

we see Men, famous for their Piety, thus carried away by the Heat of
Disputes. The Moderation of Austin is generally commended: But he

that reads his VVritings against the Donatists, must acknowledge, that in the
Warmth of Disputation he oftentimes exceeds the Bounds of Moderation,

and lays to their Charge every thing that came uppermost. Athanastus's
Epistle to the Monks is Proof enough of his ungovernable and angry Tem-

per, in which we find nothing but foul and reproachful Language against
the Ariam3 a plain Proof of a violently disorder'd Mind. 1 qffestion not
but that he had weighty Reasons for his Anger and Hatred. But ’tis as cer-
tain, that when the Mind is disorder’d‚ tho' for the most just Cause‚ many
Things are rashly thrown out, the Effe& of Choler, and not agreeable to
Truth: So that 'tis by no Means safe, {1321stin to credit, all that the an·
