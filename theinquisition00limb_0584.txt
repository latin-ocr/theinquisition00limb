What Arts the IN Qr 1 s 1 T 011}ssst to draw a Coaegfeffion from· the...
rz oners.

Peg a H E S E Examinations and Admonitions are repeated by the Inquifi--
prax. ¹· 2· tots, as often as they think fit, sor they are not bound to any cei-tamn
“ ¹9³ Number. But in these Examinations the Inquisitors use the greatest Artifice,.
’ to draw from the Prisoners Confeffions of those Crimes of which they are ac·
cused. And altho’ they say that the Inquisition makes use rather of Prudence:
than Art, yet they suggest several Orders and Artifices which must be used„

and which they generally use in making Inquisition.

F irst, they observe this exafi‘cl y, that as osten as the Criminals are judicially÷
interrogated, they must so often touch the holy Scriptures, svvearing that,
they will declare the Truth‚ so that an Oath always precedes the Depofition..
The same also is observed as to the Witnefi‘es. Yea, if the Examination„
should be broke off, and what follows should be onlya Continuation of the
former, they must first take an O-ath before· they are suffered to proceed.
Resides, the Inquifitors always admonish and exhort the Criminals, τοι εοω-,
sess simply, fully and truly‚ whatsoever. they have done aga-instlrthe Catholick;
Faith‚ and especially to take Care that they don't bear false Witness either»

cap, 20. against themselves, or any others.. They must not givethem Occafion to be·-
have indecently or rudely,⁴ or to utter Reproaches3 neither must they pro-
mise them Impunity or entire Deliverance, whilst they are endeavouring to
draw a Confeffion from their Mouths, least they should proveLiars, by. proe-
mifingwhat poffibly they may not be able to perform, on least the Criminals<¹
under this Hope should consess Things which perhaps they never committed.

They must not be negligent and slothful in omitting such Interrogatories‚-2
as belong to the Cause it self‚ and the Articles brought into Judgment3 nor:
must they be too troublesome and imprudent, by putting impertinent Inter-
rogatories‚ which don’t relate >to the Cause. But if the Criminal gives Ocea--
fion to ask other Questions by his Answer to such Interrogatories as are.
founded upon legal Prooss‚ if they are not altogether trifling and foreign to:
the Cause, he may be interrogated upon them, because he himself gave Oen
cafion for them in his Answer. And thus sometimes, as they say, it happens
in this Tribunal, that from the—Answers of the Criminals they begin. to make
great Discoveries.

But particular Care must be taken, that the Witneffes who depose against}
the Criminal, may not be discovered by the Interrogatories‚ in Favour of the
Faith, least the Criminals should conspire against them, whereby few would be v
found to denounce Hereticks, or suspe&ed Persons, or to give Testimony ει·-
