the Inquifition to Naples subject to their supreme Council, and the Court of
Rome is equally determined to oppose these Atternpts of the Spaniards ς hence
it is that the Kingdom of Νηρίς] is to this Day free from this intolerable Yoke:
And therefore, if any Matters of Faith are to be judged there, it is done
either by the Bissiop, or some other Prelate appointed by the Court of Rome,
who nevertheless dares not begin the Affair without Leave first obtained

from the Viceroy.

lib. 2. ιι. Γ· HE Inquifition had been long before brought into Sicily. Paramus gives
cap, 11. us a Privilege of King Alphonsun in the Year 1452. in which Mention
‘⁴⁷ is made of Friar Henry Lugardi, a Predicant of Palermo, and Inquifitor of he-
retical Pravity in that Kingdom ·, by which he confirmed the Privilege gi-
ven to him by the foresaid Inquifitor, which Frederick the Emperor had
granted to the Inquifition in Sicily, at Patermo, in the Year 1224. By this
Privilege Frederz'ck is said to have ordained, That one third Part only ofthe con-
fiscated Goods should be appropriated to the Treasttry3 a third Part reserved to the Apo-
ι stolick See, [md the other third, without any Contradittion, affigm’d to the Inquisttors,
that the spiritual Hushctndman may not be defrauded of his Re‘wctrd, nor st> wholfitme
att Inquzfition come to nothing through want of Neceſjaries to support it. From
whence Paramus infers, that the Inquifition was brought into Sicily, An. 1224.
But this Privilege is liable tojust Suspicion, unless there be an Error as to the
Year. For Ι have shewn before, that the Inquifitors had no Tribunals granted
them any where at that Time 3 andI [hall hereafter prove, that the Distribution
of the forfeitedEffects into three Parts, did not take Place till several Years after.
But whatever becomes of this Privilege, 'tis certain that the Inquisition was
establissi'cl in Sicily,An. 1452. and whether this Privilege of Frederick was genuine
or forged, it was confirmed by King Alphonsus. It was afterwards confirmed
by Ferrlinand and Elizctheth, An. 1477. at Sevz‘lle, who took the Title of King
and Qeen of Sicily, though John, King of Aragon, and F ather of Ferdinand,
was yet alive. This Inquifition the Emperor Chorles V. favoured with
many Privilege33 the Patents for which, Paramus gives us in a long Ca-
talooue.
InDthe Year 1535. an Official was sent by the. Inquisitors, to the Town of ’
St. Marte, to apprehend certain Hereticks ·, but he was affaulted by Matthew
Garrubcz, and a large Company with him, who killed many ofhis Attendants,
and gave the Officia} himself many Wounds, and left him halfdead on the
Ground.. The Nobles also of Palermo, and the other Inhabitants of the King-

dom forced the inquisitor by Threats, to depart‚ and made him go on Board
