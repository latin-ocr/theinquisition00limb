“ Ruihes, it rather cncreased her Misery than gave 1161· Rest, so that she

“ outward Kindness, 1116 endeavoured to comfort her Minu with great Ten· ²
‘⁶ derness. The Girlhad scarce began to recover 110111 1161 Torture, when
“ Bol‘quwia was carried out to the same Exercise, and was tortured with such
‘⁶‘ diabolical Cruelty upon the Rack, that the Rope pierced and cut into the
“ verv Bones of her ArmS, Thighs, and Legs‚ and in this Manner she was
“ brought back to Prison, just ready to expire, the Blood immediately
“ running out of her Mouth in great Plenty. Undoubtedly they had burst
‘⁶ her BowelS‚ insomuch that the eighth Day after her Torture she died.
“ And when after all they could not procure sufficient Evidence to condemn
“ her, tho’ fought after and procured by all their Inquifitorial Arts, yet as
‘⁶ the accul'ed Person was born in that Place, where they were obliged to
“ give some Account of the Affair to the People, and indeed could not by
‘⁶ any Μ6305 diffemble it, in the first A& of Triumph appointed after her
‘³ Deam, they commanded her Sentence to be pronounced in these Words.
“ Because this Lady died in Prison, without Doubt suppreffing the Causes of
“ it, and was found to be innocent upon inspecting and diligently examining
‘⁶ her Cause, therefore the holy Tribunal pronounces her 1166 from all Char-⁷
“ ges brought against her by the Fiscal, and absolving 1161 from any 13111161·

“⁶ commands all her Effeets which had been confiscated, to be restored to
“ those to whom they of Right belonged, &a And thus after they had
“ murthered 1161 by Torture with savage Cruelty, they pronounced her ’10-

¹¹⁰⁶ by this Μ6305 secret Matters were oftentimes divulged, and great Incon-
veniencies to the Faith arose from hence, they afterwards thought it more
convenient and wholesome, that the whole Cognisance and full Discuffion of
these Crimes‚ which are merely Ecclefiastical‚ should be confined to the In-
quisitors. And as this could not ostentirnes be done without the Qestion,
'tw-as therefore provided, that the Inquifitors and Bishops might torture Cri-
