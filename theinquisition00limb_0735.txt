The H1sromr of the INQUISITION. 3³3

‘Defence against them upon a bare Suspicion. In -the mean while the Inquisitor
is to judge, whether the Prisoner weakens or destroys the Credit of the witness,
Ifhe cannot destroy the Evidence‚ altho’ he be the most innocent Person, al-
tho' he protests that he is a Catholick‚ and will die in the Faith of the Church
of Rome, yet he can't escape being condemned as a convicied Heretick, and
being delivered over to the secular Power to be burnt for Contumacy and
Impenitency. Nor must he, unless he will commit a mortal Sin, redeem his
Life by a salse Confeffion of a Crime he hath not committed. So that in this
Case the miserable Wretch, falssy accused, which they themselves allow doth
sometimes happen‚ is condemned as an Heretick by the Laws of the Inqui-
fiti0n‚ delivered over to the secular Court to be burnt, and yet is at the same
time a true Catholick‚ and, as they themselves say, ffiall obtain for this
Wrong the Crown of Martyrdom. So that an innocent and just Person is
condemned by the Laws of the Inquisition, and he whom the Inquifitors sen-
tence to Death‚ is aPerson acceptable to God, and to be honoured with a
Crown of Martyrdom. 'Tis a Scandal that any Tribunal ssiould be erested,
against which so foul an Objeffion lies ; or that the Church‚ after Satisfaction
is made to God, and the interna] Court of the Church by Repentance, should
ere& another external Court, where Satisfaction must be made by the Punish—
ment of the Penitent.

¹ VII. A seventhInstance is, thatthey ‘would have Persons informed against
become their own AccuserS. For as soon as ever any one is thrown into JayL,
he is bound by an Oath to declare the Truth. Then he is asked the Reason of
his Imprisonrnent‚ that he may accusehimself, if he hath happened to do any
thing that will render him guilty in the Court of the Inquifition. Whereas
the Method of all Courts requires that the Accusation be shewn to the Cri·
minal, and he himself be examined concerning the Fa& he is accused os. But
in the Inquifition every Prisoner is lest toguess at the Crime he is accused os.
There are ostentimes Things spoken innocently and inadvertently‚ some-
times Words are turned into a quite different Sense‚ sometimes the Crime it
self is evidently forged·‚ and, in the mean while, if he can’t accuse himself,
he miserably pines away sometimes for Years together in an execrable Jayl,
that his Constancy may be broken by the Tediousness of his Imprisonment„
If he ca-n’t guess at the Crime, and waits till 'tis objetfted against him by the
Promotor Fiscal‚ he is looked on as guilty of Contumacy, stubborn‚ and
perjured, and if then by Chance he remembers the Crime, and owns it, he

but if it be sully proved, he {Is cohdemned‚ accoiding to the Laws ofpthe In-
quisition, as a negative Conviffit. So that however he behave‚ he can’t pos-
-fibly escape the cruel Hands of the Inquisitors.

VIII. An eighth Instance is, that the Inquifitors use various Arts to draw

ou} a Cplnfeffion from the PrisonegS,s by making them deceitsul Pronssiseg,
