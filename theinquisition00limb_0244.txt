Water, and all other Hereticks of both Sexes, and of whatfhever Name ; and ordain
that their Goods shall he confiscated in stzch Manner, that their Children may never inhe-
rit them, fince 'tis much more heinous to offend the eternal‚ than the temporal Majesty.
But if any come under a bare Suspicion, unleſs hy a proper Purgation they shall de·-
monstrate their Innocence, at the Command (ff the Church, according to the Degree
of their Suspicion, and the Qality of their Person, let them be accounted infamous by
all, and as under our. Ban .· And if they remain such hy the Space of one year, we
condemn them as Hereticks. We ordain alst), by this our perpetual Edibl, that our
Officers and Confiils, or Rec‘icrs, , whatever be their Offices, shall take a publick Oath v

Councils had decrecd, that every Man should distribute a certain Part of his Goods, the Tyth for
