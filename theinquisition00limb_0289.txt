ΞΥ Αυζὴοτίῑγ of this Bull they appointed only two Inquifitors at Se-ville,
Friar Michael a Morillo, and Friar John ιι S. Mamm, the first Βοέὶοῖ, the
other Batchelor of Divinity, both PredicantS. An. 148 2. the Pope confirmed
these tWO, who were chosen Inquifitors by their Majesties, upon this Condition,
that they should proceed in Causes of Faith in C01ijun6tion with the Ordina-
ries of Places, according to the Order of the Law. But because the Pope
apprehended that the Inquifitors, which were settled either by the General or
the Provincials os the Dominican Order in the Provinces‚ were sufficient to ma-
nage the Affairs of the Faith, he deprived their Majesties of the Power of
making Inquifitors in other Places. An. 1482. the same Sixtus IV. at the Re-
quest of their said Majesties, appointed by his Bull, bearing Date the gd of
the Ides of February, seven Dominicans Censors of the F aith, who might have
Cognizance of Matters relating to the Faith in the Kingdoms of Castile and

the Testimony of credible Witneffes, and, thro' the Violence of their Tor· p “
ments, confeffing their Crimes, were thrown into the Fire3 of which some
are reported to have bewailed their Sins, and acknowledged Christ, whilst others
perfisted in their Errors, calling on the Name of Moses. Within a few Years
two thousand of them of both Sexes were burnt. Others, profeffing Repen-
tance, were condemned to perpetual Imprisonment‚ others wore Croffes 3 the
Bones of others who were dead were taken out of their Graves and burnt to
Ashes, their Effe&s confiscated‚ and their Children deprived of their Honours
and Offices. Most of the Jews belng terrified with this Cruelty, left their
Country and Houses, and in this great Distress of their Affiirs, fled from the
Kingdoms of their Catholick Majesties. Many went into Portugal‚ many into
Navarre, others into Italy, others into France and other Countries‚ where they
thought they could be safe 3 all whose Goods and Effects, moveable and im-
moveable, if they had any, their Catholick Majesties distributed towards the
War, which was then made against the Moors and other Barbarians. These
Things amounted to a prodigious Sum. In Andalusta *and Grmmda alone,
