Commendations of their Saints. Canus himself confeffes, that most uf their
Writers have been destitute of every Qualification of a good Historian,
Bellarmine‚ in his Marks of the Church, says: The Catholieks are no where cap. ω’,
found to have praised or approved either the Domine or Life of any* Heathem ον
Heretieks. So that it was a sufficient Reason to write the worst Things of
any Man, or to conceal and condemn to eternal Oblivion the best and
most laudable Animis, if he had been pronounced an Heretick by the Churclr,
and the Papists now think it Reason enough to give no Credit to any Per-
son, if he doth not condemn, or if he praises the Αᾶἰοηε of those who have
been declared Hereticks by the Church of Rome, and hath in any manner

in his Wriffings, he villifie? (md cruelly uses some of the Popes, who were tZe bes}
of Men, cmd commentis and extols some of the German Εἱῳενονς, who were Re-
bels and Enemz'esto the Church of Rome. So that you may know the Lion hy his
Paw, i. e. [ι Lutheran hy thoft he prazss’s er condemns. If this Inference of
Canus were true, 'tis necessary, that he who wouid be owned for a Catho-
lick, must load all the Enemies of the Church of Rome with Infamy and
Disgrace‚ and never blame the Catholicks‚ but praise and commend every
thing they do, But if we read the Writings and Histories of the modern
Papists‚ we 1hall find them filled with so many Stories and evident Lyes,
to which the publick Acts and Documents bear VVitness, that one can.
scarce find t'ne smallest Footsteps of Truth in them, and may justly af-
firm, that they wrote entirely for Gain, or the Establilhment of Error.-
And if their Power ssmuld rise again to the same Height as it was in:
former Ages, so that they should be able wholly to destroy the Writings
and Monuments of those who differ from them, and Persons were to leam
from their Writings only the Doctrines and Aestions of the Reform’d
and Protestant‚ who doth not see what wretched Accounts they would
transmit to Posterity‚ even lighter than Vanity it se]f; which however
could scarce be convicted of Falshood by proper Testimonie35 after they
had thus destroyed the contrary Documents? And therefore, as 'tis not safe‘
to form a Judgment 'of the Principles and Behaviour of the Reform'd and
Protestant from PopishWritings only, so we ought to bevery cautious and back«
ward of pronouncing concerning the DOCtrines and Aetions of those who were
condemned for Hereticks‚ from the Writings and Histoi-ies of the Ancients,¹
because their Writings have been so entirely suppress’d by the Industry
and Care of their Adversaries, that there is scarce one genuine Book of
theirs remaining, wherein they have described or defended their Doetrine
or Manner of Proceeding. But 'tis Time to return from this Di⁸
reffion.
g We have shewn with what Bitterness the Orthodox have persecuted the.
Arians and Donatists3 nor did the Arians exercise less Cruelty against the
Orthodox, when they had an Emperor who favour'd their Party. But it

must be confess'd this Cruelty was not always equal: For althougssritahle
