C H A P. VIII.
Of the Receivers and Defenders qu E R Ε Τ Ι c K s.

Γ H E Council of Tarracon hath determined those to be Receivers of He-
reticks, who have twice, or more, knowingly received Hereticks in their

. House, or any other Place‚ A Receptacle is an House or Lodging, where

Hereticks have met together twice or moreto preach or read, or where they
have frequently lodged. But such offend more grievoussy who know their
Errors, and that the Church doth persecute them, and nevertheless receive
and conceal them from the Hands of the Church, even though they have done
this but once ·‚ and by this Reception they render themselves suspect of Here-
sy, more or less, according to the Difference of Circumstances. And there-
fore, as suspected Persons‚ they are obliged to abjure. Their Puniffiment is
Excommunication, and if after this they perfist in their Crime, they are put
under the Bann, banished for ever, and suffer Confiscation of all their Goods.
But if any one receives an heretical Relation, his Crime is less, and he is
more gently punissied. And in this they consider the Degrees of Kindred‚ that
such who are nearest akin to the received Heretick, may be more gently
dealt with than those who are farther off.

The Defenders of Hereticks‚ according to the Definition of the Council
of Tarracon, are such who knowingly defend Hereticks by Word or Deed, or
any Method in their own Lands, or any where else, whereby the Church is
prevented from executing its Office in the Extirpation of heretica] Pravity.
Now there are different Ways of defending. An Heretick may be defended
with Arms, or without them, or by giving him Notice for his Escape. He

the Office of the Inquifition. Befides this, there is anot-her Case by which a
Man may be said to be a Defendet of Hereticks‚ when he puts another Person
or himself in the Room of the Heretick to be apprehende& Concerning
which, Innocent IV. sent this Rescript. Ad extirpanda. Ifczt any Time, any
Men or Women not Hereticks, shall, with their Consent, be taken and put in the
Place of Hereticks, or themselves personate Hereticks, let them suffer perpetual Impri-
sonment, and at the same time let the Hereticks themselves be compelled to return and
deliver up themselves. And as for those who contrived the Deceit‚ let them, ac·
cording to the aforesaid Law, suffer Confiscation of their Goods‚ and perpetual
Bamfhment. In the same Bull there are other Sorts of Punisnments ap-

poimed ·
