Anastasius, who succeeded Zeno, was himself a great Lover of Peace, and Evag. ις.
endeavoured to promote it, both amongst the Clergy and Laity, and *herefore c. 30·
ordered, that there should be no Innovations in the Church whatsoever. But
this Moderation was by no means pleasmg to the Monks and Bishops. Some of
them were great Sticklers for the Council of Chalc-edm, and would not allow so
much as a Syllable or a Letter of their Decrees to be altered, nor communi-
cate with those who did not receive them. Others were so far from susmitting
to this Synod, and their Determinations, that they anathematized it ·, whilst
others adhered to Zeno's Her-oticon, and maintained Peace with one another,
even though they were of different Judgment concerning the Nature of Christ.
Hence the Church was divided into Pachom, so that the Bifhops would not
communicate with each other. Not only the Eastern Bishops separated from
the Western3 but those of the same Provinces had Schisms amongst them—
selves. The Emperor, to prevent as much as poffible these Qarrels, banished
those who were most remarkably troublesome from their Sees, and particularly
the Bissaops of Constantinople and Antioch‚ forbidding all Persons to preach either
for or against the Council of Chalcedon, in any Places where it had not been
usual to do it before 3 that by allowing all Churches their several Customs‚ he
might prevent any Disturbances upon account of Innovations. But the Monks C· 31, 32·
and Bishops prevented all these Attempts for Peace, by forcing one another to
make new Confeffions and Subscriptions, and by anathematizing all who differed
from them as Heretick53 so that by their seditious and obstinate Behaviour they
occafioned innumerable Qarrels and Murthers in the Empire. They also treat-
ed the Emperor himself with great Insolence, and excommunicated him as an
Enemy to the Synod of Chalcedon. Mandonius, Bishop of Constantinople‚ and c·4<‡·
his Clergy, raised the Mob of that City against him, only for adding to one of
their Hymns these Words, Who was crucifiedfor us. And when for this Reason
Macedonius was expelled his Bishoprick, they urged on the People to such an
height of Fury as endangered the utter Destruftion of the City ·‚ for in their
Rage they set Fire to several Places in it, cut off the Head ofa Monk, cry ing
out, he was an Enemy of the §Trinity ; and were not to be appeased till the Em-
peror himselfwent amongst them without his imperial Diadem‚ and brought
them to Temper by proper Submiffions and Persuasions. And though hec· 34·
had great Reason to be offended with the Bishops for such Usage‚ yet he was
of so human and tender a Disposition, that though he ordered several of them
to bedeposed for various Offences, yet apprehending that it could not be ef·
fested withoutBloodshed, he wrote to the Prefect of Asta, Not to do any Yhing
in the Affair, isit would occafion the shedding afingle Drop of Blood.

Under this Emperor Symmachus ssissmp of Rome expelled the Manichees from Platiae
