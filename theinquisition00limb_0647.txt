The Bishop and Inquifitor therefore meet together, and by an interlocutory
Sentence, pronounce that the accused Person is to be put to the Torture
such a Day and such an Hour. Thus the Madrid Instructiom An. 1561.

c. 48. commands. Let the Inquisitors and Ordinary meet together to promum-e Sen-

tence of sonare, and in the ſsime Manner be present at the Execzction of it, by rea-

son of the various Cafhs that may huppen under the Torture. For neither the Bi-

shop without the Inquisitor, nor the Inquifitor without the Bishop, or his
Vicat, can put any one to the Torture. But if the Bishop or his Vicar, up-

on Summotis sent them, either refuses or negle&s to be presentwithin eight
Days‚ the Inquifitor may proceed alone to the Torture; or if one be noc
within Reach of the other, if he be absent a great way off, then the other

may proceed by himself. But what Place may be said to be a great way off,

is left at the Pleasure of the Judge to determine. However, the Biffiop and
Inquifitor may depute each other, or fignify their Consent by Letters‚
which must be done within eight Days after they are summoned. In the Inqui-Carena,
fition at Cremona, the Advocate of the Exchequer is present at the Torture,p- Μ- 92
and the lnquifitor there sits in the Middle between the Vicat· Genera} on hisnum 4¹·
right Hand, and the Advocate on his left.

As to the Persons who may be tortured, altho' in all other Causes andpegna,
Crimes some Persons are excepted, such as Βοέὶοῑε, Soldiers, Officers, No-lbid-
blemen, and their Sons, yet in this most grievous and horrible Crime of He-P· ⁶4²⁸
resy, there is no Privilege to defend any one, but all may be put to the⁶43'
Torture, even Clergymen‚ Monks‚ and other Religious. But to prevent
Excommunication‚ by grievoussy torturing or hurting thern, and on Account
of the Dignity with which they are inve-sted, they torture them more gently
and mildiy, unless the Heinousness of the Crime, and the Strength of the E-
vidence requires otherwise. As to such who are freed from being tortured
for other Crimes upon Account of their Youth, or old Age, or being with
Child, they are not to be tortured for Heresy‚ Persons under twenty-five
may be tortured for Suspicion of Heresy‚ but not if they are under fourteen, but
they may be terrified and beat. Neither is there any Exception of PIace,
altho' by antient Custom or municipal Laws the Torture is not otherwise to
be inflicted there. Thus in the Kingdom of Aragon no Judge can order any
Crimina] to the Torture, but yet in Favour of the Faith any Person3‚ even
tho’ privileged‚ may be tortured for Suspicions of Heresy.

After the Sentence of Torture is pronounced, the Officers prepare thern-
selves to inflict it. ‘⁶ The Place of Torture in the Spanifh Inquisition is gene· Consaiv.
