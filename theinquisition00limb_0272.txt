they not deprived of the Use of what they had. For Martin IV. 'published a
Bull, Feb. Cal. 10. 1282. by which he ordained that the Property, the Righ't'
and Dominion of every Thing which the Friars had by Donation or Lega-
cy, should be in the Church of Rome ·‚ but that the Friars should have the Use.
He also allowed the Ministers and Keepers of the Order, the Faculty of nass

Clement V. confirmed the same in the Cotincil of Vienna, by a Constituti0n‚
beginning, Exivi de poawzdizo, extant among the Clementines. However, Cle-
ment allow’d, that when it appeared very likely, even from Experience, that
they could not otherwise secure the Neceffaries of Life, they might have
Granaries or Storehouses, in which they might repofit and keep whatever they
could get by begging. He left, indeed, the Ministers and Keepers tojudge
of such Nec-effity, and gave it in special Charge to their Consciences.

Against this, those who were called Begzcz'ns protested, declaring they
were of the third Rule of St. Francis. They contended that the Franciscans
ought in no Case >to have Granaries or Storehouses, because this was con-1r
trary to the perfectior] of the Francifcan Poverty; that the Pope· had not
Authority to dispense with the Rule of Francis, and that if he> did, hisvDecrees
were of no Force, and might jnstly be disregarded. One of them who
lived at this Time, Peter John OZivus, who wrote a Postill on the Apoca-
lypse, applied to the Pope and Church of Rome the Things spoken of the
Beast, and the Whore of Babylon, of which frequent Mention is made in the
Collection of the Sentences of the Tholoufh Inquisition.

John XXII. sticceeded Clement, who, by. several Constitutions‚ condemn’d
the Tenet of the Begetins, and allowed the anxsmns, that by the Judgment of
the Heads of the Order they might lay up and preserve Corn, Bread and
Wine in Granaries and Storehouses. The Beguins believed that such a Con-
ceffion derogated from the Sublimity and Perfeetion of their Rule and Po-
verty‚ and therefore warmly opposed it3 and in order to defend their own
Rule, dared to deny the Authority of the Pope: Upon this Account they
were declared Hereticks, and Commandment was given to the Inquifitors of
heretical Pravity, to bring them before their Tribunal, and to proceed
against them as Hereticks. This was a bloody Decree, beginning, Gloriosam
Ecclefiam, in which the Pope gave the Inquifitors these special Commands:
Call before yon, hy the Ecclefiastical Censure, all and stngular received by them
to their Seii, especially such as cire profeffed3 examine them concerning the Fama,
and enqnire carefnlly and diligently, by your sel-ves or others, without Noifi’ and the
Form os Judgment, concerning the Errors of the qfomjsoiej, and search after their
Complices alid Abettors ·, and if there be need, order them to be taken up and con-
fined, making Use, when there is Occoston, of the Affistance of the secular Arm.
