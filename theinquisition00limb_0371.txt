“ at the Command of the Diocesan‚ or his Vicars, or the Inqaisttors of heretical Pra-
“ vity‚ swearpreciſsely to regard, inviolahly to ohserve, and cause to be ohserved bv
“ their sabjens, *during the whole ΕΤ ime of their Government‚ in all the Countrie‘s
“ subject to their Jurisdifftion and 'Governnzent‚ the Constitutions puhlifhed, and ap=¹
“ proved hy the Apostolick See against Heretickss their Believers, Receivers, Fa=
“ vourers and Defenders‚ their Children and Grandchildren : And whosoever rffnfts
“ to swear to obser-ve them is infamous, and shall be deprived of the Honour and Office
“ of his Government‚ as a Favourer of Heretick5‚ and suspected concerning the Faith ;
“ and let him not be accounted as a chief Magistrate, Head Officer, Consid, or Go—
“ vernor, or ever he raised to any puhlick Dignity or'Office. And let whatever he
“ doth as chief Magistrate, Consul, or Govemor, have no Validity. But Clement,
in his Constitutions‚ saith thus: “ If any chief Magistrate, Head Offiwr, or any
“ of the before-named, shall refuse and neglebl‘ to ohserve these Constitittions, and eve-
“ ry Thing contained in the7n3 hesta'es the¹ Mari< of Perjary, and the Hazard
“ of perpetual Infamy‚ let him forfeit two hundred Marks, which shall be exaHed of
“ him without Remiffion, and converted to the publick Use of the Place where he go=
“ verns ·‚ and yet nevertheleſs he shall he deprived of the Honour and Office of his Go-
“ vernment, as a perjured and infamous Perfiin, and as a Favourer of Hereticks,
“ and suspected concerning the Faith, and never more be any where accounted as a
“ chief Magistrate, Head Officer, Consul, or Governor‚ nor ever afterpromoted to
“ any publice Dignity or Office whatsoever. Boniface, in 6 Decret. says thus : But
‘⁶ if any one of the aforesaid chief Magistrates, temporal Lords, Governors, or their
“ Officiali, or others, shall ae? contrary to the aforesaid, or shall presume to oppose him-
“ fhlf in the aforcfizid Affair of the Faith to the aforesaid Diocelan, Bishop‚ or lnqui-
“ stt0r5,'or any ways to hinder him : As alsi) every one who fhall knowingly give them As-

“ fista'nce‚ Counsel, or Favour in the aforesaid, let him know that he shall bepierced
“ thro’ with the Sword ofExcommunication, which, if he endures for a Y ear with an

5‘ obstinate Mind, he shall from thence be condemned for an Heretick.

All these Constitutions wholly subje& the secular Magistrat‘e to the Inquifi-
tors, who bid them draw their Sword at their Pleasure‚ and readily exe«
cute their Comrnands with a blind Obedience.
