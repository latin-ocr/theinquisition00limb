“ be believed, that in a Course of fourteen or sixteen Years, those Particu-
ιε 1353 might have been forgotten by you, and that on this Account you con—
“ cealed the Injunstion you had been served with, when you demanded Li·

“ Advantage by the Licence you artfully and fraudulently procured, because
“ you did not signify the Injunffion you had received.

“ And whereas it appears to us, that you have not declared to us the
