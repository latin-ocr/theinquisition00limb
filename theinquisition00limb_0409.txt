and cruel than Scythiam, into whose Hands thou couldst carry me, so that I might
but escape the Pawsqf theſs? Wretches. Olmedus also, another Person famous for
Piety and Learning, fell into the Inquifitors Hands at Seville, and thro’ the
Inhumanity of his Treatment, which had also proved fatal to Constantine,
commeted a grievous Illness‚ and at last died in the Midst of the Nastiness
and Stench. He was used to say, ‘Throw me any where, O my God, fi’ that I

' The Author of the History of Goa agrees in this Account, who frankly cap 19
owns, that through the Cruelty and Length of his Imprisonment, he fell into 20‚⁰2,1,'
Despair, and thereby often attempted to destroy himself3 first by starving
himself, and because that did not succeed, he feigned himselfsick3 and when
rhe Phyfician of the Inquifition found his Pulse unequal, and that he was1fe-
vourilh, he ordered him to be let Blood‚ which was done again five Days
after. When the Dofflor was gone, he unbound his Arm every Day, that
so by the large Effufion of Blood‚ he might continually grow weaker and
weaker. In the mean while he eat very little, that by Hunger and Loss of
Blood‚ he might put an End to his miserable Life. Whilst he was in this sad
Condition, he had sent him a Confeffor of the Franciscan Order, who, by
various Arguments oi Comfort, endeavoured to recover him from his Despair.
They also gave him a CompanIOn in his Jayl, which was some Comfort to
himin his Confinement. But growing well again after about five Months,
they took his Companion from him. The Lonesomeness of his Jayl brought
on again his Melancholy and Despair, which made him invent another Me-
thod to destroy himself. He had a Piece of Gold Money,which he had con-
cealed in his Cloaths, which he broke into two Parts 3 and making it sharp,
he opened with it a Vein in each Arm, and lost so much Blood‚ that he
fell into a Swoon, the Blood running about the Jayl. But some of the Ser-
vants happening to come before the usual Time to bring him something, found
him in this Condition. The Inquifitor hereupon ordered him to be loaded
with Irons upon his Arms and Hands, and striffly watched. This Cruelty pro-
voked him to that Degree, that he endeavoured to beat his Brains out against
the Pavement and the Walls ·‚ and undoubtedly the Ligaments upon his Arms
would have been torn off, had he continued any longer in that State. Upon this
they took off his Chains, gave him good Words, encouraged him, and sent h-im :t
Companion, by whose Conversation he was refreshed, and bore his Misery with
a little more Easiness ofMind. But after two Months they took him from him

again, so that the Solitude ofhis Jayl vyais more distreffing to him than ὺεῖῗτξέ
