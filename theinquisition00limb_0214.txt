⁶⁶ thou-Stephana de Preaudo, formerly Wife of Peter Gilhert, being inseete‘d
⁶⁶ with the pestiferous Doc‘hines of Hereticks‚ dost affert and confess into*
‘⁶ lerable and abominable Errors, contrary to the Catholick Faith of the ho-
‘⁶ ly Roman Church, denying, with profane Lips‚ that the Incarnation of Otr-r
⁶⁶ Lord Jefifs Clu-§fl hath been or is from the Woman, and that there is to be
⁶⁶ a Resurrection of human Bodies‚ attributing the Creation of v-ifible Things ,
⁶⁶ to the Devi]‚ whom thou assertest to be the Prince of this World, thereby
‘⁶ denying the Creation to be from the Almig'nty Gode And thou dost rer
⁶⁶ proncht'nlly disown, deny and condemn, acccording to the Error of hereti·
⁶⁶ cal Impiety‚ all the seven Sacraments of our Scilvation, viz. Baptism by ·
⁶⁶ corp ral water, and administer’d to Chiidren² Likewise the Sacrament of
‘⁶ t'ne holy Body and Blood of our Lord Jefizs Chrzst from Bread and Wine up·
‘⁶ on the Ait-ar. And the Confeffisn of Sins made to the Priests of the Roman
⁶⁶ Church‚ to whom thou denyest the Power of binding and loosing. Likewise
⁶⁶ the Sacrament of carnal Matrimony, which thou afl'ertest and affirmest can-
⁶⁶ not be without Szn, according to the-'Doffi-ine of those Hereticks. Thou
⁶⁶ also reproachest and blasphemest our holy Orders, by preferring the damn-
“ ed and profane Order of Hereticks. Thou sayest that the Order of St.
⁶⁶ James‚ or extreme Unffion of the Sick with material Oil, profits no-
⁶⁶ thing, preferring to it the execrable Impofition of Hands‚ which they
⁶⁶ call Spiritual Baptism‚ or the Consolation‚ or Reception‚ and good End.
⁶⁶ Thou also approvest and commendest, dost defend and sustain, the Life,
⁶⁶ Se& and Faith of the said Hereticks, and impioussy affertest and declarest,
⁶⁶ that there is no Salvation to any unless he be received by them, and die in
· ⁶⁶ their δρᾶ, Likewise thou affertest and affirmest, that the Sign of the holy
‘⁶ Cross‚ which the whole Church adores as the Sign of our Salvation, and a ff
⁶⁶ Representation of our Saviour’s Passion‚ is the detestable Sign of the
⁶⁶ Devil. Likewise thou reproachest and condemnest the State of the
⁶⁶ whole Roman Church, and deniest the Power of binding and loofing in
⁶⁶ all the Prelates of the Roman Church, saying, that they cannot bind
‘⁶ and loose other Sinners, since they are greater Sinners themselves3
‘⁶ and thou affertest that those Hereticks, whom thou callest and affirm—
“ est to be good Men, can give the Holy Spirit for Salvati0n to those
⁴⁶⁶ whom they receive, and sayest that they are Imitators of the Apostle, lead
‘⁶ their Life, and are of their Sest, and sayest and attestest many other erro·
‘⁶ neous and false Things, according to the Premiffes, as we our selves have
‘⁶ heard them with our Ears several Times from thy own Mouth‚ in the Pre-
‘⁶ sence of many Persons. Likewise we have heard from thee, many others
‘⁶ being present and hearing also, that thou hast seen and heard, in their turn,
⁰⁶⁶ seven perse& Hereticks in Tholouse, viz. Peter Raimondz· de Sanno Papulo,
‘⁶ and Meffier Bernart de Monte Acuto, and Peter Auteriz'‚ and James his Son,
⁶⁶ and William Αῑιίενὶἱ, Brother of the said Peter, and Aucelius and Andrew,
⁶⁶ and hast seen an eighth Heretick in the Way‚ whom thou namest Philip.
⁶⁶ Likewise thou hast confeffed before the said Inquifitor, that thou hast ado-5
<⁶⁶ red the said Heretick James after an heretical Manner. Upon all which Er-

⁶⁶ rors
