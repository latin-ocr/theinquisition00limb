¹66 The Hmromc os the INQtJstTonss

Tit. de J accuse N. who being baptized a Christian, believes and teaches many Herefies‚
Accusati. and especially this amithal, after mentioning which, the Promotor Fiscalcon.
·0³'¹m¹⁵· eludes, with demanding that N. may be punished as an obstinate Heretick,
and suffer the most grievous Punithments of Heresy.
Lewisa Pas-amo gives us a larger Form of this Bill of IndiRment, in his
History of the Inquifition, Lib. 3. Q. 9. n. 21.

V cry Illustrious and most Reverend Lords·‚ ·
Doc't'or or Licentiate N. and Advocate Fiscal of this holy Inquisttion, that I may
act better, according to Law, as I ought to do, appear before your most reve·

rend Lordships, and having performed all the Solemnities required, and neceffary by
Law, do criminally accuse N. of the ‘Town or City of N. the Dioceseof N. and
Kingdom of N. and byspecifying the Fan say, that when the aforesaid N. was a
Christian, and washed with the Waters of Baptism, and marked with the Charac‘i'er
of Christ, and by common Estimation reputed as such, and called so in the Opinion of
all, or being found such, and in Poffieffion, or as tho’ he had been a Christian,
enjoying alsh the Exemptions and Immunities of Christians, and using their Privile-
*ges as he ought to do, yet negletling the Fear of Christ, our Saviour, and despifing
the Rigourof Justice of this Office of the holy Inquisttion, hath said and done, some
Thing heretical, and many other Things as an Heretick, by which 'tis presumed, and
ought to be prefumed, that the asoressiid N. bath lost that Faith, and that Belief
or Virtue of Believing, which was given him in the most holy Sacraments of Baptism
and Confirmation ·, and that he hath given undoubted Faith to those Errors, which
those false and impious Perfhns Martin Luther‚ Calvio, Mahomet, and other
Arch Hereticks have advanced, and I do especially accuse him, because he was per·
suaded, that any Person in those Errors might obtain eternal Glory.

And, in the first Place‚ about two Years ag0, as, I suppose, the aforesaid N.
when he was in a certain Place of the City or T own of N. did, in the Presence of the
venerable and discreet Persam, N. say and pronounce certain heretical Words, or
szcſjcec‘ted of Heresy, or did such a Thing as savoured of Heresy, plainly manifesting
that he thought so, viz. that Faith alone, without Works‚ was ficfficient to Salva-
tion, and to obtain eternal Glory 3 or that Mahomet was the Meffenger of the true
God, and that the Laws given by him are sufficient for any one to be saved by, and he
may he saved by them. On this account one of the By-standers, perfettly bearing what
he fizid, sharply reproved him3 but he, on the contrary, produced, and suddenly
alledgedseveral Places of the holy Scripture, to defend his impious and heretical Opi·-
nion, and changing and despifing the true Sense and right Undeistanding, interpreted
the alledged Places according to his own WH, and contrary to the vulgate Edition of
the Church of Rome, and the canonically received Opinion, tenacioussy adhered to
his Error. And not content with these Things, he produced many other Arguments‚
by which he might maintain and confirm his Heresy‚ which he doth firmly hold, believe
and defend, from whence 'tis clearly inferred‚ that he is, without doubt, an Heretick.

Bestdcs, the aforesaid N. endeavouring every Day to spread his Error, not con-
tent with his own Fall, halb, with the greatest Diligence and earnes} Care, in this
or that Place, the third Day of the fourth Month N. taught others according to his own

Mind
