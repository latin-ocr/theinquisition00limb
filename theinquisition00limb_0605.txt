by Oath‚ in which they declared that the Praetor, who with his Wife, were
both re·baptized‚ had a Meeting ofthe Anabaptists in his House, and that his
Wife was present at the Meeting. This Evidence the Parson sent in Writino
to Ruardus Tapperus, Inquifitor of Lovain. But altho’ this Matter was caro.
ried on very privately‚ the Praetor was too quick not to smell it out 3 and
therefore to prevent his being destroyed suddenly, and without being able [Ο
make his Defenoe, he goes immediately to Bruffels, and applies himself to Assa-
ry Qeen Dowager of Hungary‚ then Governess‚ and in whom he had a very
considerable Interest, and managed his Cause with so much Dexterity an'd
Success, that the Senator Cornelius Mmk, and with him the Secretary of the
supream Council of Mechlin‚ were sent to Amsterdam to enquire into the Af-
fair. And they found it no difficult Matter, upon examining the Witnefi‘es,
to dete& the Falshood and Perjury. Butas it was neceffary to proceed ssowly
to make a full Discovery, the Cause was committed to the Court of Holland‚
who deputed some of their Mernbers to make Inquifition concerning it. The
two Women were imprisoned at the Hctgue, and being interrogated about the
Praetor's Anabaptism‚ and the Circumstances of it, they said that he was re-
baptized in a Chapel that lay neat his Garden, and that they saw it thro' the
Window standing upon a Bench. Upon this two ofthe Senators were sent to
inspe& the Place, and found the Window so very high, that tho' they stood
upon the Bench, they could not reach it with their Hand, fo that 'twas im·-
poffiblethe women could look thro’ it, to see what was transadied within,
‚And thus the Falshood was discovered. The Authority of the City‚ and the
Favour of the Ecclefiasticks‚ for some time protected the Consul and the Par-
son. But the Crime was too enormous to escape unpunished‚ and therefore
both ofthem were apprehended by Order of the Court of Hollcmd, May 3,
1557. the parson, as he was standing before the Ahar, and in so hasty a man-
ner, that they would not suffer him to go home, and change his Garments,
After this they were both carried to the Hague. The Notary and the other
Evidence had the same Fate. And though it was difficult to cover over a
Falshood, proved by so many Persons, who agreed in their Confeffions, yet
it was a long while, yea, several Years before the whole was openly discovered.
But at last the false Witneffes seeing no Poffibility of escaping, asked Pardon
for their Offence of the Royal Clemency, and publickly confeffed their False-
hood and Perjury. One of the Witnesses was publickly whipped, The NO-
tary deprived ofhis Office, and banilhed. The Parson openly confeffed thar,
the Accusations he had written against the Praetor and his Wife, to Ram-dus
TaPPeru-fs WCFC rashs impertinens, and without due Iiiformatitm, and said he
repented ofit‚ and was therefore commanded to depart from Amsterdam‚ and
deprived of the Office of Commissary of the Inquisition. One of the Women
died in Jayl‚ and as to Συρίη, {he had, May 3, 1561. her ‘song-ue first cut
