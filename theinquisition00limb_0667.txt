did so, and believed that they ought to do so, then they abjure as formally
Hereticks or Apostates‚ and are more grievously punished‚ especially if they
have committed heretica} or apostate Aetions voluntarily‚ or without being
compelled by Fear, or by a ssight Occafion of Fear. Is they do not appear
voluntarily‚ and yet confess heretical and apostate Aetions, but deny the
evil Intention, then they are to be tortured upon such Intenti0n‚ that ic
may be known whether they have really believed so or not·, and if after the
legal Torture they persist in the negative, saying, they had no ill Intention,
then they likewise abjure as vehemently suspected. As to those who have
committed such Things thro’ grievous Fear, 'tis determined that ’tis likely
they had no evil Intention. But if they confess the evil Intention or Error of
the Minci, then they are compelled to abjure as formal Hereticks or Apo-
states‚ upon their being willing to return to the Unity of the Church, and
are farther condemned as converted Hereticks to other Punishments and
Penances, which we shall hereafter describe. But in order to their being
more grievoussy or mildly punished‚ the Nature of that Fear they were un-
der is considered, and the Circumstances of the Person offending3 as whether
he was a Youth, or a Man, learned or unskilful, one of the Laity or Clergy,
or Religious, and thelike Things which usually leffen or encrease the Offen-
ces. There are also others who pronounce heretical Words which have
no Excute, viz. in Jest, or Anger, or mere Simplicity, on which Offenders
the Inquisitors may lay pecuniary Mul&s.

such Faets are sometimes committed thro’ carnal Affeffion, sometimes thro’

The Form of Abjuration formerly used in the Inquifition of Tholoufi’‚ of-
tentimes occurs in the Book of Sentences. Herein they abjure every Heresyftl·100··

Roman Church, and alt Belief of Hereticks of every condemned See} whatsoever, by
whatsbever Names they are called, and all-favouring receiving and defending of them,
and Communication with them, under the Pumfhment due by Law to thoſse who relapsi*
into the Heresy they have judicially abjured. They moreover promise and swear‚
that they will pursue‚ and reveczl and discover Hereticks‚ and their Believers and Fa-
vourers, and Receivers and Defenders, and who fly for Heresy, whensoever and
whercfiyever they know them to he, or any one of them3 and that they will obey
and be obedient, that they will hold and keep, and defend the Catholick Faith of our
Lord Jefits Christ, which the holy Church of Rome preaches and observem and
that they will obey and be obedient to the Commands of the Chumh, and the ln-
quzfitors and their Succeffirs‚ and that they wzll receive, and, according to their
Power, fulfil and penset? the Penance injoined them, and that they will nevcrfly uorsa, 149,
