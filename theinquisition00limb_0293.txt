[Ludovicus a Paramo relates, that in the Year 1485. there were famous A &sl-b* 2· ts't,

of the Inquifition, by the Inquisitors of heretical Pravity, in the Town of Gua- ³· ,NP- '4-

dalup, held in a Pulpit and on a very large Scaffold, erected before the Doors of ‘⁹ ’ξ ΡΙ·

the church, in theChurch Yard, over against the Market piace, in which Acts1> ³ '⁹'

of the Inquifition, which were seven or eight, F riar Didachus Marciam, an

heretical Monk, and fifty two for judaifing, of both Sexes, were deliver'd over

to the Fire ·, forty fix Bodies of Hereticks were dog out ostheir Graves, and

adjudged to the Flames3 the Images of twenty five absent Persons were

others sent to the Gallies 3 and others condemned to ware consecrated course

Habits, as a Mark of perpetual Penance and Infamy. When these Αὲὶε were

finish’d, and the Fathers Inquifitors were departing from Guadalup, they

publish’d an Edi& by the Common Cryer, that within one Month all Per-

sons, of every Sex- and Age, infected with the Jewish Superstition, should

leave that Town, under the Penalty of being puniffied as relapsed ε And they

made it a perpetual Law, that for the Honour of the Virgin Mother of God,

and her sacredConvent and People, no converted Person, or of the Race of

the Jews, should from henceforth ever dwell there. Upon Occafion of this

Edict, Care was taken in the first general Chapter, that was afterwards cele-

brated in the Convent of St. Jerome, the Prior of which, F riar Numinis ab

Arevolo, with other Inquifitors, held those Acts, that no one of the said Race

should ever be admitted to the sacred Order of St. Jerome. What Paruimus

adds farther is ridiculous: That when the aforesaid Inquisitor of the holy

Office eagerly defired some Sign from the bleffed Virgin issar), of Guadaeiupg
