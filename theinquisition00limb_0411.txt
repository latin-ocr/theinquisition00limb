which the Prisoner is commanded to lay his Hand, and to swear that he will
speak the Truth‚ and keep every Thing secret. After they have sufficiently
interrogated him, the Inquifitors ring a Bell for the Warder, who is com>
manded to carry back his Prisoner to Jayl.

No one in the Prison must so much as mutter, or make any Noise‚ but
must keep profound Silence, Ifany one bemoans himself, or bewails his Mis-2
fortune, or prays to God with an audible Voice, or sings a Psalm or sacred
Hymn, the Jayl-Keepers‚ who continually watch in the Porches, and can
hear even the least Sound, immediately come to him, and admonish him
that Silence must be preserved in this House. If the Prisoner doth not obey‚
the Keepers admonish him again. Ifafter this the Prisoner persists, the Keeper
opens the Door, and prevents his Noise, by severely bearing him with a
Stick, not only to chastise him, but to deter others, wh0, because the Cells
are contiguous, and deep Silence is kept, can very easily hear the Outcries
and Sound of the Blows. I will add here a short Story that I had from seve-
ral Persons, which, if true, shews us with what Severity they keep this Si-
lence. A Prisoner in the Inquifition coughed. The Jaylors came to him,
and admonilhed him to forbear coughing, because it was unlawful to make
any Noise in that House. He answered, 'twas not in his Power. However,

· they admonished him a second time to forbear it, and because he did not,
they stripped him naked, and cruelly beat him. This encreased his Cough,
for which they beat him so often, that at last he died through the Pain and
Anguiss] of the Srripes.

They infist so severely on keeping this Silence, that they may cut off every Gonsalv.
Degree of Comfort from the Afflicted, and especially for this Reason, thatP· 117·
the Prisoners may not know one another, either by singing, or any loud
Voice. For it ostentimes happens, that after two or three Years Confine-
ment in the Jayl of the Inquisitiom a Man doth not know that his Friend‚
nor a Father that his Children and Wife are in the same Prison, till they all see
each other in the A& of Faith. And finally, that the Prisoners in the several
Cells may not talk with one another, which, if ever found out, their Cells
are immediately changed.

If any one falls ill in the Prison, they send to him a Surgeon and Physi-
cian, who administer all proper Remedies to him to recover him to Health.
If there be any Danger of his dying, they send him a Confeffor, if he de-
lires it. According to the Provision of the Madrid Instructiom An. 1561.
