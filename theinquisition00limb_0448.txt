The tim-rom- of the INQUISITION.

tainly to understand, that we fhall proceed against y0u‚. by Authorz'ty of the
Lora, both spiritually and temporally, as a Defender and Favourer of Hereticks„

Anagni, 2 May, and fixth Year of our Pontificate. Moreover he exhorts the
Inhabitanrs of Viterbo, that notwithstanding the contrary Orders of the Sena-

tors of the City, they should proceed in an hostile Manner, to waste the Lands
of the aforesaid capellus de Chia. -

But in our own Time the Spanifh Inquifitors are endeavouring to extend their ι
'Power and Jurisdielion further, and under the Pretence ofConfiscation of Goods‚⁴
to seize on theirs also, who have any Commerce with the Spaniards, though
they live in other Countries not subjeet to thern, and have separated from the:v
Communion of the Church of Rome, because they have in their Poffeffion
some of the Effe&s of those who are in the Prison os the Inquisltion, or con-
demned by the Inquifitors, according to the daily Praetice of Traders and
Merchants„ Of thisthe Inquifition of Madrid gave a remarkable Instance a
sewi Years ago. Feb. 1687. Many Persons were thrown into the Inquifition at
Madrz'a’, accused ofbe ng concealed Jews. Amongst these were Diego and An-.
thony Dzaz, and Dan Damiamts de Lucena. About the End of. August 1688..
Sentence was pronounced against them, by which all their Effeess were con-
fiscated‚ and they themselves sent to solede, there to perform wholesome Pe-
nance. These Persons traded with Peter Poulle, a Merchant of Amsterdam,

who was neither a Jew nor a Spaniam, but a Christian, and a Dutchman‚ whort
had in his Hands several of th'e Effeets of these Spaniards. The Inquisition‚ in

order to possess themselves of those Etstffl, which were not subje& to their·

Power, discovered by private Enquiry, that this Dutch Merchant traded with
several Spamfh Merchants‚ and that he had a great many Effeers in their

fiands, and therefore ordered them all to be seized by .the Receiver of the for--

selred Goods‚ till they had the Value os those Effec‘ssm which the Amsterdams
lMerchant had in his Custody ·‚ and gave this Real'on for the forcible Seizure‚.;

that the imprisoned Personshad a Claim upon the Estate of the Dutchmaa, and-
that their (Elaim was devolved upon the inquisition, and that therefore they had:
the same Right as the Prisor-ers themselves to attach the others Effefrs, where-
ever they could be found in Spain .· However, this Endeavour was in vain, be·
cause no Confiscation can be just, of such E{2e&s w-hich are in the Poffeffion of.
another Person, who lives out of the Territories of the Judge, and is not sub-⁹⁴
ie& to his J'urisdiffion ·‚ and therefore the Lords of the united provinces, at

”the Information and Request of the Amsterdam Merchant‚ obtained that those. κ

Effeers should be restored to him.

This Punilhment of Confiscation is inflie‘ted upon all who are convist of'
Heresy‚ or confess, whether they repent, orpersist in their Heresy‚ because they
are declared to incur the Punishment, ipsojure‚ as soon as they fall into Heresy.-

But ifany return oftheir own Accord to the Chumh, before they are ac-

cam. 148.cused or denounced‚ or immediately after their being seized give a full and
θη 3 Part. genuine Confeffion of themselves, and of all others whom they know to be He-

wire&

reticks‚ and who return with a pure Heart‚ before the Depofitions ofthe Wit-
neffes are made publick, as they may be, gracioussy saved from Imprisonmenfg
