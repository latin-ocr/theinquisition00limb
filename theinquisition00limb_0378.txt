But although the Inquisitors may thus proceed against all religious and ex.‹
empt Persons, yet there are some religious against whom private Inquifitors
are not eafily allow’d to proceed, because of the Prerogative of their Dignity,
Such are the Masters General of Orders, of the Predicants‚ Minors, and the
like ·‚ and also the Masters General of the Military Religions. When such
are to be proceeded against, the proper Way iS‚ first to inform the Inquifi-
tors General, who, upon taking Cognizance of the Cause, must decree what
is necessary to be done, unless the Criminal attempts to escape, and their ap-

reff. Ρεῗὲῑῇηᾶεῃὲρζὴιέ Ειὲῗιῖίῇῑοῑ hath Power to proceed against Priests. Moreover,

. 31· And finally, they may proceed against all Laicks whatsoever, without Di· ,
stinffion, insected, suspected, or defamed of Heresy, of every Condition, not
excepting Princes and Kings. In the latter Case they think it safer, when
they proceed against Princes and Nobles that are Hereticks, or suspeeted oft
Heresy, to consult the Pope‚ according to whose Will, and Manner prescrib'd
by him, they must proceed against them : Not for that they think any De-
ference is due to Nobility, which is forfeited by Heresy, but to prevent Scan-
dal. For if the Inquifitors should publickly animadvert‚ on NobleS, Consuls,
and Magistrates, they might easily be hinder’d, especially in suspected Places,
and where the Inquifitors are poor and weak.

Moreover, they may proceed against all Persons whatsoever, of every
Condition ; and whatsoever Privileges they enjoy, if they any ways obstruet
the Office of the Inquifition, Thus Alexander IV. commands in his Bull, be-
ginning, Cupientes. Let all Contra—venem be punifh'd by the Ecclesiastical Censure„
without any Regard to their Appeal: Any Privileges or Indulgences whatsoever,
granted by the said See, or hereafter to be granted, specially or generally, under what-
J‘oever Expreffion or Farm of Words, to any Persem of whatsoever Conditz'on, Dig«
urcy, or Degree, Religion or Order, or to any Conzmunities or Univerfities of Cities or
Places, te the contrary notwithstanding. For by these or any other Privileges or In-.
effulgentes, we would not have an Affair of so great Piety obstrue-ted. The same
Pope‚ in his Bull, beginning, Ne commiffunz vobis, commandS, That if the
Clergy and Religious do not affist the Inquisitors according to their Office and-
Power, they may be proceeded against according to the Canonical Sanctions,
any privileges to the contrary notwithstanding.

Cap. ut The Inquifitors may also proceed against those, who have offended in-

gzhgm‘· having offended any where else, are found in their Province. This is deret-2
