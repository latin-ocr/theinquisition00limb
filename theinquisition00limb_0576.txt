146 The Hrsromc ofthe INQulstrtoN,

Judments, who alone ‘avith God the Father and his Son, poffiffi’st a glorians Name.
Szffr us not to be Perverters of Justice, O thou who lovest thestriffz‘est Equity. Let>
natlgnorance dra-w us to the left, let not Fawur bend us, nor Regard to Office or
Person corrupt as, but jain us lo thyself effefflually by the Gift of thy only Grace‚ that*
we 'may be 0115 in thee, aad ia mlhing deviatefivm the Trutl) ·‚ ami as we are gather-
ed together in shy Name, st) let us in all Things preserve Jastz'ce moderated by
Piety, thas aar Sentence here may in nothing dzffer from thee, and that here-
after we may ohtam everlastifzg Rewardsfor our good Deecls. NVhen the Prayer is
ended, all answer Amen.

This Pmyer, in the Time of Carena, was recited in the Inquifition at Cre·
mana, by Cardinul Camporeus, Bissiop of that City‚ the inquisitor on his
right Hand ata Corner of the Table‚ and the Vicar General at his left at ano-
ther Corner, and the other Counsellors in their Order‚ all on their Knees..
But if a single Bishop only is present, then the Bilhop and Inquifitor fit at
the Head of the Table‚ their Seats being equal, in all the Inquifitions in Italy.
But the Bishop sits by Virtue of his Episcopal Dignity in the Seat placed on
the right Hand, and the Inquisitor in the other.

pmna These Prayers being over, the Inquifitor consults whether the Cognisance 012
1252, s’ 7· the Crimes which are denounced and proved by the Wstneffes, belongs to the
holy Office. If there be any Doubt of this, he must call in the Qualificator
Divines‚ who must give their Opinion written and subscribed with their own

Hand, that it may be inserted in the Process, as the Foundation of the Juris-

diCtion os the Inquifitor. If the Crimes are small, or the Propositions only
founding ill, scandalous or blasphemous, or which do not include formal He-

resy,no one upon account of these isimmediately ordered to secretlmprisonment,.

but must rather be confined in some Monastery, or in his own House‚ or Ci-

ty. If these Things were omitted, the Inquifitors might possibly usurp to

'A κει. ad. themselves Causes belonging to other Tribunals. Thus Carena relates, that
cap-7· on the first of August, Amo 1630. two Portuguese Women at Placentia recei-
ved the Eucharist twice3 and being interrogated why they did it, they an-
swered, because they apprehended, that as often as they communicated‚ they
obtained the Jubilee of a Part, as they call it. On this they were kept in the

Prisons of thoe Inquisition‚ and their Effects sequestr-ed. But when the Lords
Inqtiifitors found that the Cause did not belong to the Tribunal of the Faith‚

they dismissed thern from Jayl, and caused their Effe&s to be restored to

them. This Consultation with the Counsellors is recommended by the Ma-

cit-id Instrufflon, An, 1561. cap. 3. [Vhea the Inqztisttors have seen the Informa-

tion together, if they are prestat, let them consult as to the taking them up, which

would appear morejust if done will) the Advice of the Cozmsellors of the Inquifition,

if it conveniently can be, and it appears to the Inquifitors convenient and neceffary ·‚

„ and whatsoever is aetermam, let il be iaftrted in the Aas. ’

Carena, No one can be taken up without half full Proof at least, or such Evidence as
lib. 3· tit. is sufficient to put to the Torture‚ because the Imprisonrnent made by the In-
2- §- 6. quifitors always renders the Prisoners infamous. Eut isthe Person be other-
wise suspected, for Instance‚ if he be of the Moorifh Race‚ and hath been,
denounced..
