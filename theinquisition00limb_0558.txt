The HisToRY ofthe Inouisirxon.

CHAP. V.

Osthe three Methods os beginning the Proccfi· before the Tribunal ‘ff
the INQUISITION.

”fre-ff? F any appear within the Term assigned to discover Hereticks, &a to re-
L ⁸ l veal to the Inquifitor certain Matters relating to the Faith‚ such ²¹⁶ De-
nunciations must be received judicially. If so great a Number appear, that the
Denunciation of all cannot be taken judicially‚ the Inquisitor must provide
himself with a distinet Book in every Diocese, to write down in it all the De-
nunciations brought to him, the Names of the Denouncers and Witneffes‚
and the Town and Place where they dwell 3 which Book he keeps privately
to himself, that the Names of the Denouncers may not be discovered, and
they thereby come into any Danger.

65· When the Time of Grace is elapsed‚ the Inquifitor must caresully examine
the InformationS, viz. which have the greater Appearance of Truth, and
which Crimes are more heinous and prejudicial to the Faith. Where this
appears he begins to make Inquifition, by citing the informer, giving him
his Oath, and taking the best Information from him that he can. If he finds
no Appearance of Truth, he over—rules it, but however must not cancel the
Information out of his Book, because what may not be discovered at one time,
may at another. lf he finds an Appearance of Truth, he makes farthei·
In uifition. -

‹kow there are three Ways of Proceeding and beginning the Process. First,

Simanc. by Accusation‚ which must be preceded by† Inscription. Secondly, by Denun-

ἕ· ¹9·§·¹⁶· ciation, which must be preceded by a charitative Admonition. But 'tis now the

Custom in Spain, that Hereticks, altho’ concealed, must be immediately disco-

vered to the Judges,without any brotherly correffion. So that those who, under

pretence of brotherly Correc'tion, do not discover secret Hereticks to the In-

ouifitors‚ and those who advise them not to do it, are punished as Concealers of

Hereticks‚ and as Hinderers of the Office of the holy Inquifition. Thirdly,

chna in by inquisition, which must be preceded by notorious Suspicion. This Inqui-

ouen. sition is either General or Special. T he General is whensoever the Inquifitors

{gn} 5 vifit their Province, or when being newly created, they go to the Provinces

⁰ ' ¹ ⁰ decreed to thern, and begin to exercise their Inquisitory Office. For then

they publish general Edicts, to enquire out secret and uncertain HeretickS,

for the Exercise of which there is no Need of preceding Infamy. But the In-
quifitors are obliged, cx officio, thus to a& at certain stated Times.

* There is this Difference between a Denunciation and an Accusation. A Denunciation eloth
not disable the l'trson that makes it to bc a witness, as an Accusation doth-

† Inscription is a certain Iohannem, by which the ACCUstI‘, if hc faiis in his Preof, binds him-
selfto undergo the same Punisszmcnt, which the accused Person must, ifthe Crime he is accused
ef be sully piovcd. I
