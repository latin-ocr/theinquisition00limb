immediately fell-to wrangling and quarrelling, and were not rto be appeased
and brought to Temper, till Constantine interposed, artfully persuading some,
ssiaming others into silence, and heaping Commendations on those F athers that
spol<e agreeable to his Sentiments. The Decifions they made concerning ‘the
Faith ‚ and their Excommunications and Depositions of those who differed
from them, demonstrate also their affectation of Power and Dominion. But as
they had great Reason to believe, that their own *Decrees would be wholly in-
significant without the Interposition of the imperial Authority to enforce them,·
they ¹soon obtained their Defires, the Emperor readily confirming all they had
determined‚ and injoining all Christians to submit themselves to them.

His first Letters to this purpose were mild and-gentle: But he was soon per-

Vit.c0nst.suaded into more violent Measures; for out of his great Zea] to extinguish

Heresy‚ he put forth publick Edie‘cs against the Authors and Maintainers of
it·‚ and particularly against the ‘Novatiann Valentinians‚ Marcionists, and
others, whom aster reproaching with being Enemies of ‘T ruth, dcstruHiw Coun-

Jellors, and with holding Opinions suitahle to their Crimes, he deprives of the Li-

berty of meeting together for Worship‚ either in publick or private Places,
and >gives all their Oratories to the Orthodox Church. And with respect to
the Arians, ‚he ba'nished Arius himself, ordered all his Followers, as absolute
Enemies of Christ, to be called Porphyrians, from Porphyrius an Heath-en who
wrote against Christianity ς ordained that the Books written by them‘shoul‘d
be burnr, that there might be no Remains of their Dostrine left to Postersty,
‘and most cruelly commanded, that if ever any one should dare to keep in his
Poss'effion any Book written by Arius, and sswuld not immediately burn it, he
should be no sooner convieted of the Crime but he should suffer Death.

Thus the Orthodox first brought in the Punishment of'Heresy with Death,
and persuaded the Emperor to destroy those whom they could not easlly conver-t.
The Scriptures were now no longer the Rule and Standard of the Christian
Paith. Orthodoxy and Heresy were from 'hence forward to be determined by
the Decisions ofCouncils and Fathers‚ and Religion to be propagated no longer
by the apostolick Methods of Persuafion, Forbearance, and the Virtues of an
holy Life, but by imperial Edifts and Decrees; and heretical Gainsayers not
to be convinced, that they might be brought t'o the Acknowledgment of the
Truth and be saved, but to be persecuted and destroyed. 'Tis no wonder,
that after this there should be a continual Fluctuation ofthe publici< Faith, just
as t'he prevailing Parties had *the imperial 'Authority to support them, or that
wer should meet with little else in chclefiastical History but Violence and
Cruelties committed by Men who hadleft the'Sirnplicity of the Christian Faith
and Profeffion‚ enssaved themselves to Ambition and Avarice, and had before
them the ensnaring Views of tem'poral Grandu're‚ high Preferments, and large

Revenues. ”Since the sze that Avarice hath encreaspd 'in ‘the Chsstrches, saSyss
