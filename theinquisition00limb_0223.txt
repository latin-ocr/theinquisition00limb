Praife γε the Lord 3 he bent on his Knee, and said before him, Praise ye the Lord. The

That she saw a certain Person howing before Peter Autem, in her aforesaid Hoase 3

and then she was required to make her Amendment before the fitia? Heretick, as the

other did. And then fhe also began to bend the Knee before the said Heretick, and

he agreed with Peter Anterii, fshat he ‘would commend himself to him 3 that he might

pray to God for him 3 and began to bow the Knee before him .· And that Peter Auterii

fizid, Ye may not do it 3 for this z's not the Place3 and so sent him away, that he

Nor was this Manner of Salutation required only from those who were admit-

'Tis reported of them also, That they prayed on their Knees before and after
Dinner‚ leaning on a Table. This occurs in almost all the Sentences of the
Valdensen ’Twas also customary with them to say Grace over their Meat 3
because Perrin Faber was accused, that he eat and drank with the Valdenses, at fol, 109, t,
the same Table that had been bleffed by them.

{They used to compare themselves with the Apostolical Life and Perfee‘iion3 and fol. 128. h,
boast that they were equal to them in Merit 3 and that they prestrved and imitated
the Evangelick and Apostolick Poverty 3 upon which Account they obtained the
Name of the poor Menos Lyons..

Befides this, they had other Customs different from the common VVay of fol. υἱός
