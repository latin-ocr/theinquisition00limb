and certainly know that God is a jealous God, punishing the Iniquities of the Fa-
thers upon their Children. Not that we would exclude from our Mercy those, who
keeping themselves free from the Heresy of their Fathers, fhall discover their secret
Perfidiousness : For whatever Punishment their Guilt may receive, we would not

,ficbjebt their innocent Children to it. We hereby also declare our Pleaficre, that

we appoint the Friars Predicant of the Order of Predicants, to take Care of the
Faith against Hereticks‚ in all Parts of our Empire. We also take under our special
Imperial Protection, all others whatsoever, that shall come to judge Hereticks, and
grant them Leave to ge, stay or return, except those who are under the Ban of the-
Empire 3 and Wilt that none fhall injure them ·, but that they shall have the Affistance·
and Recommendation of all the Faithful in the Empire. We farther command all,
and fingular of you, that wherefhever, ancl to whomsoever of you they shall come,
ye receive them kindly, and keep their Persons safe from all the Attempts of Here-
cic-ks, who may lay in wait for them, and grant them your Advice, safe Conduzft and
Affistance in the Execution of Affairs, st) acceptable before God. And as to all He-
reticks they shall discover to you in their Jurisdittion, let them be apprehended, and
kept in safe Custody, till being ecclcfiastically condemned, they shall suffer the deserved
Punzshment 3 as knowing that in so doing, their Obedience will be pleafing to God, and
acceptable to us, viz. in affisting, with their utmost Endeavours, the fizid Friars to
root out of all the Parts of our Empire, this new unheard (ff, and infamous heretical
Pravity. And if any one shall be negligent and remiss in this Matter, let him*
know that he shall be unprofitable before God, and justly incur our highest Dzspleasure„

The second Constitution of the Emperor Frederick,

FRE DER Iex, by the Grace of God, ὅτε. T he Hereticks are endeavouring to
rent the ſseamleſs Coat of our God, and raging with deceitful Words, which declare
their schismatical Intention, strive to divide the Unity of the indivtfible Faith it
sels, and to separate the Sheep from the Care of Peter, to whom they were com-
mitted, by the good Shepherd, to be fed. T hese are the ravenous Wolves within,
who put on the Meekneſs of the Sheep, that they may the better enter into the Lord's

K Sheepfold. These are the worst Anggls .· These are Sons of Naughtiness, of the Fa„

ther of chedness, and Author of eceit, appointed to deceive fimple Souls : These
are Adders who deceive the Doves: ΕΤ hese are Serpents, which crawl in privately,
and under the Sweetneſs of Honey, vomit out Poison .· So that whilst they pretend to
administer the Food of Life, they sting with their Tail, and mingle the most bitter
Poison into the Cup of Death. Sl’hefi’ Setis are not now known b'y their ancient
Names ·, either that they may conceal themselves, or what is yet more execrable, not-
content to be called by a Name from amongfi‘ themselves, as the Ari-ans were from
Arius, and the Nestorians from Nestorius3 they call themselves Patarenes‚ af-
ter the Example of the Martyrs, who suffered Martyrdom for the Catholick Faith,
as though they themselves were exposed to Sufferings. These miserable Patarenes,
who do not believe the eternal Trinity, by their complicated chedness offend against
Three, viz. God, their Neighbours and Themselves. Against God, because they do·
not-acknowledge the Son and the true Faith. They deceive their Neighbours 3 whjlst
