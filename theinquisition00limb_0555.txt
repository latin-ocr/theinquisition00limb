 

The 1113-101111 ofthe [NQUISITION. 125

Whilst one of them is vifiting the Province‚ the other Inquisitor stays at Βὲνεὲἶ-
home, that all who come voluntarily may have Access to him. If they 'coinepffft' 3·
within the appointed Term‚ and accuse themselves, he treats them more9‘ ⁵8⁶
gently. He must not however admit them after the Manner of Sacramental
Confestim, but after the Manner of Confession in a judicial Court3 so that
they must declare their Crime before the Inquisitor, and the Notary take
down their Confeffion.

After such Confeffion, every one of them is interrogated by the Inquiff-pcgna,
tor, whether he hath adhered to such Errors, or only been in doubt 6011-1Νωῑ-ῙΜ111
cerning them? For how long Space of Time he hath continued in them?'· ²· 544⁰
From whom, and how he learnt them? Whether he hath had and read any he- ⁷⁷⁸ ⁶³ ὣστ’
retica] or suspected Books? What they were, from whom he had them, and
what 116 113111 done with them? Other Qestions are added concerning
1113 Accomplices in Herefies, that he may tell the Names of all those
Hereticks‚ or PersQns suspected of Heresy, whom 116 know& He is farther
asked, Whether he hath ever been inquifited, proceffed, or accused or denouna
ced in any Tribunal, or before any Judge, on account ofthe aforesaid Errors,
or other Things relating to Heresy? He is also admonished fimply to tell
the whole Truth which 116 knows‚ as well of himselfas ofothers ·‚ because, if
he is afterwards found deceitfully, to have concealed any Thing, he isjudged
as one whose Confession is imperfect, and as impenitent, and feignedly con-
verted. F inally, heis interrogated, Whether he repents of these Errors and
Herefies into which he h-ath fallen? And whether he 13 ready to abjure, curse
and detest thern, and all other Herefies whatsoever, that exalt themselves-
against the holy Apostolick and Roman Church, and to live for the'future
catholickly, according to the Faith of the Church of Rome, and devoutly to
fulfil the salutary Penance enjoined him ?

IftheInquifitor finds that he was before admonished, yet 116 13 10 be dealt with n. σου
111016 gently, because he appeared voluntarily. For such are said voluntarily to Lucem.
return to Favour‚ who come within the Time of Grace, altho’ they bavam-²⁷3
been admoniihed. For they don't appear to be forced, since they areffi'ssgfoe
apprehended by no one. Yea‚ ’tis the same if they come after the Time
of Grace, whilst their Cause is entire, because they were nott personally requi-
red, nor the Proofs against them received.

However, at their first Appearance‚ the Inquisitors must not write downff, 122-
that they appeared voluntarily 3 because suchAppearance, after Accusation,
altho’ the Person may not have been verbally cited, 13 1101 presumed to be
voluntary‚ nor made with a candid and pure Will, but is ratherthro’ Ter-
ror, and unwilling, thro' Fear and Dread of the Proofs, to avoid the ordina-
ry Punishments. However, it may be minuted down, that such a one ap*
peared not cited or called.

Ifthe Crime be entirely concealed, the Inquifitor- may. absolve him secretly, 77. 61,
enjoining him wholesome Penance. But 11 11 be not secret, and the Personam«,
