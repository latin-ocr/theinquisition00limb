226 The H1 STORY ofthe ΙΝουῐειτιοΝς

Advice of certain Prelates of great Learning and Wisdom, and published an
Index of the prohibited Books, and certain Rules, by his Letters, in Form ofra
Brief. The same Pius, in his Bull of March 24, 1564. says, That the In-
dex was presented to him by Order of the Synod‚ that it ssiould not be pub.¹
lished before it was approved by him. Wherefore‚ after it had been ex.
amined at his Command, by some of the most learned and approved Prelates‚
he approved it, together with the Rules put before it, commanding it 'to be
received by all, and the Rules to be observed3 adding this stri& Charge:
[Ve forbid all and fingalar, as well Ecclefiastical Persons, secular and regular, of
’ whatsoever Degree, Order and Dignity, as Lay, of whatfhever Honour and Dignity,
to read, or dare to have any Books, contrary to the Order of these Rules, or the
Prohibition of the said Index. And if any one fhall ab? contrary to those Rules, and
that Prohibition, by reading, or having the Books of Herehcks, or the Writings of

other Penalties in this Case incurred, ordained by the Apostolick Sea, and sacred δα-.
nons. Thus by the Command of Pius IV. this Index of prohibited Books
came forth, An. 1564. “ But because it was not received in some Places
‘¹‘ and Provinces, because some Books were prohibited by it, which learned.
⁸‘ Men could not be deprived the reading of without great Inconvenience ·,
“ and because some Things were obscure, and needed Explication‚ they made
‘⁶ certain Rules, to provide, as well as they could, for the Advantage and
‘³‘ Studies of learned Men, without any detriment to Truth and Religion.”
Hence Sixtns V. order’d it to be enlarged with many Rules 3 but died before*
he had brought it to Perfeffion, Clement VIII. commanded it to be retained,.
and enlarged it, and thus encreased and enlarged, he confirmed it, and the
Rules prefixed to it ; and commanded it to bc published, An. 1595. The first
oi these Rules is this ε All those Books, which either the Popes, or General Councils
have condemned, before the Year 1515. and which are not in this Index, are to be
looked on as really condemned here, even as they were condemned before. By the fourth2.
Rule, the common reading of the Holy Scripture is forbid, in these Words:
Since it is plain by Experience, that if the sacred Writings are permitted every
where, and without Dzfference, to be read in the Vulgar Tongzce, Men, through
their Rafhness, will receive more Harm than Good ·, let the Bishop or Inquzfitor
determine, with the Advice of the Parifh Priest or Confffr, to whom to permit¹
the reading os the Biha, transsated by Catholick Authors, in the Vulgar ‘Iongue ;·
according a5 they fhalljudge whether it be most likely that such reading the Scripture
may do harm, or tend to the Enerease of Faith and Piety. Let them also have the·
same Power as to all other VVritings„ But is any without such Leave‚ fhall pre-
fitme to read or have them, without first shewing the Bible to the Ordinaries, he shall ¹*
not receive the Absolution of his Sins. And as to all Booksellers, who shall Jell the
Bible transsated into the Vulgar Tongue, without such Leave, or by any other Method
fhallpublss? them 3 let them forfeit the Price of the Books, and let the Money be given

το pious Uses hythe Bishop 3 and let them bc subjefl to other Punishments at the Pjea-
