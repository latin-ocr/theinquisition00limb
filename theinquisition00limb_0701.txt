not to receive him by any Meam, altho’ he promises a thousand times his
Conversion3 both because 'tis provided for by no Law‚ and because Ex-
perience shews us that Persons thus received, seldom or ever become good,

Ifan Heretick impenitent or relapsed be present, the Bishop and Inquisitor,
in Presence of the Magistrate of the secular Court, Cap. Excommunicamus,

from the Ecclefiastical Court, and leave him to the secular Arm, or [ο the
JurisdiCtion of the secular Court. And the secular Court, which is in that
Place, receives him as one left to their Court and Arm. ls he be absent
and fugitive, he is by Sentence declared impenitent or relapsed, and cast out
from the Ecclefiastical Court, and left to the secular Arm ·, and whenever the
secular Court can lay hold of him, he is punilhed as one obnoxious to that
Court, according to the Nature of his Crime, Cap. ad abolendam, ᾗ, Prae-

If the accused Person be an Heretick impenitent and relapsed, all Reme· η, 205·
dies are to be made use of for his Converfion, and he is closely and carefullv
confined, and no one admitted to him. But he can’t escape Death. An'd
therefore they exhort him, inasmuch as he can’t avoid the Punishment of
Death‚ to consult at least the Salvation of his Soul, to confess and receive the
Sacrament of the Eucharist. Behold the amazing Charity of these reverend
Fathers, who when they delivera penitent Criminal to Death, are so solici-
tous about the Salvation os his Soul! But whether he repents or not, he is
delivered to the secular Court, with a very earnest lntreaty, so to mitigate
their {entence concerning him, as to prevent the Effufion of Blood‚ and Dan-
gero Death.
