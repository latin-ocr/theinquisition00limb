“ Forrn of the said Citation, he publiffied the Sentence of Excommunzca4
‘⁶ tion against them, and put the City under an InterdiCt. After this the Go-
“ vernor and Magistrate defired that the Sentence of Excommunication and
cc Interdidt should be taken off, and promised that they would obey the Plena-
‘⁶ sure of the Church3 and that they would give sufficient Security upon
‘⁶ Oath‚ and Sureties, to stand to the Law for all the aforesaid Enormities,
‘⁶ Offences and Injuries. This Security was accepted, and upon the Ap„
«ι pearance ofthe proper Sureties sor the aforesaid Community, each Person
‘⁶ being bound in a thousand Marks of Silver, that they should obey the
“ Commands of the Church, the Sentence was remitted, and they themselves
“ summoned to appear within the Space os one Month before Pope sisai lin IV.
‘⁶ by themselves, οι· their Syndicks‚ or their Procurators, sufficiently instrufted
*ί for this Purpose, in order to obey the Pope's Command for these Excesses‚
‘⁶ and to receive what in Justice was to be exat‘ted of them. They appeared
“ within the said Term before the Pope, but there was no farther Process
‘⁶ made upon the said Affair. So that Honorius IV. commanded the Bishop
“ ofParma to cite them again before him, to obey his Ordcrs, and to re-
“ ceive what in Reason should be appointed them, What was the Event os
“ this Process, and what was the Punishment inflidted upon the Magistrate,
“‘ Bzovz'us doth not relate.’'

Cordes, in the Territories of Tholouse. The Magistrate and People rose up

sons threw themselves in a very humble Manner before the Inquisitors at a ge-
neral Sermon of the Faith, submiffively confeffing their Fault, and begging
ζ Pardon for their Offence. They submitted themselves purely and entirely to
the Will and Order of the Inquifitors, declaring that they were ready to make
SatisfaCtion, and to receive and do Penance, such as they should think fit to
enjoin them. They pray to be absolved from the Sentences of Excommunica:

plication, moved the Minds ofthe Inquisitors to Mercy, so that tho’ the Ma·
