the Inquifitor by such kind of Protestations, Simancas adds these Limitations. ς, 6.

Suspicion also arises‚ that a Person thinks ill ofsome Do&rine or Institution,par. 3·
or Order of the Church, or some other Thing concerning which he must com. 23,
believe as the Church believes, viz. concerning the Power of the Pope, andP· 47²
PrelateS, the holy Religions of the Monks, the Rites of the Sacraments, and
other Things, ifhe treat thern unworthily, injurioussy and disgracefully; or
if he defiles these excommunicatory LibeIS, which are commonly called Ce—
dulones, by drawing nasty Figures upon them. Such Persons Columna Marsi-

Iius, Arch-Bishop ofSalernO, in a certain Answer contends, do belong to the

holy Office, because, by this Aetion, they seem to think wrong ofthe Power

of the Prelates, and to contemn the Censures of the Church, and to scoff at

and disgrace the Church which uses such Censures. Farther, if any one per-Lucem,

Church, and its Power, because he despises its Excommunication. But ifany‘'‘'⁷'
one be excommunicated for Contumacy committed, in a Cause of Heresy,

after a Year he is looked on as an Heretick, and may be punished as such.

Such also are suspetfted who converse with Hereticks, and from such Con-

Carena teaches, p.72. 24. §.7. n. 69.

A violent Suspicion, which is also called Juris and de Jure, is a certain
Disposition of the Law, presuming something, and determining upon such
Presumption, as though it were certain and known. Nor can any Proof to
the contrary. be regularly and direffly admitted against such Presumption -,
