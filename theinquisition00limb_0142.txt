Temperance, against which there is no Law3 and, after having laid down this as
Gal. vi, an effential Principle of Christianity, that neither Circumciston availeth any ‘Ihing‚

Faith which works by Love 3 he pronounces this truly apostolick Benediction,
16·As many as walk according to this Rule, Peace be on them, and Mercy‚ and upon
the Israel 0 God.
The samse divine and excellent Strain runs through his Letter to the Ephe4
Eph. gv· stans .· I therefore, the Prisoner of the Lord, befiechyou that ye walle worthy of the Vo-
1, &a cation wherewithye are called, with all Lowliness and Meekness‚ with Long-suffering
and Meekness‚ sorbearing one another in Love‚ endeavouring to keep the Unity of the
Spirit in the B'ond ofPeace 3 and the Tertn of this Union‚ which he lays down
is the Acknowledgment of one Catholick Church, one Spirit, one Lord and
Mediator, and one God, even the Father os all, who is above all, through all, and
31.²‘n all. T he contrary vices of Bitterness‚ and VVrath‚ and Anger, and Clamour,
