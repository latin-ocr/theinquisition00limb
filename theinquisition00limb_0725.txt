they were under, giving each of them a Blow by the Hands of those
Priests who attend him.

Farther, when the Inquifitors absolve and reconcile Penitents at an A& ofParamus
Faith, they make use of Rods, to admonish thern, that by Heresy they have‘· ι, e. 3.’

vises such Penitents to consider, with how great: Indulgence they are treated
because they are only whipped on their Shoulders, that they may σο awav’
and being mindful of the divine Fury, may take heed not to relapi} for [hg
future. The Rod also points out the judiciary Power which the Inquifitors ex-
ercise over itnpious Hereticks, and those who are suspected of Heresy, be-
cause aRod is the Measure by which any one’s Deserts are measured‚ and
therefore Penitents are whipped with Rods according to the Nature of their
Offence, whereby their Faults are weighed and measured. Farther‚ the ln-
quifitors use Rods, because, as a Rod at the Beginning is in its Nature flexi-
ble, tender and sost, but at last hard, blunt and stiff, so the Inquisitorg are
soft and tender, whilst Penitents, offending thro’ Frailty and Ignorance, re-
concile themselves·, but if Hereticks do afterwards suffer themselves [Ο be
overcome' by Wickedness, and fall again into the Crimes they have committed,
then they whip thern, and strike them severely, even to the burning of the
Fire. And finally they use Rods to establish and support the Weak in the
Faith, because Rods are a very apt Instrument to support and confirm the
Lame and Weak.

The Penitents carry in their Hands extinguished Wax Tapers, whilst thezbid.n.25‚
Inquisitors reconcile them, to intimate, that the Light of the Faith hath
been altogether extinguished in their Minds by the Sin of Herefy and Infide-
lity. These Tapers are made of Wax, whereby Hereticks profess (Risum te-
neatis) that their Hearts have been so melred, thro’ the Heat of Concupi-
scence, as to receive various Sects; and that as Wax grows hard by Moisture‚
but melts by Dryness and Warmffi, so they being hardned by the Moisture of
carnal Delights, have remained in Infidelity‚ but are melted as wax, and
converted by the Dryness and Heat of Tribulation and Penance inioined thern.

And finally, the Cotton of the Taper‚ and the Wax ol which ’tis made, and
the Fire with which ’tis lighted after Absolution, ssiadow forth, that the He-
reticks have denied Faith, Hope and Charity. But when the Tapers arc
lighted after their Reconciliation‚ this fignifies, that they profess they will
demonstrate by the Light of good VVorks the Faith which they have reco-
vered.

Farther‚ those who are reconciled are sprinkled with holy VVater and Hys-c. rr.
sop, in Token, that being brought out of the Power of Darkness, and het-'hm'
¹ving turned the Eyes of their Minds to the true Light of the Faith, they are
to ren-nain free from all the Snares and Calumnics of the Devil, that they may
serve God with greater Freedom.
