They have also Authority to excommunicate Lay Persons disputing con-
cerning the Faith‚ publickly or privately ς as also all who do not discover He·
reticks either by themselves or some other Person, as appears from these Let-
ters of the Popes.

Farther, the Power of the Inquifitors was formerly very great, because Cap. ω
they could reserve to themselves the Authority of encreasing or leffening thecommz'ffi.
enjoined Penances. We also grant you Power, when you fhall think it proper, 30 <ie haeret,

Qarrelling, i. e. if they don't bear their Imprisonment with Patience, or
if- there be any other Tokens, that they don't in all Things obey the Beck
of the Inquifitors. This the Council of Narbonae hath ordered the Inquifitors
to take Care of. Cap. 7. T his Restrifi‘ion always carefnlly observed‚ that it fhall
be lawfulfor you, or other Inquifitors, or those to whom the Church of Rome stmjl
think fit to commit this Affair‚ or those to whose Office it belongs, at any time, and
for every reasonable Cause‚ to add to, or take from the Penances enjoined them, ac-
cording to your Wzll and Pleaficre. Yea, this Power was given to the Inquisitors
by the Council of Biterre, Cap. 22. even though there should be no fresh Rea-
son for it. You fhall always retain this Power, of [ending the aforesaid Heretjcks
²0 Jayl, without any new Cause, when you shall judge it expedient for the Affair of
the Faith. Hence we find, that in the Book of the Sentences of the Tholouse
Inquifition, the Inquifitors ordinarily reserve this Power to themselves. When
they shew Grace to condemned Persons, and release them from wearing their
Croffes, and enjoin them other Penances in the room of this, such as Pilgri-
mages, vifiting of Churches‚ and the like, they add ; Resservingto our selvesfff 85&-
and Succeffors in this Office, the Power of adding το, leffining, and commuting in all
the aforesaid, andos enjoining them to wear their Croffls, if it fhallseem good [0 m
and our Succeffirs, even without any fresta Cause. When they bring them out Of
Jayl, and change the Punishment of Imprisonment into that of wearing the
Cross, or any others, they add3 Reserving to us, and every one of us, and our fil· 100, ,
