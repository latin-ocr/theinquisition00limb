Simancas also adds these Cases, of which some do not much differ from the Tit.
Cases mentioned in the above Writing of Ferram.

ἐς Heretick8‚ or hinders the Inquifflors, or obstructs their Office, or should
“ keep in his Poffeffion the Books of Hereticks, he may be pnnilhed by the
“ Inquifitors. Also by one of the Extravagant Constitutions of Niobolczs IV.
“ Power is granted to the Inquifitors of taking Cognizance of the Crimes of

Pope John XXII. alsO, as Bzevius relates under the Year 1319. §. 9. by a
Letter N0. 190. renewed the Constitutions of Clement. IV. and other his
Predeceffors‚ and by severer Laws encreased the Power given to the Inquifi n
tors against them 3 commanding that they should gather together and bum
all the Books of the Talaum, and punish those who were conviCted of execrat--
ble Blasphemies. In the Month of December following, by the Comtnand of ·.
Friar Bernard Guido, Inquifitor of heretica} Praviry, the Books of the Jews I''‘'7¹‘'‘J³{‘
ealled the Talnam, were as many of them as could be found in the Posses-fil· ’μ’
sion ofthc Jews, burnt at Thelozefe, after it had been declared by swnrn Ex-
aminers, skilful in the Hebrew Tongue, that they contained Errors and Blas-
phemies against the Lord Jesus Christ, and his most hely Mother the Virgin

Inlhe Kingdom of· Valemia the Inquisitors may proceed against the Jews, Royas,
or Saracens, or other unbaptized Infidels dogmatifing amongst ChristianS, espe-P- 1·

or circumcise Boys, or are Receivers of Heredem, 01· who compel any one
to deny the Faith, or persuade them to use their Rites or publick Ceremo-
nieS. But yet others think that a Jew, who says to a ChrIstizm, La fede
vostra efede di ξ Cazzi, i.e. Your Faith is the Faith οἴει n--v-——- οι· who
throws Nastiness upon the Cross which is carried in the Litanies‚ ought not
to be punis'ned by the Inquisltors, but by the secular Judge. ¹

And finally, Gregory XIII. An. 1581. published n Constitution, beginning, 0²³²'P-B1‘l·
Antiqua Judaeorum improbitas, by which he granted Power to the ImitvfinircWjj
of heretical Pravity, freely to proceed against the Jews in the following · “rs'' ‘⁴²²'
