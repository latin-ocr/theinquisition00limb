mand to the contrary notwithstanding! But you fhall give it to our Chamber, or to
any Petson, whom we or the Roman Pontzffs our Succeſjbrs shall appoint for this
Purpose. And this we command to be generally obfhrved.

From these Constitutions they infer, that if any temporal Lord, in Favour
of the Faith, ac‘tually doth these Things, or other Things equivalent‚ or
greater, or oflike Nature, to what the said Constitutions require, he ought
to have a third Part of the confiscated Effec‘ts ·‚ or more, if the Pope allows,
andknowingly permits it. And therefore in Spain the Effe&s of such as are
condemned for Heresy are rightly applied to the Royal Treasury ·‚ because
the King hath not only the Care of conitituting the Senate, which manages
in the Royal Palace all the Causes of the whole Kingdom os Spain relating to
the Punishment of this Crime, and os which one of the principal Prelatesis
President3 but also liberally su plies the Inquifitors‚ which the said Pre-
late appoints by the Papal Aut ority, and sends throughout the whole
Kingdom, to extirpate heretical Pravity, with all their Expences, and ,
every Thing else necessary to their Office. But as in many Places the
temporalLords do not grant the Inquifitors their Expmces, nor submit to
>those Burthens and Labours‚ which Innocent, Alexander, and Clement.1V. have
commanded, Pegtm doth not understand by what Right they can appropriate
to themselves the third Part of such confiscated Effe&s; and therefore thinks
that they ought all to be applied to promote and advance the Holy Office.
Especially as the Inquisitors have now their proper Jayls, their necessary At-
tendance‚ and their own Notaries and Ministers, to the greatest Part of whom
the temporal Lords give neither Subfistence or Salary 3 and when defu-ed, of-
tentimes refuse to do it. Yea‚ if the Inquifitor sometimes asks the Guards,
Apparitors, or Soldiers ofthe secular Lord, to execute any Affairs ofthe Faith,
to take up Hereticks, or carry them to Jayl, he will not suffer them to go,
>without first receiving the SatisfaGtion and agreed Price from the Inquifitors.

This Camillus Campegius especially urges with Reference to the Inquifitors of

“ Affairs of the-Office‚ that they cannot serve Religion or the Monastery‚
“ which is such a Detriment to Religion as ought not to be suffered. Add to
“ this that Religion, and the very Monasteries are greatly damaged upon

Hence he infers, that the Inquisitors may receive not only their Expences,
but also a Salary or Fees. And as to the Objeffion that the confiscated Goods
-of Hereticks are appropriated to maintain the InquisitorS, he answers:
‘⁸ That such Confiscation seldom happens, since the Effe& are restored to such
