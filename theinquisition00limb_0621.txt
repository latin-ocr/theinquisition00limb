 

The HtsToRY ofthe INQUISITION.

into the Affair, there arose at last great Suspicions and Presumptions against
the Hermit himself, after his own Depofitions had been privately‚ and at

. Leisure considered. His Depofitions were found inconfistent and contradic'to-

i ry, tho' he made them vpluntarily and freely, without any onc’s asking or

⁴ so expressly and particularly, as could not poffibly be done by any one who

was not the Author of it, or at least privy to it 3 whereas he himself confessed,

, after he had been informed against before the Tribunal, that he had neither

seen nor read it. And when a certain Person said before him, that it was com-

ἶ monly reported thro’ the City that he was the Author of the Paper, when
³ the Suspicion was infinuated‚ he immediately turned pale, and dextrou-ssy

ffiifted the Discourse to something else, without mentioning a Word of the
Affa-ir, tho' his Countenance was observed to fall. The Circumstances of-tiie
Person added to the Suspicion, as he was a Man of an ill Life and Behaviour‚
remarkable for Hypocrisy‚ and guilty of many Crimes. And finally the
common People were universally persuaded, and all affirmed, as with one
Voice, that no one else could be guilty of so heinous a Crime.

Upon this the Hermit was ordered to Jayl, and after three Admonitions
made on three several DayS‚ and upon comparing other Writings of his with
the Letters of thie Paper, finding that they> were exaCtly similar and perfec‘t-
ly alike, and that therefore the Hand andAuthor must be the same, he was
cited by the Fiscal of the Inquisition, and arraigned for the Crime, and im-
mediately ingenuoussy confeffed it, and began to give an Account of the past
Course and Manner of his Life, saying that he was a Religious of a certain
very venerable Religion and Fraternity, a Lay Brother, and Profeffed ; but
that on the Account of certain Differences and Qarrels therein he fied, and
had forsaken his Religion several Years. But inasmuch as he had not lost his
Regard to Piety and Religion, tho' he had changed his Habit‚ he travelled
to Jerusalem, and there vifited the holy Places, where, thro’ a peculiar strong
Affection to the Mother of God, he had received certain Marks on his Arms·
as a constant Monument of his Devotion. From Jerzsszlem he came to the lower
Pannonia, and in the City of Vienna built and dedicated a Temple to our La-
dy ofConception. After this he returned back to the City of Graamda, where
he had consecrated his Life to our Lady of ‘Trium-ph, and the Care oi her XVor-
ship. And that when he had found that there was nothing done towards finini.—
ing her Temple, and that the Devotion of the Faithful grew cool, he was
excited by these Motives to endeavour to encrease the Worssiip and Venera-.
tion of that sacred Place, and that with this View he fixed up the Paper filled
ν with Reproaches and outrageous Affronts against the Mother of Goth and
particularly direSted against out-Lndy of Yrimnph. And that he might pre-
vent himself from being suspec‘ted of the Crime, and throw it upon one ot :lze
Jewifh Race, who are more liable toSuspicion, he wrote in the Paper an high
Encomium of the Law of liffofes, and an Abjuration ofChristi.1nity. And 132
nallffithat no Pomgfzevze might be thought guilty of this Wicltetlnefs, {¹²³
