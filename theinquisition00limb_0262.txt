The HtsTORY of the INQmsmroN.

cite them both before himself, After hearing what they alledged in their De-
fence, he determined that they had been guilty of great Exceffes; and therefore
removed them for ever from the Office of the Inquifition, and added other Pu-
nilhments‚ which he wrote an Account of to the Bilhop, Governor, and Citi-
zens of Verona.

The following Year 1292. the Inquifition was erected in the Cities osz'enne
and Albona ‚ after the same manner as it had been appointed in those of
Arles, Aix, and Ambrzm. The same Year James King of Aragon greatly pro-

ι’. motcd the Inquifition in all his KingdomS. For by a Law made the 10th of the

Cal. oFMay he commands all the Officials of all his Kingdoms, already made,
or hereafter to be made, that at the Notification or Injunction of the Friars Pre-
dicants‚ who now are, or hereafter 111311 be Inquisltors of heretical Pravity,
they do, fulfil, and execute, whatsoever they shall command to be done, by
themselves or their Deputies‚ on the Part of the Pope, or the King himself,
whether it be to apprehend, or imprison Mens Persons, or any other Thing
relating to the Affair of the Inquifition. And he commands them to do
this as often aS, and wheresoever they shall be required by them, or any
one of them.

And that there might be no Place of Refuge left for Hereticks, Tribunals of
the lnquifition were erested up and down in various Countries : In Germany,
Austria, Hungczry, Poland, Dalmatia, Bofhia, Ragusta, croatia, Istria‚ Walachia in
Lo-'wer Germany, and other Places, to which the Power of the Pope could ex-
tend it self. The Austrian Inquifition was at first very terrible; for Paramus
relates from Trithemius, that in the City of Cremu many thousand Hereticks

Of the INQUISITION at Venice.

HE Inquifition at Venice was under a different Management. The greatest
T Part of the Christian World being in Arms, upon Account of the fierce
Contentions between the Pope, and Frederz‘ck the Emperor, Lambardy being
torn in Pieces by its own Qarrels, and the Marquisate of <1² reviso and Romaniola
divided between the Followers of the Pope and Emperor, there arose amongst
them various Opinions, different from the Roman Faith. And because many
Persons had fied to Venice, to live there securely and quietly, the Magistrates of
that City, to prevent it from being polluted with foreign Doelrines, as many Ci-
ties of Italy were, chose certain Men, honest, prudent, and zealous for the Ca-
tholick Faith, who should observe and enquire out Hereticks. Full Power
was also given to the Patriarch ofGrado, and other Venetian Bishops, to judge

of those Opinions; and it was decreed, that whosoever was pronoifflcedass
