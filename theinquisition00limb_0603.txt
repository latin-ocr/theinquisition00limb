ninth Hour, inan open Place, without any Covering on his Head, in his
Shirt, or Girdle, wearing two red Tongues, a Span and a halflong‚ and three
F ingers broad, before on his Breast‚ and two hanging down between his
shoulders‚ and his H-ands tied together3 and to be placed also in the same
Man-net, and to stand before the Gates of the Church of St. Saturninus the
Lord’p Day following, and the Lord’s Day after before the Gate of the
gilded Church3 and to wear always upon every outward Garment the said
Tongues‚ and never to go in or out of his Prison without the said Tongues
hanging down ot appearing, and to mend them when ever they were torn⁹
and to make new ones whenever the old ones should be worn out ; and the.
Moment he came down from the Ladder‚ to be carried and shut up, witlzm ’,ς
Uelay, in the Jayl near the Castle of Narbonne, there to remain sor eves. The
same Sentence was pronounced against John de Salvetate, a false witness,
ol. 8 ‚ 84.
f Se131tence is pronounced openly against false Witness‘eS, because t zv.
brought into publick View‚ and their heinous Wickedness is declared τ
the People, and their Design and Villany is discovered inexpress Wms„ ,
the Reason given and made known to all why they are thus plunished. But η’
such false Witneffes have done but little Mischief‚ they receive a lesser Pun sn„
ment ; for they are brought forth, wearing an infamous Mitte, with return-=
ing Hereticks, and other Penitents at the publick A& of the Fami, or pub-
lick Proceffion, when their Crimes are read openly, and they themselves basti-
nadoed or whipped, banished, or sent to the Gassies, ot punished with some
other extraordinary Punishment.

However‚ such false Witneffes are seldom punished in a mannerpropor-
tioned to the Heinousness of their Crime, for this Reason undoubtedly, that

they may not deter Persons too much from giving Evidence. The Auther off, ,

the History of the Inquisition at (ἶσα, gives us a memorable Instance of Jqs'hgh
Pereira de Mendes, accused to the Inquisition as a Sodomite, by a certain Ene-
my of his, who pretended himself to be reconciled. This Person had bribed
five of Pereira's Servants, who all, with one Mouth‚ testified, that they saw
their Master committing this Crime with such a Servant, pereira denied the
Crime, but the Servant, who was young, thro’ Fear of being putto Death,
confeffed it, tho’ never committed. Ρενείνα, as a convieted Person,
was condemned to be burnt. When he was brought forth in Proceffion at
the A& of Fami, he continued to protest his Innocence. Upon which the
Judges remanded him to Prison‚ and ordered him to be kept to the next A&
of Faith, in order, if poffible, to find out more exaffly the Truth. In the·
mean while the Witnefl'es were often interrogated, and being each os them
separately asked, whether or no the Moon shone that Night in which [luy
saw Perfira committing that detestable Crime, their Answers were found con-
tradic‘tory, and the Falshood of the Accusation discovered3 and being pu: to
the Questiom they confeffed their Crime, and declared their Master innocent,
But what was the Punishment infin-“ted upon the Author os so vill-mous s.
