The 1113101111 os the INQUISITION.

thatthat Nation might not 60016 hereby into Discredit, he added a very great
Commendation of the Calvimss'ick Sect, to which, as he now thinks, he was
moved by the instigaeon ofthe Devil. For he thought that by this Means¹
he should more easily bring the People into a more fervent Devotion, in order
to expiate the VVickedness os that Paper, and persuade them to celebrate the
most venerable, pompous, and magnificent Ceremonies in Honour of the.
Virgin, to finish her Church, and to 60616316 1116 Veneration and Worship
paid 1161, and finally 10 render that sacred Place famous forits being resorted
to by great Multitudes from that City 3061 the neighbouring Towns. And
therefore that 116 was so far from fixing up the aforesaid Paper out of an he-
1611631 Mind, and from believing the Errors contained in it, that he did it
with a quite contrary Design, and always intended hereby to encrease the Ho-
110111 and WVorship ofthe Virgin, as became a Man faithful to the Mother of
God‚ a Christian, and also a Catholick, and one born of pious and Catholick
ParentS.

When they had heard his Confer-non, and examined and finished his Cause‚
they did not think proper to put him to the Torture, for discovering his Com-
panions or Accomplices, and whether or no he acted with an 1161611631 Inten-
tion3 because mmy Circumstances and Presumptions concurred, whichnot
only gave Reason to think, but notorioussy proved that the Crimina] had no
heretical Intention, but that his only Design was to cause greater Veneration
to be paid 10 οῑιν Lady of Triumph, 11131 116 himself might be held in greater
Esteern, and so obtain 01016 liberal Alms. Nor did they think proper to de-
liver him over to the secular Arm, because he had fixed up the Paper to bring
the greater Honour to the Virgin, and because as soon as ever his Accusation
was read over, he ingenuoussy confess'd his Crime; and finally, because he
had implored Mercy with many Tears and Signs of Repentance, and, during
the Time of his Imprisonment, had undergone many voluntary Penances,
macerating his Body by Whipping, Fastings, and other Chastisements, and
was a Monk of a most venerable Religion, which had produced many Saints‚
whose Merits were sufficient to supply and excuse the Errors of others, at
least so far as to save them from Punishment. It was therefore decreed, that
the Criminal should come forth at a publick Ast of the Faith‚ if there was
any one near at hand3 or if not, that 116 should appear in some publick
Church with the Marks of a Blasphemer, with his Tongue in a Gag, that
he should, as one vehemently suspeeted, be condemned to the Gallies for ten
Years, and without any Stipend suffer perpetual Banishment from the City,
the whole Kingdom of Grcumda, the Royal Court, and five Leagues around
11 ·, 3061 11131 116 should be exposed in the Habit in which he was apprehend-
ed, and whilst his Sentence was reading with the Merits ofthe Cause‚ should
lift up his right Hand, fastened into an Iron Collar, and escape Whipping,
because he was 3 ReligiouS.

Thus we see that this Hermit came off with a leffer Punishment‚ because
by a pious Fraud he intended to promote the Glory of our Lady of Triumph.
