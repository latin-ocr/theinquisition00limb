tence, they can’tdeny it him ·, and they pronounce, that having diligently
-emmined the Merits of the Proces3‚ they find nothing ofthe Crime of which

hewas accused legally proved against him. There is extant in this Case a.
stuwi„ Dscree i] the Maa'rid Instruftiom An. 1561, cap. 54. If the Criminol over..
hiiensi. comes the Torture, the Inquifitor must then weigh ond constder the Nature of the
p. ιιι. profi, and the Degree and Form, or Manner of the Torture, and the Dispofition or

Nature anci Age of the tortured Criminal. All which Things considered, zf it ap-
pears thathe hafflfigfficiendy purged himseff of all Mares, let them absolve him from
any farther Process. But if there he any Reoson and Coufh, upon confia'ering the
aforesaid Circumstonces‚ to think that the Tortiire was not inflitied with due Rigour,
then 'let them z‘nflz'tl on him either a light or vehement Ahjurcztion, or some pecuniary
Peimlty. Altho’ this ought not to be done without great Confideration, and unleſs the
Proofs are not thought sufficiently purged off.

Botis, when under the Qestion, he confeffes‚ ’tis written in the Process,
after which heis carried to another Place, where he harh no View of the
Tortures, and there his Confeffion made during his Torments is read over
to him, and he is interrogated several times till the Conseffion be made. But

p, 7³« here Gonsalviits observes, that when the Prisoner is carried to Audience, the

⁹ make him pass by the Door of the Room where the Torture is inflicted,
where the Execotioner ssiews himself on purpose to be seen in that Shape of a.
DevilI have described before, that as he paffes by, he may, by-seeing
him, be forced to feel, as it were, over again his past Torments. The
Space ofTime allowed between the Torture and the Ratification of the Con-
seffion, is determined by the Madrid Instructiom An. 1561. cap. 53. Twenty-
four Hours after the T orture the Criminol must ratify his Confeffion, and if he re-
trafis it, the Remedies provided hy Low must be made use of. And at the time
when the Torture is inflibied the Notary must write down the Hour, as also the Time of
the Ratificcztion, lest if such Ratificcztion should he made the next Day, a Doubt may
mise, whether it was after or before the twenty-four Hours. If the Criminal ra-
tifies his Confeffion made under Torture, and the Inquifitors are satisfied of his good
Confeffion and Converston, they may admit him to Reconciliation, altho' his Confes-
fion was made under Torture. They must however prudently take Care how they re-
ceive ficch Persons, and consider the Nature of the Herefies they have confcffed,
and whether they have learnt them from others, or have taught them themst’lves to
others, upon Account of the Donger that may enfite hereby.

I am not able to say what was the Space of Time between the Torture and
the Ratification of the Confeffion made under it, formerly in the Inquifition
at Tholouse‚ nor whether the Criminal was dismiffed if he retraeted his Con-
feffion after the Torture was over. There is one Instance only os Williasn
cavallera, in the Book of the Sentences of the Tholouse Inquifition, who be-
ing in Court, and not under the Question or Torture, but in a different
Place‚ and before different Officers, and three whole Days after the Torture
was over, again confessed the Things he had before confeffed under Torture,
and persevered in thern several TimeS. But afterwards he retrasted all, saying,
that heconfefi‘ed thro’ the Violence of his TormentS, who yet is said to be

convicred
