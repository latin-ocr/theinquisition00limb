The H1sToRY ofthe INQUISITION.

Gafgfczlvizts M‘ontanus also tells us, in his Arts of the S panish Inquisition, Cap. ιο.
That the Inquifizors are sometimes prevailed with to use their Prisoners a little
more kindly, by some pretty Presents made by their Friends and Relations.
But this Mzttter must be dextroussy managed, that so the Inquisitor may not
reluse the Offer. The first Thing therefore is, to bribe one of his servants,
in which there is no Difficulty‚ provided it be done privately. When the ln-
quisitors themselves are tampered with, they generally answe‘r‚ That holy
Tribunal is incorrupt‚ and suffers no Manner of Gifts whatsoever to be re-
ceived. But they have generally, amongst their Attendanee‚ some Child of
their Brother or Sister, or, at least, a Servant that they greatly esteern‚ and
who is to be highly respected, and who only sees the Inquifirnr refuse the Pte.
sents offered to him. This Servant comes to the Prisoners Friend, and pri-
vately points out to him the Relation of the Lord Inquifitor. This is giving
him to understand, unless the Person be a Stock‚ that though before he in
vain attempted to corrupt the Integrity of this holy Tribunal‚ he may by
this Conveyance prevail upon the Inquisitor, though he would ⁴refuse to accept
the same Prelent when more openly offered him.
