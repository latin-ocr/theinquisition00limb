³ to the Papacy‚ and called Nic-helas III. honoured Cardinal Latinus Romanas,
his Nephew by hig Brother, brought up amongst the Friars Predicants‚ with

the same Office ofInquifitor General. After his Death, in the Time of Ce-

l lestine V. the Office was vacant, and so continued till the Papacy of Clement

VI. who conferred it on William of Tholouse, Cardinal of St. Stephen in Mount
Caelius. He burnt some Hereticks, and did several Things for the Inquifition.

= But because this Dignity was not as yet fixed to the College of Cardinals, nor
« another primary Inquifitor immediately created by the Pope upon the Death of

the former, as the Neceffities of the Church of Rome required, the Inquisitors
were again involved in the same Difficulties as before 3 especially at the Time

’ when the Doctrine of Luthe7·‚ which had spread it self through all German-3,

 

began to appear in Italy also. And therefore the Cardinals John Peter Gai-affer,

ἵ and John Alvarez Teleda, persuaded Pope Paul III. to confer the Office of ⁴ In-

quisitor Genera} upon forne certain Cardinals.

Upon this, in the Year 1542. Pope Paul III. by a Constitution beginning, Eunai:
Licet ab initio, deputed fix Cardinals, Inquifitors General of heretical Pravity, Bauius„
in all Christian Nations whatsoever, as well on one Side as the other of the α· 1442-

] Alps ,3 and gave them Authority to proceed without the Ordinaries, against ansl- 7·

Heredeks, and suspected of Heresy‚ and their Accomplices and Abettors,
of whatsoever State, Degree, Order‚ Condition and Fre-eminence, and to
punish them, and confiscate their Goods: To depute a Procurator Fiscal,
Notaries, and other officials, neceffary to the aforesaid Affair: To degrade
and deliver over to the Secular Court by any Prelate deputed by them, the
Secular and Regular Clergy in holy Orders t To curb Opposers, to call in
the Affistance of the secular Arm, and to do every Thing else that should be
neceffary: To substitute every where Inquifitors, with the same, or a limi-
ted Power t To take Cognizance of Appeals from other Inquifitors to them 2

To cite, forbid, and absolve, in the Court, and out of it, fimply or con-

ditionally, from all Ecclefiastical Sentences, Censures, and Punishments, all

that should appeal to them. In this Manner he ordains all Judgments to
proceed, and annuls every Thing to the⁴contrary 3 adding withal a penal
Sanfleion, that if any one shall break this Decree, or presume to dare to con-
tradi& it, let him know that he shall incur the Indignation of Almighty

God, and of St. Peter and Paul his Apostles.

Pius IV. afterwards enlarged the Power of these Cardinals, ceneral Inquisi- Bul-'²3'-

tors ofheretical Pravity. For in the Year 1564. April, Id.37. by a Consti-{Z‘J‘gffiff
