Protestant, to send Evidence to a Popilh Court, to put a Protestant to Death 3
especially confidering that Servetus could not differ more from Calvin than Cal-
vin did from the Papists, their common Adversaries, and who certainla· de-
served as much to be burnt, in their Judgment, as Ser-vetus did in Ca.'··oi;2⁵s.
Befides this, Servetns farther charges him with writing to one sz'lliom Trie
at Lym-c, to furniss] the Magistrates of that City with Matter of Accusation
against him. The Author of the Bibliotheque besorementioned, says, this is a
meer Romance, dressed up by Sere-etus. I confess it doth not appear to me in
so very romantick a Light, at least Calvin’s Vindication of himself from this
Charge doth not seem to be altogether sufficient. He says, ’Τίς commonly re-
ported, that I occastoned Servetus to be apprehended at Vienne, on which Accounr,
'tis said hy many, that I have aHed di onourahly, in thus expofing him to the morta!
Enemies of the Faz'th, as though l had thrown hz'nz into the Mouth cf the [Volves.
But, I beseech yon, how come I, so suddenly, into such an Intimczcy with the Pope's
Officers ? ’Τίς very likely, truly, that we should correspond together by Letters 3 and
that those who agree wilh me, just as Belial doth with Jesns Christ, should enter into
a Plot with their mortal Enemy, as with their Compam'on .· T his filly Calumny will
fall to the Ground, when I shall say, in one Wom', That there is nothing in it. But
how doth all this confute Servetus's Charge? For whatever Differences there
might be between Calvin and the Papists in some Things, yet, why might he
not write to the Papists at Vienne to put Servetus to Death for what was equally
counted Heresy by them both, and when they agreed as the most intimate
Friends and Companions in the Lawfulness of putting Hereticks to Death.
What Calvin says of the Absurdity of an Intimacy and Conspiracy with him
their mortal Enemy, is no Absurdity at all. Herod and Pontius Pilate, tho'
Enemies, agreed in the Condemnation of the Son of God. Befides, 'tis cer-
tain, tha-t the Magistrates at Wenne had Servetus’s Manuscripts sent to them
from Geneva, either by Calvin, or the Magistrates of that City·, and when
Servetus was afterwards apprehended at Genevcz, the Magistrates there sent a
Mefi‘enger to Vienne, for a Copy of the Process that had been there carried
· οη against him, which that Mefl‘enger received, and aetually brought back to
Geneva. So that nothing is more evident, than that there was an Intimacy
and Conspiracy between the Protestants of Genevcz and the Papists at Vienm’,
to take away the Life of poor Servetus 3 and that, though they were mortal
Enemies in other Things, and as far different from one another as Christ and
Belial, yet that they agreed harmonioussy in the Doctrine and Praffice‘nf Per-
secution‚ and were one in the Defign and Endeavour of murthering this unhap-
py Phyfician. And though Calvz'n is pleased magisterially to deny his having
any Communication by Letters with the Papists at Vienne‚ yet, I think, his
Denial far from sufficient to remove the Suspicion. He himself expressy says,
that many Persons blamed him for not acting honourably in that Affair; and
the Accusation was supported by Servetus's Complaint, and by what is a much
stronger Evidence, by the original Papers and Letters which Servetus had sent
to Calvin‚ which were actually producedby the Judges at Vienne, and recited

in the Sentence as part of the Foundatiin os his Condemnation. And ashqalyn'l}
