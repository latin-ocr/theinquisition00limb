flamiam, was false and forged, and that she was persuaded to this Villany by

the Solicitations, Promises and Gifts of M. Henry Theodora, Consul of Amster-
(savz, and of M. Florentius, Parson of the Old Church in that City‚ and being
brought to the Place of Puniihment, {he publickly declared the same before all
the specstators. Consul Henry however denied every Thing, and because he
could not be convicted by any Thing under his own Hand, he destroyed the
Evidence of the W'itneffes against him, by pleading that they were perjured,
and by this Means escaped with his Life. He was however kept Prisoner for
along while, but at last dismissed, upon giving Security and Bail. This was

¹the Punishment inflicted by the secular Judge. Ifthe Inquisitors would pro-

ceed with the same Rigour against false Witnesses‚ so many miserable and in-
nocent Creatures would not be destroyed by false Informations and Evidence.

,But they had rather entice Persons with hope of impunity‚ and when the

Falshood of the Evidences appears so plain, as ,not to be palliated‚ they chuse

‚to inflict on them a ssight Punishment, rather than deter them from becoming
j‘Evidences, by a Punissiment just and proportioned to their Crime.

H E Witneffes having been re-examined‚ a Copy of the Proofs brought

against the Criminals is usually given to them, that they may the sooner
determine, whether they will give up the Cause, or stand Trial, and in this
Case the following Things are observed in this Court. F irst, that the Depo-
fitions be literally given to the Criminal as made by the Witneffes, that he
may fully understand what every Witness hath deposed against him, so that
'tis not sufficient to give them him in short. Secondly‚ The Depofitions are
not to be confounded or mixed, but each of them to be distinc'tly and sepa-
rately from others given him in Writing, that the Criminal may the better un-
derstand thern, and severally answer them, and thus be able the better to
defend himself. Thirdly, The Names of the Witneffes are not to be give-n
him, nor their Surname5‚ nor any circumstances by which he may discover
who they are, because such Discovery might occasion great Danger either to
the Witneffes or the Inquifition, upon account ofthe Power of the Persons ac·-
cused, by reason of their Family‚ Riches, or Malice. The supi-eam Senate
determined the same, with respect to the Answers of the Witnefl‘es to the In-
vterrogatories of the Criminals, ordering they should -not be given them, if
the Witneffes were in Danger of being discovered hereby. For the same
Reason they add the Year and Month, but not the particular Day when the
'ffrffitneffes affirm the Crime to oe committed. Thus also the Place is added
