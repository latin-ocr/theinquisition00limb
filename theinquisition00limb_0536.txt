*106 The Hm-omr of the INQulsl-rmn.

As to Crimes of ι the first sort, respeffing thern as well as Christians such
are declared· Heretxcke who deny God to be Almighty. If they ’confess
that they saud and belleved this, they are compelled to abjure as for· formal
Heresy. If they confess they said it, but deny that they believed it they
must be ‘tortured as· to their Intention‚ and be made to abjure {s well
as kPhristmns, accordmg to the Degree of the Suspicion‚ whether light or
ve ement.

As to Crimee of the second sort, they are tortured only to get out the
Truth‚ and d‘11cover their Accompliees. For in these Things they are not
truly Hereticks·‚ but because they grievoussy offend against the Christian or·-
Popsh Ruth, they are usually puniffied in a very severe Manner; and in
this Case they are not compelled to abjure,-because the Church doth not
compel them rothe Faith.

The Punishments which the Inquifitors inst-i& upon the Jews who offend
in the aforesaid Cases, are various, and lighter or heavier, according to the
Nature or Degree of the Crhnes, viz. Privation of all Conversation with
christiam, Fines, perpetual Imprisonment, Whipping, and also. to be-deli2
vered over mto the Power of the secular. Arm„ “ ”
