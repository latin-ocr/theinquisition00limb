‘⁶ thinks, that if these Words are stricftly examined, they will import no..
‘⁶ thing more, than that those Causes of the Faith, which are left to the Plea-
“ sure of the Inquisitors, must bejudged and decided according to the San-
‘⁶ &ions of the Laws. And thus the Judges must satisfy their Conscien-
⁶‘ ces, because the W'ords of the Instruffions, as of all other Statutes‚ rem
“ ceive their Internremt30n according to the common Law. Now, accord-
“ ing to the Dispolition of the Law, the Judge must form his judgment,
“ not according [ο his Conscience, but according to the Allegations and*
‘⁶ Proofs. From which this is inferrecl, that tho' the Judge certainly knows in his
‘⁶ Conscience, that the Perfhn accused is not guilty of the Crime, yet zf he be convibled‘
‘⁶ by Proofs against him, the Jua'ge ought, and without Sin may condemn him. How·
“ ever, Paramus believes it to be safer, and more agreeable to Religion, for
‘⁶ the Judge‚ in such a Case, to excuse himself from affing, and to desire off
‘⁶ his Prince that the Cause may be delegated to some other, or he may thus

Z h ⁶⁶ delegate it to another himself] But Camillus Campegius thinks, that all.
ΞῨΙΞΜ ’“ Things, which the Laws have not so clearly determined‚ are left to the In-
‘⁶ quifitors Declaration or Interpretation ·, that whatever Things are obscure
‘⁶ and ambiguous, may be expounded and declared by the Inquifitor3 and.
‘⁶ that therefore whatever is not determined by the Law is committed to the
aptemran‘ Pleasure of the Judge.'' Soufiz gives a yet larger Power to the Inquifitors,
l 2. c 1-and allows not only that they can interpret what the Laws and Statutes have-
§— 11, 1²·r10t, if any Thing doubtful occurs, but that ‘⁶ when there are severally equal⁸²
‘⁶ ly probable Opinions in any Case, they may follow which they will, and
“ when there is no Scandal, judge sometimes according to one, and sometimes,
⁶⁶ to another. He adds, that ’tis more likely, that the Inquifitor cannot fol-
‘⁶ low the less probable Opinion, unless it happens to be more established.
⁶⁶ by Custom, and he knows that the Sentence will be repealed by the su-
⁶⁶ pream Council.''

'Tis also further granted'to the Inquifitors, ever fince the Beginning of the-
delegated Inquifition, that for the Defence of their Person and Family, and
the better to apprehend Hereticks, their Receivers, Favourers‚ &a they,
may have their Officials, and an armed Attendance, and bear Arms them-

of Privilege, unless such Privilege be wisely used, Clement V, in the Councilf-
of Vt'enne, about the Year 1310. confirmed this Privilege to the Inquifitors,
but took away the Abuse that had crept in. Cap. Nolentes in Clement. §.porros
,Moreovem we strittly forbid the Inquisttors, in any manner to abuse their Privilege
of wearing Arnzs, and to have any other Officials but such as are neceffizry ta
help them in the Execution of their Office. And this Privilege is so peculiar
to thelnquifitors in Favour of the Faith, and from the Hatred of heretical,
Pravity, that their Officials, who in Italy are called Craſs-hearers, and in Spain
Familiam, and who are commanded by the Holy office to denounce or appre-.-
hend Hercticks‚ or to walt on the Inquifitor whenever he commands it, may
carry Arms either by Night or by Day, any civil or municipal Law made, orf

ro be made, to the contrary notwithstanding. If indeed any one ihould rnaIlje a
