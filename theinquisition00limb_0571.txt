ff Of the Number of the WITNESSES.

S to the Number of the Wi-tneffes‚ ’tis generally believed [liat two Wit- Evam.
A nesses are sufficient fully to prove Heresy, and to condemn any οῃρΡ-’Ξι ψ,
for Heresy. But ’tis neceffary they should be worthy of Credit, and, ΜΠ com,
they say, above all Exception. Hence it is, that tho’ excommunicated peffifff'·
sons, and those guilty of the same Crimes, are not absolutely rejefflzd fr01112·t‘s'}2.⁰'
being Witneffes against Hereticks, their Defenders, Receivers, and all other §- 36]
suspeeted Persons, yet full Credit is not to be given to them, unless it appears
that they speak Truth‚ from probable Conjestures, the Number and Oua-

{iay gf the Persons‚ and other Circumstances‚. C. In Fidei favorem, de haeret.

The Informer or Denouncer is now also reckonedamongst the Witneffes.Simanc.
For altho' no Man can be Accuser and Witness in the same Cause, yet he who 2²¹9- §³7-
discovers an Heretick to the Judges is a legal Witness. For, as they say‚&·t·⁶40
sucha Witness is not influenced by any private Advantage‚ but by a Zeal for ς’ 55·
the most holy Religion, and for the publick Benefit of the Catholici< Church,
and with a View to· the Amendment of the Heretick. Nor can he have any
private Interest to discover an Heretick‚ but only as being of the Nurnber of
the Christian People‚ in which Case they affirm the Testimony of the Infor-
rner to be compleat.

SeyReral {mgle and entirely different Witneffes have no more Weight than ς, 63,
one 1tne s,

There are some who say that a Man may be proved to be* an Heretick by ς. 6821-
smgle Witnesses, as if one should witness against him for one Heresy‚ another
for another, and others likewise for other Herefies. In such a Case they as-
sert it will be proved in general, that the Man is an Heretick. But as par- ς. 70.
ticularHeresy can’t be proved by single and separate Witnesses‚ so neither
can it be proved that any one is an Hererick invgeneral by the same XVitneffe53
for by⁴ thelame way it might be proved that a Man was a Catamite in gene— §- 73,
ml, upon which occasion Simancas gives us a pleasant Story. A certain Per-
son, a Year ago, cried out, and said, it was proved in general by fingle Wit-
nesses, that such a one was a Catamite. Ι· remember, says he, Ιν answered‚
isthis wicked Crime is proved in general, let the Punishmcnt likewise be in-
flieted in general. Let the Ind'ividual'be safe, and, if you please, let the Cata--
mite in general be burnt.

Yet there are two* Cases, in which Heresy may be proved by single Wit- §- 75,-
neffes. The first is, when the Witneffes testify of the same Species ochre-
sy, but are different as to the Place and Titne. For they agree in the Proof
of the same Heresy‚ whereas the Place and Time are quite foreign Things,

and are not neceffary Circumstant-es to the Proof of Heresy‚ The secondl is, 9277.
