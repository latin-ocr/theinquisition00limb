Places or Cities he studied, and what Studies he followed? who were his
Masters? whose Names he must tell. What Arts he learnt? What Books
he hath had and read? and whether he hath now any Books treatino of Re-
ligion, and what? Whether ever he harh been examined and cited?³ 01· fuer]
01- proceffed before any other Tribunal, or the Tribunal of the holy inquii
sition, and for what Causes 3 and whether he was absoived or condemned, by
what Judge‚ and in what Year? Whether ever he was excommunicated‚ and foi·
what Cause ? Whether he was afterwards absolved 01· condemned, and sor wim-
Reason? Whether he hath every Year sacramentally confeffed his sins, how
osten, and in what Church? Then he is commanded to give the Names of his
Confeffors, and of those from whom he hathreceived the Eucharist, and e-
specially for the ten Years last past, and more. What Oratios or hoiy
Prayers he recites? Whether he hath any Enemies? whose Names he must
tell, and the Reasons of their Enmity.

If the Criminal is persuaded by these, or by more or less such Interroga⁹
tories‚ openly to confess the Truth,⁸ his Cause is finissied‚ because ’[151111111601ἣ
ately known what will be the Ifl’ue of it.

But ifafter all these Interrogatories the Prisoner persists in the Negative‚
and says he doth not know why he is cited or sent to Prisonff the Inquisitor
replies‚ that since it appears from his own Words, that he will no: discover
the Truth,and t'nat there is no Proof ofhis having such Enmities with any Pera
sons, or that there are no such Causes of Hatred as he alledges‚ by which others
could, or ought to be induced ssanderoussy, and falsely to inform against 111111,
that therefore there arises the stronger Suspicion‚ that the Depofitions against
him in the holy Office are true. And therefore he is beseeched and adjured
by the Bowels of Mercy of Christ Jesus, to consider better and better, and
ingenuoussy to consess the Truth, and to declare whether he hath erred m
Words or Deeds in the aforesaid Matter relating to the Faith, and the holy
Office, or rendred himself suspected to others. All these Things are pro-
vided for by the ‘seledo Instruffions, An. 1561. cap. 13, 14, 15, 16.

All these Interrogatories proposed to the Crimina15‚ and their Answers and
Sayings, as proposed and spoken, are faithfully and at large to* be written
down by the Notary ·, and if the Criminal can write, he subscribes it; if he
can’t‚ he puts the Sign of the Cross.

If by such general Interrogatorics the Inquisitor can’t: draw from the Pri- caen μ,
sonex· a Confeffion of the Crime uf which heis accused‚ he comes to parricu· ⁴ ³
lar Interrogatories‚ which relate to the Matter it sels, or the Crimes or He-
refies for which the Criminal was denounced. For Instance, ifhe was accused
sor denying Purgatory, then one, two, or three Days after his first Examina-
tion, he is again interrogated by the Inquisitor, whether he hath any Thing9
and what, to say besides what, he said in his other Examinatsson ? Whether he
bath thought better of the Matter‚ and can recollc& the C‘ause of his impii--
sonment‚ and former Examination, or hath at least any Suspicion who could
accuse him rothe holy Office, andos what Mutters? KVhether he harh
heard any one discoursing of Paradise, Purgatory, and Hell ἒ What he heard·
