the heretical Aibigenst’s in Fratue, and to destroy them, and convert their Fa· Bzovius,
vourers. He also wrote to Philip King of France, that he should take Arnas} ¹204·
against those HeretickS, and use his utmost Force to suppress them ·, that by 9· ²²·
endeavouring to prevent the Progress of their Heresy, he might be under
no Suspicion of being tainted with it himself. With the Pope's Legate there
came also twelve Abbots of the Cistercian Order‚ preaching the Cross against
the Albigenfhs, and promising, by the Authority of Innocent, a plenary Re-
miffion of all Sins, to all who took on thern the Crusade. To these Dsminfck
joined himself, and, as we have related, invented in that Expedition the Inqui-
fition. The Roman Pontiffs had appointed this kind of VVar, which they called
Holy, against the Infidels and Saracens, for the Recovery of the Holy Land ·,
and because all who listed themselves in that Service wore the Sign of the Cross
near their Shoulders, they were called Cross-bearers. They ordered i: also [ο
be proclaimed‚ that all who would enter into that Holy XVar, or pioussy con·
tribute any Money for the Pay of the Soldiers, being conseffed and penitent,
according to the Rules and Methods fixed by the Divines‚ should obtain a full
Indulgence and Remiffion of their Sins, and be absolved from the Sentences -
of Interdict‚ Suspenfion, and Excommunication, and especially from those they
had incurred by firing or breaking into Churches‚ or by la ying violent Hands2
on Ecclefiasticks, and from all other Sentences‚ except the Crime was so enor-
mous, that they could not receive Absolution but immediately from the A pot
stolick See. They were allowed also, in the Time of a General InterdiCt‚ to
be present at Divine Services, and to receive the Ecclefiastical Sacraments‚ .
in those Places where they were celebrated, by a special Indulgence from the “
Apostolick See, if they had been absolved before from their respective Sen- ν
termes, as may be seen in the Bull of Imzocent the F ourth, which begins,
Malitia hujus tempori53 that by the Hopes of this Immunity‚ Men might
be excited to undertake these Expeditions. Accordingly Multitudes came to-
gether, and chearfully engaged in them, upon the Belief that they could in
so easy a manner atone for their Sins. But now the Popes turned these Ex-
peditions against Christians themselves‚- whom they loaded with the infamous
Name of Hereticks‚ only because they were Enemies to their‘See‚ and the
exorbitant Power of it. Some of these Cross·bearers Dominick sent into the
Country ofTholoufh against the Albigeqs}s‚ to overcome those Hereticks by the
material Sword, whom he could not cut off by the Sword of the VVord of
God„ .

[For this Fraternity Dominick framed certain Constitutions‚ by which they ,-
were to preserve and govern themselves. The first waS, that such who en-
tered into this Warfare, should take a solemn Qash, that they would endea-
vour with all their Might [ο recover, defend, and prote& the Rights of the
Church· against all who should pretend to usurp them ·, and [nat in De-
fence of the Ecclefiastical Effec'ts they would expose themselves and their
own Estates‚ and take up Arms, as often as they should be called on to do it
by the Prelate of the War, who was then Domini-k, and afterwards the Ma.-
sters General of the Domiizican Order. Dominick sarther exacted an Oath ἷῑοζ
