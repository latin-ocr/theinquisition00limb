and learffii’d Inqutfitors may chuse a Method which they judge more fase, ami max· be
better uſsed in Prattice, according to the different Causes that may arist. ²

And lest thesentence against Fugitives may seem to be pronounced in vain, Rana,
’tis usually published before all the People, and the Image, or, as they com-1>.³2i.
monly call it, the Statue of the absent Person is publickly produced, onP· 574·
which there is a Superscription fixed, containing the Name and Surname of
the absent obstinate Person who is condemned, which Statue is delivered to
t-he secular Power, on which he executes the Senten‘ce and Penalty of Burn-
ing, as he would do upon the absent Person himself, ifhe were present, un-
less he would turn, or upon a Person otherwise relapsed. Thus, as Lewisl. ι. t. 2.
a Paramo tells us, the Statue of Sigesmond Malatesta was burnt at the Gates off· 1· ⁷²· 6,
St. Peter 3 and the Statue of Luther, after he had been cited, and did not ap-
pear, was also burnt, together with his Rooks, at the Command of Leo X,-
by the Bishop of Asboli, and Silvcsser Prieriates.

When this Custom of burning the Statues of absent Criminals began, is un-
certain. Pegna believes it not to be very antient, because neither Eymerick,
who, with great Diligence, hath treated of every Thing relating to Praetice
in this Crime, nor any other of the Antients, who have written· of the Order·
of proceeding against Hereticks, have mentioned this Custom 3 nor is there tor
be found any fingle Trace of it in the Vatican Copy, nor in that of the most
illustrious Cardinal SirlettO, where there are many Things, and even the molb-
minute Things concerning the Method of judging and punishing Hereticks‚

But yet he thinks it very commendable, and proper to strike Terror, ancl.

therefore altogether fit to be used. γ

Secondly‚ Ifbeing in Jayl for Heresy he kills himself, for by thus destroying
himself, he seems to confess the Crime. Thirdly, ⁴1f, th0’' when alive, his·
Heresy did not appear, and he was not accused of· it, yet, if aster ’1115 Deam,
it at any time appears that he died an Heretick, either by the Depositions and
Attestations of others, or by Faets, or Deeds‚ or Books composed by 111111,
or=by any other legal Reasons. This Process is carried on against the Πρω
