The Laws of the EMPERoRS, after the Nicene Council‚ agai->ss
the Arians and other Hereticks.

FT E R the Converfion of Constantine to the Christian Religion, the Ci-
L . vil Power became vested in the Hands of Christians. This Change in
their Circumstances produced as great a Change in their Dotstrine and Man-
ners ; and the degenerate Posterity, deviating from the Example of their An-
cestors, introduced into the Church Methods of Cruelty, not only equal to
those of the Heathen‚ but even greater than were ever prastised by them.
What gave the first Rise to it was, the Dispute between Alexander, Bilhop
of Alexandria, and Arius, a Presbyter of the same Church : When the News
of this was brought to Constantine, he first by Letters lharply reproved them
both: Alexander for being needlessy inquifitive, and Arius for his imprudent
Answers, about an unneceffzry Qestion, which arosefrom their want of being bet· 12·qu in

swafion of the Bissmps, or out of some political View, he called the Nicene
Council, that by their Authority the Opinion of Arius might be condemned.
Eusebius, who was present at that Council, was able to give the best Account
of it3 but he chose rather that the-ir Affions should be for ever forgotten,
and contented himself in a very few words to declare the Iffue of it : And if
we add to the Account given by him, the somewhat larger one given by
Socrates, it appears plain, that all who would not subscribe to their Decrees,
were condemned to Banissnnent , and there is no room to doubt, such are the
Frailties of human Nature, but that many through Fear were compelled to
subscribe. Some few indeed there were, who not at all terrified with the Fear
of Banishnient, went into Exile with Arius, whom the Synod had condemned,
because they would not consent to his Condemnation, The Emperor himself
put forth anEdi&, by which he ordained, that all the Books written by Arias
lhould be burnt, condemning to Death every one that should conceal any ofArius’s sam. 1.

After they had thus proceeded to Methods· of Severity, and civil Punissi-
