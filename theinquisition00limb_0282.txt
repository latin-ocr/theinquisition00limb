Bmvim, BOUT these Times John Wickleff arose in England, and not only op-

⁹· ⁸²³²* exorbitant power ofthe Roman Pontiff, vindicating the Rights 0f the secular
Magistrates, and teaching that the Clergy were not exempted from their Ju-
risdifflon and Obedience. The Pope‚ by his Letters to the Univerfity of Ox-
erd, commanded them hy Virtue of their holy Obedience, and under the Penalty of
being deprived of all Fuvours, Indulgencies, and Privileges, that had been granted
them by the Apostolick See, that they should not suffer any one to defend Wickleff's
Proposttiom, but should order W ickleff himself to be seiz'd, and send him in safe
Custody to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Bishop of London, or one of
them. He also by Letters commanded the said Archbishop of Canterbury and
Bishop of Londoa, that they fhould order Wickleff to be apprehended by the Papal
Authoritjx, aad commit him to Jail, aud put him in Irons under safe Custody‚
till fici-ther Orders from himself upon this Affair. And after mention of these
Things out ofhis former Letters, he farther commandS, That if the aforesaid
John, apprehending his being sez'zed and imprisoned, fhould ahswnd, J‘o that theyv
could not apprehend and confine him ·, chat then they should take Care peremptorily to.
admonish and cite him, in the Pope’s Name, hy a puhlick Eam, to be set up in one of
the Collcges of Oxford, then in the Dioceſse of Lincoln‚ and all other publick Places, to
appear aud ans-‘wer personally to his Propofitions before the Pope‚ where-ever he
fhculd be, within the Space of three Months, to he computed from the Day of this
C italien ·‚ adding, T hat whether the said John should appear or not, within the said
Tem, they should proceed against him upon the Premises, even to the Condemnation
he had deserveass according as his Crimes should require, and as they saw fit for the
Honour of God, aad the Preservation of the Faith. And in other Letters he com-
mands them, That they should endeavour to take Wickleff’s Confhffion, and trans·
mit it to him by a faithful Mcffenger, sealed with their own Seals, without shewing ic
to any one, and keep him in Irons till they should receive his farther Commands. Her
sent also other Letters to Edward King of England‚ by which he requires.
