The Hrs’ronv of the INQUIsvrroN.

“ tence: That he should come out at a publick A& os the Faith, carrying
“ a wax Candle in his Hand, be banish'd five Years from the City, and for·
“ seit the whole Sum of Money, which by Virtue of his Office he was to
“ have received from the holy Tribunal.

’ “ This very Man, whilst he was Keeper, had in his Family‚ an ancient
“ Servant Maid, who observing the Distress of the PrisonerS, labouring un-
“ der intollerable Hunger and Nastiness, through the Wickedness and Bar-
“ barity of her Master‚ was so moved with pity towards them, being her sels
“ well inclined to the Evangelical Piety, that she often spoke to them through
“ the Doors of their Cells, comforted them, and as well as she could ex-
“ horted them to Patience, many Times putting them in Meat under their
‘ Doors, in Proportion to the mean and low Abilities of her Condition.
“ And when she had nothing of her own, by which to shew her Liberality
“ to the Prisoners of Christ, she stole good Part of that Provifion from
“ the wicked Thief her Meister, which he had stolen from the Prisoners‚ and
“ restored it to them. And that we may the more wonder at the Providence
“ of God, who so orders it that the worst of Parents shall not have al-
“ ways the worst of Children, but sometimes even the best ς a little Daugh-
“ ter of the Keeper himself was greatly affifling to the Maid in these pious
“ Thefts. By Means of this Servant the Prisoners had Information of the
‘⁶ State of the Affairs of their Brethren and fellow Prisoners‚ which much
“ comforted them, and was oftentimes of great Service to their Cause. But
‘⁶ at length the Matter was discover’d by the Lords Inquifitors‚ by whom
“ she was thrown into LPrison for a Year, and underwent the same Fate
“ with the other Prisoners‚ and condemned to wall< in the publici< Proceffion,
“ with a yellow Garment‚ and to receive two hundred Stripes, which was
“ executed upon her the following Day through the Streets of the City‚ with
“ the usual Pomp and Cruelty. To all this was added Banilhment from
“ the City and its Territories for ten Years. Her Title was, The Favouress
“ and Aidress of Hei-eticles. What excited the implacable Indignation of the
“ Lords, the Fathers of the Faith, against her, was, That they discovered
“ in her Examination, that she had revealed the Secrets of the most holy
“ Tribunal to some of the Inhabitants of the City, particularly relating to
“ the Provision allotted to the Prisoners‚ From both these Examples, and
“ from their different and unequal Punishment, any one may see, how much
“ safer it 'rs to add to the Affiietion of the Prisoners in their Jayl, than to
“ comfort them by any A& of Humanity and Mercy whatsoever.

And in order that the Jayl of Hereticks may be kept secret, no one of

the Officials, no not the Judge himself, as we shall afterwards see, can en—
ter it alone, or speak with the Prisoners but before another of the Officials,
nor without the previous Order of the Inquifitors. All are obliged to swear
that they will observe this, that no one may see or speak to the Prisoners be-
sides the Person who gives them their Neceffaries, who must be a faithful ho-
nest Person, and is obliged to sware that he will not discover the Secrets‚

aPndsmust be searched to prevent his carrying any Orders or Lettcrs to the
ri oners. This
