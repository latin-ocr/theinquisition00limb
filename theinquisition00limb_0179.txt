recited ir, he adds : A Law tritly worthy of an Emperor that was a Spaniard, as
though it was the Glory of Spain to exceed all Nations in Cruelty, and its Ι-Ιο·
nour, even in former Ages, to have been as remarkable for usmg severer Me-
thods of Punilhments in this World to miserable Hereticks than others, as they
now are for the Barbarities prafflsed by the bloody Tribunal of the Inquifi-
tion. The Emperors Honorias and ‘Theodostns also, Cod. Ne Sant‘t. Baptisnia ite·
retur, l. 2. thus command : ff any one shall be discovered to have rebaptized any
of the Ministers of the Catholick Party‚ let him be pat to Death‚ both the Person
gigilty (osbthilsy execrable Impiety (if he he of an Age capable of Guilt) and the Party
e nce im.

s And that there might be no Remains of the Opinions condemned by the
Synod, and to prevent their being transmitted to Posterity 3 it was prohibited
by the severest Laws, either to keep or transcribe any of their Books. We
have seen before the Law of Constantine, against all who should conceal any of
Arins’s Books3 and another Edi& of Martian‚ against the Books of Ea-
tyches. Theodosias published such another Law against the Books of Nestorius,
after he had been condemned in the Council of Ephesiis, l. Dainnato‚ c. a'e Hee-
reticis ε Let not any one dare to keep, or read, or transcribe the impions Books of
the accursed and execrable NestoriuS, written against the venerable orthodox Party‚
ancl the Decrees of the most holy Council of Prelates at Ephesus ; and we ordain that
they be diligently songht after, and puhlickly barnt. Justinian also forbids the
transcribing any heretical Book3‚ under the Penalry of having the Hand cut:
off. For after that Anthimas had been condemned in the fifth Synod‚ he made
this Law against his Books. Novel42. cap. 1. We prohibit all to keep any of
his Books .· And as it is not lawfnlfor any one to write, or have in his Poſjeffion the
‚Books of Nestorius, according as the Eniperors, oar Preduffrs, have thought fit
in their Constitutions to ordain, with respet? to the Sayings and Writings of Porphyry
against Christianity3 so let nothing said or written by Severus remain in the Post
sefflon of any Christian ; bnt let them be ahhorred as profane by the Catholick Charch,
and burnt by those that have them, unleſs they are willing to stffir the appointed Pe-
nalty. Let them not therefore be transcribed by the Notaries of any Sort, as know-
ing that the Punishment of those who shall write any of his Books, fhall be the Loss
vof their Hand. From these several Laws, Conrad Brunas infers, that the
Schools of Hereticks are to be destroyed thus t ‘⁶ The Schools of Hereticks Brun, l. 6.
