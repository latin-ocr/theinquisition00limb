into a perfett Man, and may not hurt one another in the Fellowfhip and Communion
qs this Life, nor give Occafion of Offence to each other, but rather being joined in the
Bond of Charity‚ as Members osone Body under Christ the Head, and his Vicar up-
on Earth the Roman Pontzff, the Succeſjbr of the most bleffed Peter, from whom the
Unity of the whole Churchflows, may encrease unto Edfication, and may thus, with.
the Affistame of divine Grace, fit enjoy the Qiet of the present Life, as that they may
obtain the Bleffedneſs of the future. For which Causes the Roman Pontiffiv, our Pre-
deceffitrs, have, on this Day, celebrated for the anniverfizry Commemoration of the
