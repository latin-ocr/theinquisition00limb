him inflexible to all his repeated Entreaties, he got a 5111οᾄ ω meet in
Bitbvnia, from whence they wrote Letters to the other Bishop‘s‚ to engage
1116111 to receive the Arians to their Communion, and to persuade Alexander to
do the same, But all their Endeavours proved ineffectual, and by these un-
friendly Dealings the Parties grew more enraged against each other, and the
Qarrel became incurable. ”

’Tis, I confess, not a little surprizing, that the whole Christian World
should-be putinto such a Flame upon account 01 a Dispute of so very abstruse
and metaphysica} a Nature, as this really was in the Course and Management -
of it. Alexander's'Doctrine, as Arius represents it in his Letter to Eusebius of
Nicomedia, was this, ε Gadis alwajo’, and the Son always. ‘Ihesame ‘T ime the Fa· Theod.
ther, the same Time tbe Son. {Ibe Son co-exilts with God unbegottenly, being everff'5H· 1· ¹· ’
begotten, being tmbegottenly begotten. T hat God'was not before the Son, no not in Con- ’ ’
ception, ar tlse least Pointof Time, he being ever God, ever a Son. For the Son is ·
out ofGod himseff. Nothing could be more inexcusaffle, than the tearing the
Churches in pieces upon account of such high and subtle Points as these, ex-
cept the Conducst of Arius, who ori the other hand asserted, as Alexander, his
Bilhop, in his Letter to the Biihop os Constantinople, tells us, d That there was atd. l. 1,
Ume when there was no Son eff God, and that he who before was not, afterwards c. 4-
exzsted, being made, when saever be was made, just as any Man whatsbever‚ and that
therefore he was afa mutable Nature, and equally receptive of Vice and Virtue‚ and
other Things oftbe like kind. If these were the Things taught, and publickly
avowed by Alexander and Arias, as each represents the other’s Principles, Ι
perswade my seli, that every sober Man will think they both deserved Censure,
for thus leaving the plain Account of Scripture, introducing Terms of their
own Invention 11110 a Doc'trine of pure Revelation, and at last censuring and
writing one against another, and dividing the whole Church of Christ uponrac-
count oft'nem.

But 'tis no uncommon Thing for warm Disputants to mistake and 1111116016-
sent each other 3 and that this was the Case in the present Controversy, is, I
think, evident beyond Dispute ς Alexander and Arius describing each other's
Opinions, not as they held 1116111 themselves, but according to the Consequen-
ces each imagined to follow from 1116111. Thus Alexander affirms in t-he afore-
mentioned Letter, that the Father ever was, and thence infers what he thinks
neceffarily follows, that the Son, upon whose account 116 is called a Father,
must bave ever been, and yet expressy afferts the Son to he begonem, andthat
1116 Father alone is unbegotten. When Arius represents these Things to his
friend Eztt'ebiass ’tis according to what he accounted the neceffary Consequences
of thern, and not as they were really maintained by Alexander3 and because
