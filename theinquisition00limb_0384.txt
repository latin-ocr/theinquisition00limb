City or Place is governed, under whatfhever Name, shall be compelled by Ecclifiasti-

aliis '¹52‘ prosperousty‘in our Times, to the Glory of God, and the Encrease of the Faith, we
haersst. approve and order to be objerved certain Laws publifhed by F rederick, formerly Em-
1ib.6. peror of the Romans, then remaining in his Devotion to the Church of Rome² ας
far as they promote the Honourof God, and his holy Church‚ We therefore require
and admonifh all st’cular Magistrates and temporat Lords, and the Governors of Pro-
vinces‚ Lands, Cities, and other Places, by whatsoever Dignities, Offices or Names
they may be distinguished, that as they defire to be esteemed and held as faithful, they
obey the Dlocesan Bishops, and Inquifitors of heretical Pravity, deputed, or hereafter
to be deputed hy the Apostolick See, in all ‘Things relating to the Defence of the Faith3
anclthatwhen required by them, they endeavour to seize‚ and keep in safe Custody
Hereticks, 'their Believers, Favomers, Receivers, and Defenders ·, and that without
Delay they carry or order to be carried the aforesaid Persons into the Power or Jnil
cf the Bishops, or the said Inquisttors‚ or to any other Place which they or any of them
shall command within the Powercff the find Lords, or the Distrit‘t of such Rulers,
,where they shall be kept in close and fizfe Custody by Catholick Perfhns‚ deputed by the
aforesaid Bishops, or Inquisitors‚ or any one of them, till their Affair is determined
by the Judgment of the Church. The Law of the Emperor Frederick here refer·-
red to, begins, Commzffi vobis ·, the third Sestion of which is this : Farthermore,
whatfhever Hereticks shall be found in Cities, Toww, or other Places of the Em-
pire, by the I nquifitors deputed hythe Apostolick See, and other Orthodox Persons, zea-
lons for the Faith, let such as have Authority there, be obliged to apprehend them- at
the Notice of the Inquifitors, and other Catholick Persons, and when apprehended,
to keep them in strici Custody, till being condemned by Ecckfiastical Censure, they pe· ,
rish by an accurftd Death, who have condemned the Sacraments of Faith and Life.
Thus also Innocent IV. by a Rescript, beginning, Ad extirpanda, commands,
-Let every Magistrate or Ruler, cause the send Hereticks‚ when taken, to be carried,
at the Expence of the Place where he prestdes, whercfitever the Diocesan or his Vicars
fhall order, within the Jurisdiflion or Distritr of sach Diocescm’ Bishoffi city, or
Place. And that these Words relate to the Inquisitors also, the Beginning and
whole Substance of that Rescript ssiews, which Clement IV, bath a1s0 declared
by another Rescript, beginning, Ad extirpanda.
