The Hts‘ronv of the INQutst-rton.

But the true and genuine Reason is, that the Prisoner may have nothing to
contemplate besides his present Misfortune‚ that so being broken& with the
Miseries of his Confinement, he may confess whatsoever the Inquisttors would
have him. For this Reason they deny them Books, and all other Things
that would be any Relief to them in their tedious Imprisonment. If any one
ofthe Prisoners whatsoever prays the Inquisitor when he visits him, that he*
may have some good Book, or the Holy Bible‚ he is answered‚ that the
true Book is to discover the Truth‚ and to exonerate his Conscience before
that holy Tribunal ·, and that this is the Book which he must diligently stu-
dy, viz. to recover the Remembrance of every Thing faithfully, and de-
clare it to their LordshipS, who will immediately prescribe a Remedy to
his languishing Soul. If the Prisoner in the same or next Visit is importunate
about it, he will be commanded Silence, because if he asks to please himself,
they may grant or deny him according to their Pleasure.

The keeping the Jayl antiently belonged to the Executors Office, and as

often as he was absent, he was obliged to provide another Keeper at his own

Charge. But now the Jayl-Keeper is created by the Inquifitor Genera]² and
is different fron] the Executor.

Those who keep the Jayls for the Crime ofHeresy‚ must swear before the
Bishop and Inqnsitor, that they will faithfully keep their PrisonerS, and ob-
serve all other Things prescribed thern by Clement. Ι. de haeret. §. Porro.

There must be two Keepers to every Jayl, industrious and faithful Men,
one appointed by the Bishop, the other by the Inquifitor. Each of them may
have tneir proper Servant. Belides thiS, to every Cell there must be two dif-
ferent Keys, each Keeper to have one, which they may give to their Ser·
vants, to supply the Prisoners with Necessaries. The Bishop and Inquifitor
baveno Power to agree that there shall be but one Keeper, because it doth
not seem safe enough, neither is it allowed them by Law, nor appointed in
their Cause or Favour. Clem. 1. §.Sana de haeret.

But now there is only one Jayl-Keeper appointed in every Province‚ chosen
by the Inquifitor General, who is not allowed to give the Prisoners their Food.
But the Inquisitors chuse some proper Person to this Office, who is common-
ly called the Dispenser. The Provifions they give the Criminals are gene-
rally prepared and dressed in the House of the Inquifition3 because if they
were to be prepared in the Houses of the Criminals themselves, or any where
else, something might eas1ly be hid under them, that might furnish them with

. the Means to conceal the Truth, or to elude or escape Judgrnent. This how-

ever is to be left to the Prudence and Pleasure of the Inquisitors, whether and
when the Criminals may without Danger prepare their Provision in their
own Houses. But upon account os the Hazard attending it, the Inquisitors
but seidoni, and not without exquifite Care, gratify them ln this Particular.
If any Things are sent them by their Friends or Relations, or Domesticks,
the Jayl-Keeper and Dispenser never suffer thern to have it, without first con-
sulting the Inquisitors. fasti-5107. ‘Talem c. 26.
