to and perseveres in that Depofition. If he doth‚ ’tis written in the aas, how
thatin the Presence of such Persons the Deposition was read to him, and he
stood to it, and persevered in it. And this Eymerick thinks is sufficient. But
as Pegna tells υς, Comment. 1 12. the Proceffes are now carried on in the holy
Tribunal generally without the Presence or Intervention of these Persons,
and the supream Senate of the Roman and general Inquisition allows the Pro-
ceffes thus formed. And indeed these two Persons are of no Use. The Pre-
tence for their being present is, that there may be no Suspicion offoul Play,
when the Things transaffited are seen by so many Eyes, and open to so many
Senses·‚ and that they may know the Witneffes in the Stead of the absent
Criminal‚ as Simancas declares, tit. 64. §. 8. &³ 21. But how doth it make any
thing to the Defence of the Criininal, that his Accusers are known to Persons
that he himself knows nothing of, and who are forbidden to discover any
Thin to him ?

Tffi: Witnesses rnust be examined by the Inquisitors themselves, nor must simanc:
their Examination be committed by any Means to any one else, unless the ‘²² ⁶3·
⁷ Witneffes are justly hindred, and the Judges cannot easily go to them, οῖς· ¹¹·
ought not. In this Case the Inquifitors may commit the Examination of the
Witneffes to the Bishop’s Vicar, or other Ecclefiastical Judge, or to some
skilful and prudent Man, who, with a Notary or Secretary to write down
the Depofitions in the Cause, must diligently examine the Witneffes, and
send the Manner and Constancy, and other Circumstances of the Witneffes
and their Depofitions to the Inquifitors. 1 Instrutt. Hispal. cap. 17. and
