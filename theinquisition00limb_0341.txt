α known to all, or at least not to him who pronounced the erroncous Propo-
“ sirion. But as to this Propofition the DoCtors greatly differ.
“ Or it sounds ill, and offends pious Ears, viz. such as gives Scandal and '9‘- χορ».
‘· Occasion of Ruin to pious Hearers or Readers. When any are offended
“ at such Proposition5‚ the Affertor of them is forced by the Inquisitors pub-
“ lickly to declare their true Sense‚ that so the Scandal given may cease. But
‘⁶ ifsuch a Person be otherwise suspected, he is to be called and interrogated
“ by the Judges 3 and if he gives a probable Sense of the W'ordg he is not
‘⁵ to be compelled to a publick Explanation, provided no one hath been scan-
“ dalized. He is however to be admonished not to speak such Things
“ again for the future.
“ Or it is rash, viz. when attested without any grave Authority or justs· 1²·
“ Reason, insolently and boldly‚ contrary to Ecclefiastical Modesty. As if
‘⁵ any one should say, ‘Ibe Day of Judgment will be wilhin a Month. Some-
“ times however such Propofitions are not accounted rash, when they
‘⁵ are modestly asserted, or have some Probability‚ or pious Tendency to
“ edify the Hearers or Readers. Of this sort are many Things‚ which
“ Men, given to Meditation, may probably imagine to have been donee
“ Or it is scandalons, in which the Scandal may be observed‚ though other· §— 13»
‘⁵ wise not heretical. As if any one should reckon up the Inconveniences of
u holy Confeffi0n‚ or tell the Abuses of the Church of Rome before the com-
“ mon People3 or if any one should say, ‘That an evil Prelate is truly a Thnf
“ anda Robber3 The Universtties and Colleges are introduced by human Vanity ;
‘¹ Pulse and Fifh blow up the Belly, and incline Men to Venery.
“ Or it is schismatical, when tending to introduce Divifion into the Church. §⁷ 14, ἃς·
“ Or seditious,when it becomes the Cause or Occasion ofSedition in the Church.
“ Or blasphemous, when injurious to God and his SaintS. Or favouring Here-

‘⁸ for Instance, Hereticks are not to be pum'shed. Orit is injuriou3‚ when it de-
“ ῑῑαξὶε from, or is injurious to the State of any one of the Faithful, some il-
a lustrious Person or Dignity. Such are those Things which mad and impiousu
“ Men blab out against the Cardinals and Monks.
“ The same Propofition may also have several Qualities. It may be er· ς, 12,
“ roneous‚ and heretical, and schismatical‚ and seditious, rasti, and injurious²

“ Although doubtful Qestions concerning the Faith, are to be determined9‘ ιο,
“ by the chief Pontiff or a general Council, yet as a dostrinal Mamer, 'tis
“ usual for learned and prudent Men to explain and determine what Proposi-

“ Divines. However sometimes the Layers can eafily determine such Mat-
“ ters from the Decrees of the PopeS, Councils and hoiy Fathers.
“ And whereas many who. can’t deny that they uttered such P1·opolitions‚
“ yet will so endeavour to interpret them, as to prevent their being crimiml,
“ therefore there must be careful Observation made as to the Nature of such

‘⁴‘ InterpretationS. Ifthey are just and probable, and do wholly, or ‘sor thse
