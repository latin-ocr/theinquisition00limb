holy Vow of a Monastick Life, are to be revoked and confiscate. Zanchinus
gives this Reason, Cap. 27. Because his Goods are confiscate from the very
Day of his committing the Crime, and therefore he can have no right ofAd-
ministration. But as for the Goods of such, who can’t purge themselves, or are
condemned for Contumacy, they are not forfeited but from the Day they are
presumed to be Hereticks, not from the Day that the Witneffes declare ‘them
to have been Hereticks.

If any one gives a Legacy upon account of Death, and falls into Heresy,
and his Goods become confiscate, the Legacy shall be recovered as void, and
belongs to the Treasury equally with all the other Goods of the Heretick.
Ifan Husband bequeaths any Thing to his Wife, and his Memory be con-
demned for Heresy after his Death, such Donation shall be revoked, altho'
his Legacies to others shall stand good. If any Thing be owing to an
Heretick by aconditional Commet, it belongs to the Treasury under that
Condition, who must perform it, is they conveniently can. All the Goods of
a Wife condemned for Heresy and Impiety are forfeited‚ whether they be
her Dowry‚ or any other Things belides, which she brought to her Husband,
or such Donations as the Spaniards call Arrhoe Ἐ ·, or such Profits as belong
to VVives by the Royal Laws. But the Husband hath all his Actions good
against the Treasury. In like manner the Goods of an heretical Son gotten in

nc , War are confiscated‚ because that is the Son’s private Property, in which the

Father hath no Right. If he shall happen to have sold any ofhis Goods, and
the Money be in his Poffeffion‚ or any Thing equivalent‚ let it be restored
to the orthodox Buyer, but if it be consumed‚ it shall not be restored.
Hence it is, that in every Sentence, the Time of the Person’s falling into
Heresy is particularly expressed, and these or the like Words inserted in it,

;;‚41‚Andby this our Sentence ‘we declara, That all and singular his Goods were brought

into our ‘Treasury from the said Time of committing the Crime, and we do fhlemnly de-
clare all ancl every osthem to be confiscated to the Treasury of the Church of Rome,

and our Office of the Inquzfition.
A Person however must be declared an Heretick by the Judge, before his

l.4. c.12. Goods are actually confiscate. For as Brunus says, “ The Law hath taken

5· 3-

“ Care, that if any one falls into an Heresy already condemned, he shall nei-
“ ther be accounted or punished as an Heretick, unless the Judge shall have
‘⁶ pronounced by his Sentence‚ that he is under the principal Condemnation.
“ So that the Hereticks do, ipfhjure, lose all Property in their EstateS, yet
“ they can't be confiscated till after the declaratory Sentence is pronounced.
“ But however, this must be understood of such a Crime as hath not been
“ certified to the Judge‚ either by Confestim, or legal Proof, or the Evidence
“ of the Thing it self. For in notorious Crimes, which need no Declaration,
“ there seems no need of a declaratory Sentence, according to Dominick;
“ who thought it sufficient, that if an Heretick did not appear to purge him-

“ sels, by the Time fixed by the Judge, nor produce his Vindication, an

ἒ arrha, are the Bresents given to any Women upon their being betrothed. α E θ
