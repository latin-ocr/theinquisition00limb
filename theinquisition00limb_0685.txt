as that there is too much Reason to sear that they wilt be impenitent, or escape, or

relapje, or corrupt and disturb others. Such Persons arcto be sent without further

Delay to a secure and perpetual Jayl. In our Times this antient Confinement oc ’
perpetual Imprisonment, is seldom or never used ς but the Biffiops and Inqui-

fitors often change it for a Confinement in some Monastery.

But altho’ in our Ages the perpetual Jayl is not made after the same Man-Direff.·'
ner in which it was formerly built, yet Pegna is of Opinion, that some cer-P· ΞΛΜ»
tai‘n House ought to be procured‚ and made use of as a perpetual Jayl, in ¹08·
which those who are to be shut up should dwell·, because otherW1se he cm’t
understand how Penitents can perform the Penances enjoined thern. The Ot-
der to be observed in these Things is provided for: by the Ma‘drid Instrutstion,
An. 1561. c, 79, 8&⁴ T hose who are condemned to perpetual Jayl, shcill be configned
to the Keeper of such perpetual Jayl‚ who must be injoined to keep the Criminals, and
to take Care that they fulfill the Penances injoin'd them, and to inform the Inquisttors
{f they are negligent. Likewise let him take Care to affist them in their Neceffities,
by procuring for them the proper Implements according to every one’j‘particular Bu-
finess or Trade, that they may herehy procuresomething for their own Support, and
thus better bear their prefi’nt Msery and Poverty. Atso the Inquisitors are to vJfit
their perpetual Jayl several times in a Y ear, to see how they live, how they are
treated, and what their Condition is. And because in stnne Inquisttions there is no per-
petual Jayl, tho'the Thing be very neceffary‚ they must procure some Houses for this
Purpose ·, because if there be no such Jayl, it can’t he understood how thost² who were
reconciled‚ can fulfil their Penances, or those who are condemned to it be kept in Custody.
Bssut this Case of observing whether they fulfil the Penances injoined them was
formerlycomrnitted to some Priests, by the Co'unci! of Narbonne‚ c. 8. Let
the Care of ohserving their Penances be committed by you to their proper Priesh, so
that the Priests themselves having the Penances of their ftveral Parifhioners committed
to them, and carefully inspectz'ng how they ohserve them, they may‘inform‚ without
Delay, against all Contemners, if any fitch there be to yon, or to those whom you
shall appoint,·<that you may proceed against them according to ‘the Form hereaj‘ter
de crihed.

sThe Manner of this Imprisonment is determined-by the Council of Bia-rra,
c. 23, 24, 225. ‘T ake Care that each of the Persons to bc immor-ed, have, according to
the Appointment of the Apostolick See, separate and private cells, as sar as it ζωα-
