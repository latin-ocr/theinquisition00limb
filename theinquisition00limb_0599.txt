In the supream Court of the general Inquisition at Rome, the Procurator of
the Exchequer gives in the Points and Articles containing the Offences instead
of this Bill of IndiEtment.

But the Promoter of the Exchequer must give in 'Writing the Accusation
to the Judge, in Presence of the Person he accuses, and read himself the Bill
of Accusation, and immediately swear that he bath not put in the Accusa-
tion malicioussy, but to discharge his Office, and because he intends to prove
the Crimes obje&ed. ‘⁶ But 'tis sufficient, as Brzmus says, that any Billl. ⁴3· ἐ.
“ be putin, which, tho' the exa& Form ofLaw is not observed, contains the& ¹¹2 12·
‘⁶ naked Intention of the Petitioner. Yea, a Bill is valid in this Pmcess, al-

“ tho’ it contains no Demand‚ or a triffing one, so that the Intention of the
ξ’ Petitioner is known by the Declaration.'’

Here Gonsalvius observes, that when the Accusation is put in, in VVritingJ· 25·
it ordinarily contains very many pretended Crimes, which the Crimina] never
thought of, and for which no one inform’d against him before the Inquisitors ;
and that for these Reasons. First, That the miserable Wretch may be con-
founded with the Multitude and Heinousness of the Crimes charged on him,
and being almost out of his Wits‚ may not know where he is, where to turn
himself, or what to answer. Secondly, That they may try whether he ad-¹
mits any Thing of the Crimes objeeted to him, or at least by discoursing with
him upon any one of thern, may draw him into a Snare. And that this is
Truth, and not seigned out of Hatred to the Inquifition, plainly appears from
the History of the Inquifition at (ἔθει, the Author ofwhich was a Papist‚ and c. 22.
says, that when the Heads of his Accusation were read to him by the Procu-
rator of the Exchequer, this was one Article‚ amongst others, that he was
accused‚ and sufficiently convieted‚ that he had spoken very irreverently of the
Pope, and against his Authority. To which Accusation he answered‚ that he
did not remember that he had spoken of the Pope in the Manner set forth in
the Accusation 3 but that if they would relate to him the whole Discourse, he
would fincerely and faithfully confess whatsoever he had said. When, after, 23,
this, he was brought before the Inquisltor again, and the Promoter of the Ex-
chequer repeated the same Accusation, they would not open to him the whole
Series and Conneffion of the Discourse‚ nor was this Accusation afterwards
repeated, nor any Mention made of it in his Process, when his Sentence was
publickly read at the A& of Faith. From hence he infers, that this Accu-
sation was false, and only brought against hirn to see if they could fifh any
Thing out of him.

A Copy of the Accusation is usually given to the Crimfflal, to which he Simancr
must answer Article by Article, and his Reply must be immediately written Ψ· 44·
down by the Secretary before the Inquifitors. But if he continues to deny ⁹· ²²·
every Thing, he bath an Advocate allowed him, who generally doth nothing
more, than deny the Matters contained in the Accusation, and affirms that
the Criminal is and always was a Catholick, and that this is plain from his ma-

and unblffinished amongst all Persona {hen they come to a Conclufi0n‚ and
