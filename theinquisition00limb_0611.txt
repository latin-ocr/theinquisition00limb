Ca se. Moreover, let the Inqnisttors inquire from the Peifhn against whom thet· ara
20 proceed, whether he hath any mortal Enemies, or certainlysztſseeffed ,κθ be so ³ salbo,
thro’ Hatred, might fwear against him, and let him put down their Names in Wrzz
ting, whom he says he hath Reasbn legally to filspee‘ZQ and let them proceed and re,
ceive other thnesses against him, and yet nevertheless they may receive sach stiffieaed
PVitneffes if they judge it proper. And 3 little after he adds, And alcho’ the bVitnes-
ses, who are said to hefiespee't’ed, or found 20 be Enemies, are not to he believed, un-
lest there be any Thing that may legally support their Evidence.

The fourth is, that the Person accused, in the End of his Confeffion, be-
fore he is allowed to make his Defence, should be interrogated concerning
those Witnesses who have deposed the most heinous Things against him, as
tho' they were accused themselves, after this Manner. Do you know such a
one, naming one of the most considerable VVitneffes? If he saith he doth not,
he can't reje& him in his Defence as a mortal Enemy, having declared upon
Oath· he did not know him. If he answers, that he doth know him, he is
interrogated, whether he knows, or hath heard that he hath said or done any
Thing against the Faith? Then he is asked, whether he is his Friend or Ene-
my, and presuming that he will answer, His Friend, that his Evidence for
him may be admitted, he can’t after he hath said so, reject him as a mortal
Enemy. Eymerick is for using these two Methods but seldom‚ because, tho?
not at all dangerous to the Deponents, they are prejudicial to the Accused.
But yet he approves that the latter should be used against cavilling and cun-
ning Persons, and says that he himself hath sometimes, tho' seldom‚ taken
this Method against such Persons, whereby, as the Apostle says, being cunning,
he caught them hy Gztile.

Camillus Campegias adds, is· he answers, that 116 doth not know tha-t he hat-h In 222232·
said any Thing against the Faith, the Inquifitor must not omit· to ask him-,⁶³ ³5·
whether he be his Friend or Enemy ἓ» If he answers, his Friend, butthat he
would not be silent even on this Account‚ but would come in Evidence a*
gainst‘ him, if he knew that he had offended against the Faith, he can't objec}
against him any more in this Cause as 3 morta} Enemy. For this is to bere-
marked, that he who once allowsa Witness, can never aster reje& him.

The same Campegias adds another WVay, viz. the Inquifitor asks the accu-
sed Person in his first Examination, what he thinks to be the Reason of¹ his
being apprehended or imprisoned? Likewise‚ who he suspects to be his Accu·
sets? And if he particularly names any, he is asked, why he suspeffits thern
rather than others? To which Qestion perhaps he will· answer, by assigning,
as the Reason or Cause, Hatred, a Law-Suit, or Qarrel, ,or some like Mat-
ter. After this the inquisitor asks him again, whether he hath any otherE-
nemieS, and who they are, and of the Time, and O'ccasion of their Enmity,
as above. He asks him again, who were present, when the Persons he re·
jects as Enemies, affaulted or wounded him, and the like, and by whom hs:
can be informed of the Reality os such mortal Enmity. After this the lnqui-
sitor diligently considers his Answers and Affertions, and receives informatione
