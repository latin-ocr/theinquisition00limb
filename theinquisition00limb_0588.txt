ments, is they omit the leffer ·‚ for if one or another be remitted, they think
they abundantlyrsatissy their Promise.

And by these flattering Assurances they sometimes overcome the Minds of
more unwary Persons‚ and when they have obtained the designed End, im-
mediately forget them all. Of this Gonsalvizcs gives us a remarkable Instance.

, “ In the-first Fire that was blown up at Seville, An. 1558, or 1559,

“ amongst many others who were taken up, there was a certain pious Ma-
“ tron.‚ with her two Virgin Daughters‚ and her Niece by her Sister who
“ was married. As they endured those Tortures of all Kinds, with a truly
“ manlike Constancy, by which they endeavoured to make them perfidi--
“ oussy betray their Brethren in Christ, and especially to accuse one another,
“ the Inquisitor at length commanded one os the Danghters to be sent for to
“ Audience. There he discoursed with her alone for a considerable time, in
“ order to comfort her, as indeed she needed it. When the Discourse was end-
“ ecl, the Girl was remanded to her Prison. Some Days after he acted the
‘⁶ same Part again, causing her to be brought before him several Days to-
“ wards the Evening, detaining her for a considerable while, sometimes tel-
“ ling her how much he was grieved for her Affiifflons, and then intermixing
“ familiarly enough other pleasant and agreeable Things. All this, as
‘⁶ the Event shewed, had only this Tendency, that ast-er he had persuaded
“ the poor simple Girl, that he was really, and with a father-ly Affection
‘⁶ concerned sor her Calamity‚ and would consult as a Father what might be
“ sor her Benefit and Salvation, and that os her Mother and Sisters, she might
“ wholly throw her sels into his Proteffion. After some Days sp ent in such
“ familiar Discourses, during which he pretended to mourn with her over her
*“ Calamity, and to shew himselfaffe&ed with her Miseries, and to give her
‘⁶ all the Proofs of his good will, in order, as far as he could, to remove
“ them, when he knew he had deceived the Girl, he begins to persuade her
“ to discover what she knew of her sels, her Mother‚ Sisters‚ and Aunts‚ who
‘⁶ were not yet apprehended, promising upon Oath‚ that if she would faith-
“ fully discover to him all that fiae knew of that Affair‚ he would find out a
“ Method to relieve her from all her Missortunes, and to send them all back
“ again to their Houses. The Girl, who had no very great Penetration,
“ being thus allured by the Promises and Persuafions of the father of the
“ Faith‚ begins to tell him some Things relating to the holy Dodhine she had
“ been taught, and about which they used to confer with one another. When
“ the Inquisitor had now got hold of the Thread, he dextroussy endeavoured
“ to find his Way throughout the whole Labyrith‚ ostentimes calling the
“ Girl to Audience, that what she had deposed might be taken down in a le·
“ gal Manner, always persuadinor her, this would be the onlyjust Means to
