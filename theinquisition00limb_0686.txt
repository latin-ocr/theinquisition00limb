256 The Hrs‘rowt ofthe INQu1s11-1014.

to provide for them in Neccffaries, according to the Statutes of the Councilof Tho«
louse, which thus determines, c. 10. “ Let the Persons who are immured be pro-
“ videcl for in Neceffaries, according to the Dispofition of the Prelate, by those who
‘⁶ are in Poſjeffion of their Effebts. But zf they have no EffeHs, let them he provi-
“ ded for hy the Prelate.'' But this Punishment or Penance of perpetual [inprison-

ment, shall never, from the Beginning of it, be remitted to any of the aforesaid Cri-
minals, or committed for another, unless it would either restore Hereticks‚ or unless be-

cause of his Absence his Children or Parents would he in imminent Danger of Death‚ or
sor any other cause, which appears very just and reafhnahle‚ Let also the er have
free Access to her immured Hufhand, and the Hushand to his er, that they may
not he denied to cohabit with. each other, whether both be immured‚ or only one.
This Punishment of Immuration ris very difficultly dispensed with, as the
Council of Biterre hath dec-seed, c, 24. and the Council of Narbonne, more
clearly, rc.⁴ 19. As to Persons to he imprifimed‚ we have thought proper to add this ·,
that no one shall he excused from the Jayl, neither the Hushand for his VVife‚ though
she be younger, nor the VVife for the Hufhand, nor any one for his Children or Parent5‚
or other Kindred‚ or for Weakneſs or Age, or any other the like Cause, without the
special Leave of the Apostolick See. However, the Inquifitors with the Ordina-
ries have now a Power of dispenfing, excepting only that it is denied to the
cem. m8.1nquifitors in Spain, by the private Sanftions ot that Inquifition3 so that the
Inquifitor General only dispenses in this Case‚ even as he doth also with re·
spe& to the Habit marked with Croffes. After how long a Time this Dispen-
sation may be allowed, is left to the Pleasure of the Inquifitors, wh0, upon
confidering the Humility and Repentance of the Penitents, may remit this
Punishment within a leffer while, or commute it for another. But 'tis gene-
rally remitted at the Expiration of three Years. But if this Punishment of
the Jayl is injoined never to be remitted‚ 'tis generally dispensed with at the
›Endsof eight Years. But the whole of this depends on the Inquifitors
Plea ure.

However, this Remisfion must be granted with the Advice of the Dio-
cesam, as is ordered, lib. 6. decret. de haeret. As to those who humbly obey your
Commands, and are shut up in Prisbn, or in Jayl, upon the Account of Herzesy, we
give you full Power, as you shall see fit, of nzitigating or changing their Pumfhment,
in concert with the 'Bishops, to whose Jurisdiclion they are subjeor.

These Remiffions may also be obtained with Money, by which Persons may
redeem themselves from Jayl, and the Habits of their Guil›t; and this Me-

Gonsalv. thod of Redemption used to be very common in Spains because, as the
p.166- “ King granted certain Redemptions of these Sambenito’s to the Court young
“ Ladies and Gentlemen, he who received the Grant‚ diligently enquires
“ where, and who the Persons are that are subje& to this Punishment, and
“ who are most inclined and able to redeem it, with whom he afterwards
“ agrees about the Price‚ as he best can, either for more or less, taking into
“ the Account the Person that buys it off, and the Sambenito it self. Such as
“ are irremiffible, the Price -is dearer; such as are ordered to ,perpetual
ff Jmprisonment, ’tis cheaper. ‚Such which are but for a Time.. and de-
