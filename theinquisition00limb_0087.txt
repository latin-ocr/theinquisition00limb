their’great Learning and exemplary Piety. I am sure Ihave no Inclination
to detra& from their Worth and Merit. One would indeed have imagined, that
the Cruelties exercised by the Papists, upon all who opposed their Supersti-
tions in Worship, and their Corruptions in Dostrine, should have given the
first Reformers an utter Abhorrence of all Methods os Persecution for Con·
science sake, and have kept them from ever entering into any such Measures
themselves. But it must be confeffed, that however they differed from the
Church of Rome, as to DoCtrines and Discipline, yet, that they too gene-
rally agreed with her, in the Methods to support, what they themselves ap-
prehended to be Truth and Orthodoxy 3 and were angry with the Papists‚
not sor persecuting, but for persecuting themselves and their Followers ·‚ be·-
ing really ofop'mion that Hereticks might be persecuted, and, in some Cases,
persecuted to Death. And that this was their avowed Principle, they gave
abundant Demonstration by their PraCtice.

was, as his Followers allow, naturally of a warm and violent Temper·, but was
however inhis Judgment against punilhing Hereticks with Death. Thus, in his
Account of the State of the Popish Church, as related by Sekendorf, he says :
vhe true Church* teoches the Word of God, but forces no one to it. If any 0ne1.2.S<6t.
will not believe it, she [lifiniffes him, and fhparates her sels from him, according 36. ΜΞ·
to the command of Christ, and the Example of Paul in the ACts‚ and leaves him
to the Judgment of God .· Whereas our Execulioners, ond most eruel Tyrants, teach
not the Word of God, hut their own Articler, abling as they slease, and then ad-
judge those who refuse to believe their Areia-les, and ohey their Decrees, to the Fires.

The same· Author gives us many- other strong Paffages to the same Purpose.
Particularly, in one ofhis Letters to Lincus, who ass<ed his Opinion about the
Puniffiment of false Teachers, Luther says : I am very averse to the shedding of [bis-Stet.
Blood, even in the Cafh of such as dessrve it: And I the more especially dread-it in ¹3· §- 43·
this Case, because, as the Papists and Jews, under this Pretence, have destroy'd
holy Prophets and innocent Men ; s0 I am afraid the stzme would hoppen among st
our selves, ff in one stngle Instance it should be allow'd lawfulfor Seducers to be put
to Death. I can therefore, by no AIeans, allow that false Teachersfhoulcl be destroy’a'.
But as to all' other Punishments, Luther seems to have been of Austin’s M ind,
and thought that they might be lawfully used. For after the before-mention'd
Passage, he adds, 'Tis sufficient that they should be baanhed.· And in anotherlbid. Stet.
Place, he allows, That Heneticks may be correeled, and forced, at least, to filence, 36· §- 83.
if they publickly deny any one of the Articles received by all Christians, and por-
ticularly that Christ is Coei-3 affirmt'nghim to be a mere Mon or Prophet. This,
says he, is not to force Men to the Faith, but to restrat'n puhlick Blasphemv. In ano-
ther Place he goes farther, and says, That Hereticks are not, inelctnl, to he put l. 3· gest,
to Death, but may however be confined‚ and shut up in some certain Place, and [ut 8. ς. 28.
