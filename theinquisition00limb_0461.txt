 

The HisToRY ofthe INQUISITION. 3¹

whether such a one is to be accounted an Heretick‚ even tho’ not conviCted
by lawful Witneffes

On the negative Side ’tis urged, that Heresy supposes an Error in the Un- 40·
derstanding, and Obstinacy in the Will in adhereing to those Things which
are contrary to the Deterrnination ofthe Church. Hence they infer that that 64·
of Innocent is reasonable and true, who said, That ifany one believes what the Cap. Fir-
Church believes, but thro' the Influence ofnatural Reason falsely supposes thatmim ‘³³
the Father is either greater than the Son, or before him, or that the threess‘rssqugoe.
Persons are three Things distinet from each other, he is not an HeretiCk, and n. 6¹.
doth not offend, because he believes this is the Churches Belief, and supposes
his own Opinion to be the Faith of the Church. Therefore he thinks 'tis but 66, 67.
reasonable‚that in the Defences of the Cri1ninals,regard ought to be had to their
Simplicity and Imprudence, so that the Punishment may be mitigated, and
that the Judges‚ especially the Inquisitors of heretical Pravity‚ according to
their Office, should be very solicitous and diligent in examining· and searching
into their Destnces, because of the partial and maimed Defence of the Crimi- ς, 69·
nals, tho’ the Party doth not seek it, or even refuse it. But he adds, that ’tis
antiently decided by the Rota 875 in C. Accusatus de hercfi, in tit. de hceret. that
if any one be accused ofHeresy, and legally convicted by Witneffes or other-
wise, and yet denies that he said or believed such heretical Things‚ yet that he
ought nevertheless to be condemned as a negative and impenitent Heretick,
and delivered over to the secular Arm, altho’ he afferts that he believes, and
hath believed as the Church believes.
“ However‚ the Dodkors generally maintain the Affirmative, because theQ 276.
Nature of Faers demonstrate the Intention‚ Mind and Will ofthe Doers. For
Instance, Ifany one should do a properly Jewish Action, such as observing<5‚234,
the Sabbath, and other Jewifh Rites‚ from thence is inferred the intention and
Will ofJudasssng. If the Intention doth not appear, in a doubtful Case, 'tis pre-
sumed that this was done with the Intention ofJudczz'smg‚ when the A& or Coni-
miffion is certain, either from the Person's Confestim, or by Witneffes, and espe-
cially isthe Person be suspected. He therefore who confeffes an heretical Aetion,
and denies the Intention‚ which is the Qality affeffiting such an Aetion to make
it punilhable or not, may possibly be condemned as a negative Heretick ·‚ αἱ·
least may be tortured to discover his intention, as the Doctors are generally of
Opinion, and as is the usual Praffice. Brut is the Fa& be plainly heretical,
such as a Person's going over, or returning to the Jewjsh or Pagan Rites‚ 'tis
sufficient to his being condemned as an Heretick, that he be convi&ed ofthe
Fau, altho' there be no certainty as to his Belief. They also make a Dine-pm. z‘.
rence between an heretical Word and Face, and [ἔργω gives the Reason ofthiss· φεῦ
Difference. There is this Difference between one who conseffes an heretical Fact,
and one who confeffes an heretical Wmd, and denies the evil Intention ·‚ that
he who confesses the Fa& is to be delivered over especially if he be a suspected
Person, and the Fa& hath been repeated3 whereas he who confesses an hc-
retical Word, is to 'oe torturcd to discover his Intention. The Reason of the
Difference is, because there is a greater Affection of the Soul‚ and Delibera-
tion ofthe Mind. in Ρειὲὶε than in Words, To this they add, that there l:ire ξ, 3ηὲ
