cised great severity towards all who would not profess the Arian Faith, being
excited hereto by Cyrill one of his Bilhops, who was perpetually suggesting to
him, that the Peace and Sasety of his Kingdorn could not be maintained, un-
less he extirpated all who differed from him as publick Nusances. This cruel
ecclefiastical Advice was agreeable to the King's Temper, who immediately

Arians‚ and other HeretickS‚ against the Orthodox themselves, it being, as
Hunnerz'ck observes in his Editt, an Instance of Virtue in a King‚ to turn evil
Counsels against those who were the Authors of them. But though the Persecution
carried on by the Orthoclox was no Vindication of Hztnnerick’s Cruelty towards
them, yetI think they ought to have observed the Justice of divine Provi-
dence, in suffering a wicked Prince to turn all those unrighteous Laws upon
themselves, which, when they had Power on their fide, they had procured for
the Punishment and Destruetion ofothers. A particular Account of the Cruel-

ties exercised by this Prince may be read at large in Vmor de Vandal Perfhc.

3Zeno, though perfeffly Orthodox in his Principles‚ yet was a very wicked
and profligate Prince, and rendered himself so extremely hateful to his own
Family‚ by his Vices and Debaucheries‚ that Bafilz'scus, Brother of Verina,
Mother of Zeno's Empress‚ expelled him the Empire, and reigned in his stead ς
and having found by Experience‚ that the Decrees of the Council of Chalcedon Evag, 1, 3.
had occafioned many Disturbances‚ he by an Edi& ordained‚ that the Nicenec-4-
Creed alone should be used in all Churches, as being the only Rule of the pure
Faith, and sufficient to remove every Heresy, and perfectly to unite all the
Churches 3 confirming at the same Time the Decrees of the Councils of Con-
stantinople and Ephesus. But as to those of the Council of Chalcedon he ordered,
that as they had destroyed the Unity and good Order of the Churches, and the
Peace of the whole World‚ they should be anathematized by all the Bishops;
and that where-ever any Copies of those Articles should be found they should
be immediately burnt. And that whosoever after this should attempt, either .
by Dispute or Wrsting, or Teaching, at any Time, Manner or Place‚ to utter‚
or so much as name the Novelties that had been agreed on at Chalcedon contrary
to the Faith, should, as the Authors ofTumults and Seditions in the Churches
of God, and as Enemies to God and himself, be subjest to all the Penalties of
the Laws, and be deposed, if Bishops or Clergymen 3 and if Monks or
Laicks‚ be punished with Banilhment‚ and Confiscation of their Effice, and
even with Death it sels. Most of the eastern Rilhops subscribed these Lettersl· 3· c. 5·
of Bafilzfiu53 and being afterwards met in Council at Ephefizs, they deposed
Acacius the orthodox Bilhop os Constantinople‚ and many other Bilhops that
agreed with him. They also wrote to the Emperor to inform him, That they
had voluntarily subscrihed his Letters 3 and to persuade him to adhere to them, or
that otherwise the whole World would befitbverted‚ if the Decrees of the Synod of
Chalcedon fhould be re-establishcd‚ which had already produced innumeroble Slaugh-
ters, and occafioned the shedding of the Blood of the orthodox Christiano, But κιίὲῗὸξας,
