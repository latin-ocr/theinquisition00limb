The HrsToRY ofthe INQUISITION. 245

- The Inquifitors must take Care not to talk with the Criminals‚ when they
are examined or vifited, upon any other Affairs but such as relate to their
Business. Nor must the Inquisitor be alone when he visits, or otherwise gives
them Audience; but must have with him his Collegue, or at least a Notary, or
some other faithful Servant of the Holy Office. According to the Madrz'd
Instruction, An. 1561. cap. 17.

This also they are particularly careful of, that the Criminals may not be
removed from one Cell to an0ther, nor associate with any other. If any Pri-
soners have been shut up together at once in the same Cell, when they are re-
moved, they must be removed together, that hereby they may be prevented -
from communicating any Thing that hath been transacted in the Prison.
This is more especially to be observed, in case any of them recall their Con-
feffion, after they have been removed from one Cell and Company to another.
But ifa Criminal confeffes‚ and is truly converted, he may more eafily be re-
moved from one Cell to another, because the Inquifitor is in no Pain for sear
of his retracting, but may oftentimes make use of him to draw out the Truth
from other Prisoners, according to the Advice of Eymerick, in his Direcfftory
of the Inquifition, p. 3. n. 107. and Pegna's Commentary 23. Yhings ofthis
Nature, says he, are to be learned rather from Experience than Art, or Precept,
especially as there are some Things which must neither be revealed or taught, and are
well known in themselves to the Inquifitors.

If VVomen are imprisoned‚ they must each of them have, according tochna,
their Qality, one honest Woman at least for a Companion, who must never Prax. [aq.
be absent from her, to prevent all Suspicion of Evil. This Companion mustl· ²· ⁶· 13·
be antient‚ ofa good Life, pious and faithful. Sometimes when Women aren· ⁶·
to be imprisoned, they do not carry them to the Jayl of the Inquisitors‚ espe-
cially ifthey are Regulars, if the Jayls be within the Walls of the Monaste-
ries, but to the Convents of the Nuns. When this happens, they command
the Abbess or Prioress to admit no Body to discourse with the Prisoner with—
out express Leave of the Inquisitor, but diligently to observe the Order gi-
ven her. But when the Cause is of Importance‚ and full of Danger, and such
they esteem al] that relate to the Faith, they think it safer that women should
beimprisoned in the Jayls of the InquifitorS. But the Cardinals Inquisitors
General are tov be consulted in this Affair, who, after mature Conlideration,
are to determine whether it be most expedient that suchCriminals should be
kept iu the Jayls of the Bissaops, or Inquisitors Regulars, especially if they
are young and handsome‚ as is often the Case of those who are taken up fot·
telling Peoples Fortunes about their SweetheartS.

’Tis further the Custom and received Use of this holy Tribunal, that such
who are imprisoned for Heresy‚ are not admitted to hear Mass, and other
Prayers which are said within the Jayl, till their Cause is determined. Their
principa] Pretence for this Custom is, thatit may poflibly happen, when there
is a great Number of Criminals, that the several Acconiplices‚ compinions*
and l²artal<ers of the Crime, may at least by Nods and Signs ‹litt-over to ono

another, how they may escape Judgment, or conceal the Truth. B
