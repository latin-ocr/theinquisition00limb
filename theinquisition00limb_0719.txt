reticks‚ pronounced when the secular Judge is absent, is valid‚ provided
there be all other Things effential to it. For t'ne Laws do not so require the
Presence of the secular Judge or his Officers, as tho’ nothing profitable could
be transacted without him, but only that they, as Servants, should put in
Execution the Sentence pronounced3 for every other Ast is forbidden them in
this Crime‚ which is merely Ecclefiastical. Cap. ut lnqmsstionis, ᾗ. Prohi-
bemus, de haeret. l. 6. And if the Presence of the secular Judge was necessa-
ry in pronouncing Sentence of Condemnation against impenitent or relapsed
HeretickS, he might easily by this Means hinder the Office of the Inquisition,
by denying his Presence, either for no Reason, or for a reigned and pretended
one. So that when the Inquifitor and Bishop have pronounced Sentence upon
the Criminal, it shall be valid, tho’ the secular Magistrate cannot or will not be
present·‚ and it shall be sufficient to intimate to him by some legal Person in
Writing when there is Need‚ and which is the safest Method, that such a Person
isjudged to be an obstinate Heretick, and impenitent or relapsed ·, and the se-
cular Magistrate, tho’ not present at the Sentence, shall be obliged to give
Credit to such an Intimation, a-nd to put to Death the Heretick delivered
over to him, unless he will be most grievoussy punilhed as a Favouret ofHe·
reticks, and Hinderer of the holy Office. Nor must he have any Copy of the
Process.

Also in the same'Chapter Novimus, ’tis¹ commanded, that the Church shall
effectually' intercede for him, who is to be delivered over to be punilhed by
the secular Court, ‘that the Sentence concerning him may be so moderated‚ as
to prevent Danger ofDeath ³¹⁶. And altho’ the Emperor Frederick provided by
his Law, Let no one presume to intercede with us in Behalf offizch‚ which if anyPegna‚
doth, he shall deservedly incur our Indignation 3 yet the Ecclefiastical Judges may com. 20·
intercede in another Court for such a one; and altho’ such Interceffion is for-i”,P“⁷²· ζ·
bidden, which tends to favour the Heretick, or to the Hindrance of Justice 3¹³²“3'
· yet such Intercesfion is not, which tends to the avoiding Irregularity‚ and
which Is particularly injoined by the Law it self. However, every Difficulty

²* “ Is there, says Dr. Geddes, in his View of the Court of Inquifition in portugal, p. 446. in
‘⁶ 311 History, an Instanee of so gross and confident a Mockery of God, and the Worid, as this of
‘⁶ the lnqtiilitors beseeching the civil MagistrateS, not to put the Hereticks they have condemned
“ and delivered to them, to Death? For were they in Earnest when they made this ‘solemn Pe-
Ξ( tition to the secular Magillrates‚ why do they bring their Prisoners out of the Inquilition, and
“ deliver thern to those Magistrum, in coats painted over with Phimes? Why do they teaeh
“ that Hereticks, above all other Malefa&ors‚ ought to be punistied with Death3 And why do
‘⁶ they never resent the secular Magistrates having so little Regard to their earnest and joint Pe-
“ titi0n‚ as never to fail to burn all the Hereticks that are delivered to them by the Inquisition,
“ within an Hour or two after they have them in their Hands? And why in Rome, where tho
‘⁴ supream, Civil, and Ecclefiastical Authority ate lodged in the same Person, is this Petition of
“ the Inquiffiion, which is made there as well asin other Places, never granted ἔ Thus far Dr.
ceddes. And let me here add, that this Hypocrisy and Diffimulation is the more vile and execrablc,
in that the inquisitore, are commanded by the Bulls of several PopeS, to compel the secular Magi-
strate, under Penalty of Excornmunication and other Ecclefiassical Censures, within six Days rea—
dily to execute the Sentences pronounced by the Inquilitors against Hereticks, i. e. to burn them.
The under Mercies os these Wretches are Cruelty.
