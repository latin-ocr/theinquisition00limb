24 The HISTORY ofthe INQUISITION.

rcfy hath not only learnt to deny Christ, but also to delight in Slaughters. But even
this was not sufficient tosate'sfy them. For as the Father of their Heresy goes about as
a roam-ng Lim, fteking whom to devour 3 so these having Liberty to go up and down,
run ahout, and whomsoever they happen to meet with, who either blame their Ftight,
or ahhor their Heresy‚ inhumanly tare them with Scourges‚ or hind them with
¹„ 830. Chains, or hanish them from their native Country. And a little after : If it he a
mean and dishonesl Thin-g, that some Bishops have chang’d their Opinion through
Fear‚ how much more heinous and vile is their VVickedness, who, as is the Case gene-
rally of those who mistrust the Goodness of their Cause, have forced others against
their 'Wilt to renounce their Belief ? ΕΤ hus also the Devil‚ because he hath no Truth
in him, invades Men with the Hatchet and Ax ·, and thus violently breaks open the
Doors of those that receive him. The Saviour‚ on the contrary, is gentle ·, his Lan-
guage is, Ifany one will, let him follow me, and become my Disciple. When
he comes to any one, he doth not make use of Ferae, hut knocks at the Βοῶν, and says, “
Open to me, my Sister, my Spouse. If they open he enters 3 if they refuses it he
departs .· For ‘Truth is not to be preach'd hy Sca-orcis, or Dans, or military Wea-
pons 3 hut by Perswaston and Advice, But what room is there for the Liberty of
Perswafion‚ where Men are awed hy the imperial Authority ἓ And whatstgnifies
Reasoning‚ when whoever oppofi’s is fitre to he rewarded with Banishment or
Death? And after a great deal more, he thus inveighs against the bloody
P· 852· Arians: All their Endeavours ahound with Slaughter and Impiety 3 and fiich is the
,accursed Crastiness of their Temper and Behaviour‚ that they abus} and deceive
Men hy the Promises ofHonours‚ and Massstracies, and Money‚ that so when they
cannot obtain the Constitution of their Bifhoprick by lawful Meam, they may give
the more fimple some Appearance of a right Institution. So that the very Name
of Heathen is too good for them 3 so far are they from meriting the Name of
Christians, and their Attions fi) unlike those of Men, that they are peifettly savage
and brutal. For such is their Cruelty and Barbarity, that they are more bloody than
the very Executioners, and more vile than any other Hereticks‚ and greatly excelled‚
even hy the Heathens themselves .· For I have heard from the Fathers‚ and I believe
it true, that in the Persecution under Maximianus, the Granasather of Constan-
tim, the Heathens conceal'd our Christian Brethren when they were fought after,
and were themselves oftentimes fin'd and imprison'dfor no other Rea-fon, but because
they would not hetray those that fled to them, thinking themselves hound to protet't‘ them
wilh the same Fidelity as they would have expelled themselve53 not in the least

afraid to expose themselves to Danger on that Account. But now these wonderful ι

Inventors of a new Heresy‚ famous for nothing so inueh as their fresionem, aa quite
the Reverſs’ ·‚ for they seek out those that conceal themstlves‚ and lay Snaresfor thoſs’
that harhour them 3 and become of their own Aecord, very Exeeutioners 3 account-
ing the Concealed and the Concealor equally their Enemy .· So·that they are naturally
Μαθεῖν, and Murtherers‚ and Rivals of the chedness of Judas. ''Tis indeed im-

poffihle that any Words can sufficiently desti-ibe their Attions. What would not this ·

Dofior have said, had he seen the cruel Laws of the Inquifition brought: into
Use, by which 'tis not only a Crime to conceal an Heretick, but all who

„do not inform against him are anathematiz'd as F avourers and DefendIe-Irs of
