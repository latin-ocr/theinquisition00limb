that he might publickly satisfy those by Purgation‚ whom he had publickl‘y

offended by the ungrateful Smell of Infamy‚ and he was therefore purged 111χ
that Place where he was known to be defamed. And if he had been defamed

in several Places, he was obliged publickly to profess in all of thern the Ca-

tholick Ruth, and [0 detest the Heresy for which he was there defamed.

The Form os the Oath, by which defamed Persons were formerly obliged to

purge themselves, was prescribed by the Council of Tarracone. l N.jwear by Al-

niiqf'ny Gon, ond oy these'hcly Goffiels of God, which are now in my Hands, before·
qm} [he Lord N. Areh-Bishop‚ or Bzfhop, and before you who are here prestent, that

[neither ain, norwas one of the Inzabbatati, Valdenses‚ poor Men of Lyons,

nor (m Heretz'ck of any See] of Heresy condemned hy the Church‚ and that I do not,
believe, nor ever have believed their Errors, nor ever will, the whole T ime of my
Life. I'ea, I profess andprotestthczt I do believe, and always will for the future,

lieiieve the Catholici< Fano, which the holy Roman and Apostolick Church publickly

holds, reaches andpreaelaes, and which you my Lord Arch-Bishop or Bishop‚ and the
other Prelates of the universal Church do hold, and publickly preach and teach. Ther
Form of the Oath‚ prescribed to the Compurgators, is this: I N. stamar by
ch, and hy these four holy Gosjoels of God, which I hold in my Hands, that I firm-
ῖγ believe, that such a one harh not been one of the Inzabbatati, Valdenses‚ or poor*
Men cf Lyons, nor an Heretick, nor a Believer of their Errors, and I firmly be-
lieve that in teis Mamer he hathsworn the =T ruth. Having performed the Purga-

tion injoined him, the Criminal must be absolved, and declared to be a Person

of good Reputation‚ nor can he be afterwards proceeded against upon the
preceding Proofs. And thus the Infamy is removed, or the Effe& of ’ the ,[11-Υ
fam of [116 Ραξῒ.

Ifyhe fails in his Purgati0n‚ i. e. ifhe can’t procure such and so> many Pur-
gers as he is injoined, he is esteem'd as a (101111ὶᾶ, and condemned as arr He-
retick.

‘e 111111 ι But others use this Distinffion. If he can't procure so many Witneffes,

inquis. because they don't believe he hath sworn the Truth, in such a Case he is ac-

Pl‘f‘g-Caflwounted as a Convifit, and deficient in his canonica} Purgation. But ifhe--
can’t procure them because he is poor, or a Foreigner, and so doth not-know

so many Persons in the whole Town, in this Case the Judge may relieve him

at 1113 Pleasure, upon confidering the Qality of the Person, Crime, and In-

famy. So thatjf he can't procure so many of the Clergy to be 1113 Com-

purgators‚ they may admit Laicks, or Women for want of Men. And if
for the same Reason they can't procure so many of the Laity, they may be-

lieve his Oath alone. And inasmuch as one who is defeffive in his Purgation,

is accounted as a (20011161, they infer from hence, that if at any other Time 116.
had fallen into Heresy‚ he ought now to be accounted as a Relapse for [116-
Dese& of his Purgation, and, as such, to be delivered over to the secular

Court.

But if he refuses to purge himself 116 13 excommunicated, and if with ann
liardned Mind 116 1163 under this Excommunication for a Year, he is con-
demned as an Heretick. If after 1113, Purgation 116 falls into the Heresy from*
