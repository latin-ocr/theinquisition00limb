exercised on them, enough, one would think, to have overcome the firm·
est· human Resolution and patience, could never extort from them a Con-
fess'ion of that Guilt their Enemies would gladly have fixed on them. And
yet Innocent as they were in all respects, they were treated with the uc·
most [ndignity, and destroy'd by such Inventions of Cruelty, as were abhorrent
to all the Principles of Humanity and Goodness. They were, indeed, accused
ofAtheism, i. e. for not believing in and worssiipping the fiffitious Gods of
Euscb· the I-Icathens. This was the Cry of the Multitude against Polycarp .· This is the
E. H. ¹· 4·D052¹0r0fAs1a, the Father of the Christz‘nm, the Subverter of our Gods, who teaches
‘' 15· many thal they must not perform the fizcrecl Rites‚ nor worship our Deities. “ This
was the Reason of the tumultuous Cry against him, Αιςε τες Aeeta, Away with
these Alheisss. But would not one have imagined that Reason and Philosophy
should have informed the Emperor, that this kind of Atheism was a real Vir-
tue‚ and delerved to be encouraged and propagated amongst Mankind? No ς
Reason and Philosophy here failed him, and his blind Attachment to his
Country Gods caused him to shed much innocent Blood, and to become the

c. 13· seems to have been senfible 01 the great Injustice of this Persecution, and by
an Edi& ordered they should be no longer puniffied for being Christians.

I shall not trouble my Reader with an Account ofthis Persecution as carried
on by Severus, Decius, Gallus, Valerianus, Dioclefian, and others of the Roman
Emperors, but only observe in general, that the most excessive and outragious
Barbarities were made use ofupon all who would not blaspheme Christ, and of-
fer Incense to the imperial Gods: They were publickly whipped3 drawn by the
Heels through the Streets of Cities‚ racked till every Bone of their Bodies was
disjointed ·‚ had their Teeth beat out ; their Noses, Hands and Ears cut off·,
sharp pointed Spears 1311 under their Nails; were tortured with melted
Lead thrown on their naked Bodies ·‚ had their Eyes dug out; their Limbs
cut οἷς were condemned to the Mines·‚ ground between Stones; stone'd to
Denth3 bui-nt alive·‚ thrown Headlong from high Buildings; beheaded;
smothered in burning Lime—Kilns; ran through the Body with lharp Spears ς
destroyed with Hunger, Thirst and Cold·‚ thrown to the wild Beasts3 broiled
on Gridirons with ssow Fires ; cast by Heaps into the Sea·‚ crucified ς scraped
to Death with ssiarp Shells·, torn in Pieces by the Boughs of Trees3 and, in a
Wde, destroy’d by all the various Methods that the most diabolical Subtlety
and Mal ce could devise. ⁷

It must indeed be confeffed, that under the latter Emperors who perseeuted
the Christians, the Simplicity and Purity of the Christian Religion were greatly
corrupted, and that Ambition, Pride and Luxury, had too generally prevail-
