 

The HisToRY ofthe INQUISITION. 109

The Friars Minors met at Peroust’, from all the Provinces of the Christian
'world about the next Whitsontide. There was present iwichael Coese7m5‚ Ge..
neral o’f the Order, and other Provincial Ministers. Being admonished by
some CardinaIS, that they should give their Opinion in this Affair agreeable
to the Sense of the F ather5‚ they replied thus : Adhering firmi>¹ and wholly to the
Determination of the holy Roman Chumh, we stzy and confess with one Heart and
Mind, that to say and affert, that Christ,fhewing the Way ofPetfeasiion, and his Apo-
stles following the same Way of Perfebission, and giving an Example to others who are
scilling to live perfec‘ily‚ had nothing by Right of Property and Domain, no proper
Right, whether special or in common, is not heretical, butsound, catholick, and saith· xxiv. q. ι.
ful .· Especially as the holy Roman Catholick Church, which is proved never to haveareffa,&c÷
deviated or erred from the Path cprqstolick Tradition, says this expressy, affirmsstfudwda
and manifestly determines it. Extra de verb. signif. Exiit. l. 6. m fi·

When this Rescript of the Chapter was seen, by which the Opinion of the
Beguins was approved, the Pope published an Edic‘t concerning the Use os
Things distinet from Property, beginning, Ad conditorem Canonum. But whn
Friar Bonagratia Bergomenfis, made by the Chapter Procurator of the Order,
protested against the Pope, and appealed to a future Pontiff, or Oecumenical
Council, which Appeal was judged to be insolent·, the Pope by a Decree,
beginning, Cum inter nonnullos viros scholasticos, declared it to be heretica} to
affert, that our Saviour and his Apostles had no Right to use or consume the
Things which the sacred Scriptores testify they had, nor any Right to sell
or give thern, or procure other Things by them.

But as Cresenas did not acquiesce in this Sentence of the Pope, but opposed Bzovius,
the Papal Constitutions, being? affisted by the F riars Bonagratia Bergomensts, ‘3- ¹529·
Peter Corbarius, and IVilliczm Orkam, an Englifhman, in the Year 1329. May, &- 5² &02
Cal. 12. he was declared by the Pope to be a Favourer of Hereti‘ckS, an·
open Heretick, an Arch—heretick, and a Schismatick, and degraded from all
Offices, Dignsties, and Honours whatsoever‚ and deprived of the Ecclesiasti«
cal Privilege, and declared incapable of any, and subjected to all the Pu-
nilhments and Sentences, Spiritual and Temporal, to which the F avourers
of Hereticks, Arch—hereticks, and Schismaticks‚ are liable, by Divine or
Ecclefiastical Law. The F riars Minors being gathered together in· a Ge-
neral Chapter at Paris, after they had pronounced Ccesenas entirely degraded‚
and put Gerard Odonis into his Place, published this Sentence of the Pope, and
declared that both he and his Companions had incurred the Penalties of Ex-
communication and Privation, as notorious and manifest Apostates, which by
the Statutes of the Order are well known to be inflic‘ted on those Friars who

withdraw themselves, and apostatize from the Obedience of the Order. This
Sentence of the Order being sent to the Pope, he again pronounced Caefi’rms
guilty of various Crimes and Herefies, and condemned him, December, Cal,
16. of the same Year. Corbmius, terrified with this dre-adfui Sentence,
confeffed his Errors, and after having read his Confeffion and Abjura-
tion of his Errors, and sworn to obey the Apostolick Commands, he Ob·

tained the Benefit of Absolution from all SentenceS, either of the Law οὲ {ssyen}
