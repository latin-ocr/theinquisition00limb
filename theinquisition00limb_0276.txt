“ the Dofirine of the said Friar Peter John contains Errors and Herefies,.

‘⁶ nor obey the Pope if he should command him to recal what he had said

“ on this Head; and that if for this he should excommunicate him, he

‘⁶ fitting upon the Beast, by which he understands and expounds it ro be the
‘⁶ Church of Rome, which he says is Babylon the great Whore and the carnal
“ Church. Item, He says, that the said Roman Church, under the Name of

esteemed heretical, obstinately to affirm, that our Lord Jesus Christ, and hist
Apostles had nothing in special or in common ? After the Qestion was pro--
posed, that all might give their Opinion with greater F reedom‚ he suspended
