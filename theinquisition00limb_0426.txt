such of them however as ore less necffzryfhall be fhld to bring in the said Qantity. T he
Executor of this Affair shall take Care to write down what he orders at the Bot-

tom of the register'd Eff‘effl, and what remains fhall be affigned over to the Dispen-
[αῖον of the Przsoners, in the Presence of the Attorney of the Sequestration. And
the Inquifitors fhall be certified czs to the whole Affair.

In many Inquifitions this exa& Order is not observ'd, either through Po-
verty‚ or for other Reasons·‚ in which Case every one abides by the re-

ceived Custom of his Inquifition.
In Spain there are fixed SalarIes for the Inquifitors, and other Mini-

sters of the holy Office, which are paid them at stated Times out of the
forfeited Effe&s, according to the Qanti-ty and order describ’d by Simancas.
Cathol. Inst. tit. 41. η. 33, 34.
“ The Salaries must be paid to the Inquifitors and Officers by the Com·-
,“ monweakh, which they serve with great Labour‚ but greater Profir.
,ὅ Every Inquifitor hath annually allow’d him 6oooo, which now is increas'd
“ to an hundred thousand Pieces, every one of which is worth two of those
“ Brass Pieces of Money, which they commonly call Albi. The Judges
“ of the forfeited Effe& have each of them 30000. The Promotor Fiscal
“ as many. The Scribe or Notary the same. The Executor 60000. The
“ Receiver as many. The Meffenger 30000. The Door-keeper 10000.
“ The Phyfician 5000. These Salaries may be increas’d at the Pleasure
“ of the Inquifitor General, and are to be paid by the Receiver at the
'⁸‘ fixed Times, wh1ch if he neglee‘cs to do, he may be deprived of his Of-
{f fiee by the Inquifitors. 4Inst.Tolet. c. 2. Inst. 3. Valdolit. c. 13,

'³‘ is to be paid in the Beginning of every fourth Month, and* they then⁴ be-
“ gin to be due, when the Judges and Ministcrs go from their Houses to
