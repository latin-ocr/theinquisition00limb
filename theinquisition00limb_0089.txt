treated castellio, in so rude and crue] a Manner, as I believe his warmest Friends
will be ashamed to justify. In some of his Writings he calls him, Blafphe-
mer, Reviler‚ malicious barking Dog, full of Ignoranoe, Bestiality and Impudense,
Impostor, a bafi³ Corrupter of the Sacred Writings, a Mocker of God, a Contem-
e21022n÷2e22 aaronemea&aaff
A Disciple and Brother of Ser—vetus, and an Heretick. Castellio's Reply to all
these Flowers, is worthy ,the Patience and Moderation of a Christian, and
from his Slanderer he appeals to the righteous Jndgment of God. But not
content with these Investives, Calvin farther accused him of three Crimes
which Castellio particularly answers. The first was of Theft, in taking away
some Wood, that belonged to another Person, to make a Fire to warm him-
self witha] ε This Calvia calls, Curſsed Gain, at another’s Expence and Damage 3
whereas, in Truth, the Fa& was this. Castellio was thrown into such Circum-
stances of Poverty by the Persecutions of Cal-vin and his Friends‚ that he was
scarce able to maintain himself. And as he dwelt near the Banks of the
Rhine, he used, at leisure Hours, to draw out of the River, with an Hook,
the Wood that was brought down by the Waters of it„ This VVood was no

the Decree of the Senate. This the charitable Calvin magnifies into a Theft‚
and publissies to the World to paint out the Charadster os his Christian Bro-
ther.

B'ut his Accusations ran farther yet ·, and he calls God to witness, that whilst
he maintained Castellio in his House, he never saw any one nzoreproud‚ or perfidi-
ous, or void of Humanity 3 and 'twas well known he was an Impostor, of a peculiat-
Impudence‚ and one that took Pleaficre in scoffing at Piety, and that he delighled
himself in laughing at the Principles of Religion. These Charges Castellio an-
swers in such a Manner, as was enough to put even Malice it self to fi-
lence. For, notwithstanding Calvin's Appeal to God for the Truth of these
Things, yet he himself, and two of his principal Friends, who were eminent
Preachers in sowy, pressed Castellio‚ even contrary to his Inclination‚ to take
the Charge of a School in Stratfhurg: And therefore, as he says to Calvia,

With what Conscience could you make me Master, zf you knew meto be fitch a Perfhn‚ .

when I dwelt in your House ? What Sort of Men must they be who would commit the
Education of Children to ficch a wicked Wretch as you appeal to God you knew me to
he ? But what is yet more to the Purpose, is, that after he had been Master of
that School three Years, Calvia gave him a Testimonial‚ written and figned
with his own Hand, as to the Integrity of his past Behaviour, affirming,
amongst other Things, That he had behaved himst’lf in ficch a Manner, that he
was, by the Consent of all of them, appointed to the pastoral Office. And in the
Conclufion he adds, Lcfl any one should suspe& any other Reason why Sebastiam went
from us, we testify to all wheresoever he may come, <I hat he himself ‘ohluntarily left the
School, andfh behaved himseffin ic, as that we acffjudged him worthy this sacred ffli-
