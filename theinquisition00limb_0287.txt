Of the SPAN1sH INQUISITION.

N the preceding Chapters we have seen how the Inquifition was brought
into several Kingdoms of Spain, but as yet it had not been fixed in Castile

and Leon, or was there grown into Disuse. Ferdinand and [sabel having united
the several Kingdoms of Spain by their Inter-marriage, after having obtain*
ed signal Victories over the Moors‚ order'd Tribunals of the Inquifition to be
erected throughout all their Kingdoms. It is not easy to be determined whe<
ther they did this out of their blind Zeal for Religion, or that they might pos-
sess their Kingdoms in greater Peace and Security, after having expelled the
Mahometan and Jewish Superstitions out of them, or, as some believe, because
they affeeted the universal Monarchy of Europe, and therefore, by some n0=
table Undertaking, to ssiew their great Zeal for the Roman Religion, endea-
vour’d to secure the Good-Will and F avour of* the Pope. However‚ as the
Inquifition had flourilhed for many Years in Italy, France, Germany, Polmzd,
and Aragon, they introduced'the Inquifition into all their Kingdoms by Au-
thority of Pope Sixtus, with greater Pomp, Magnificence and Power, that
they might not be exceeded by any Nation, but might rather exceed all others,
in their Endeavours to maintain the Roman F aith against all Oppofition. The
Pretence was this ε

and Familiarity some Christians might be eafily infe&ed, and others forsake
the Christian Worssiip which they had received, after having renounced their
native Superstition‚ being weak in the F aith, and having none to forbid them.
The Infeeision was said to have spread most at Seville, where many, after
beIng privately put to the Qestion, suffered the most grievous Punilhments,

apostatized to Judaism. This Man was informed by a certain Citizen of the
Family of the Gusmcms, that on a Thursdczy, during the Festival of the Sa*
erament, the first Vigil of the Night, several Jews and Apostates had got:
together in some Houses, and there performed the Jewifh Ceremonies, and
uttered execrable Blasphemiesand Reproaches against our Saviour. All these
'Ilhings Gusmcm saw with his Eyes in a private Part ofa House, where he con—
cealed himself with a Girl. The Prior persuaded Gusman to write all these
Things down, and sign them with his Name, and then immediately went and
discover'd all to the King and Qeen at Cordova. They ordered that the Af*
