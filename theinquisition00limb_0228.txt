60 The Hts‘rom‘ ofthe INQutstrton.

C H A P. X.
Of DOMINICUS‚ and thefiaest Rise ofthe Tholouse INQs1s1T10N..

H U S far we have confider’d the Method of Proceeding against Here-

ticks‚ as committed to the Bishops, with whomw. the Governrnent and ·

Care of the Churches were entrusted‚ according to the received Decrees of the

Church of Rome. But inasmuch as their Number- did not seem sufficient to

that Court, or because they were too negligent in the Affair, and did not pro,-

ceed with that Fury against Hereticks as the Pope would have had thern3

therefore, that he might put a Stop to the encreafing Progress of Herefies,

and more effectually extinguish them, about the Year of our Lord‚ 1200.

he founded the Order of the Dominicans and Franczscans‚ that they might

preach against Herefies. Dominick and his F ollowers were sent into the>

Country of Tholouse, where he preached, with great Vehemence, against the-

Hereticks that were arisen there; from whence his Order hath obtained the

Name of Preachers‚ or Predicants. Father· Francis, with his Disciples‚ batteled

it with the Hereticks of Italy. They were both commanded by the Pope, to

excite the Catholick Princes and People to extirpate Hereticks·, and in all

Places to enquire out their Number and Qality, and also the Zeal of the

Catholicks and Bilhops in their Extirpation ς and. t0= transmit a faithful Ac·
count to Rome. Hence they were called Inquzfitors.

lt is evident that the first Inquifitors were Dominican Friars, or of the Or·-

der of Predicants ·, but 'tis not so cer-rain what Year the Inquifition it self was

first introduced. Dominick, as bath? been said, was sent into the Country of

De succes. Tholouse‚ * or Gallia Narbonenfis ,· He, as Bertrand relates in his Account- of the

Ecclfff in Affairs of Tholouse‚ whom Uffl>r citeS, first lodged in the House· of a certain

effideme’ Nobleman‚ to whom belonged the House of the Inquisition at Tholouse‚ near

ς’ 9· β’ 9· the Castle of> Narbonne3 and finding him sadly infestedwith Heresy, Father·

Dominick, Inquisitor of the Fami, reduced him to the Path of Truth ; upon

which‚he devoted himselfand his House‚ to St. Dominick and his Order : Which

House hath ever fince belonged vto the Inquifition‚ and the Dominjcan Order2

From hence we may gather„ that Dominick was the first Inquifitor 3 and that

the inquisition was first introduced into Tholousb: But as to the Year when, Wrza-

ters differ ; some referring it to the Year of·- Christ, 1212 rothers to 1208 3

and others to 1215. This is certain, and agreed by all, that it began under

the Papacy of Irmocent III. and that Dominick was appointed the first Inquifitor ’

in Gallia Narbonelfis: But whether he received his Office of. Inquifitor from

Arnaldus, AbbotofCisteaux, Icus-‘grite of theApostolickSee, in France‚ or irn-

mediately froin the Pope, is dismanted by the Popish Writers. *Those who en-

deavour to reconcile the Difielcnce‚ say that Dominick was first appointed¹

* That Part of France, which anciently contained the Prov‘mces of swoy, Dauphing, province,
md Languedac. {nqu}
