Inquifitor 3because by wearing his Croffl’s he could find no Persons and Plaee, where he ι

could get his Living, and that therefore he stood for ten Years without them at the
Moyffac, and got his Livelihood by going and coming with the Ships to Bourdeaux.
But there is some Difference in the Manner of wearin these Crosses, for·
they are not always fixed on the penitential Habits the ame way. For, in
the first place, the Council of Tholouse‚ An. 1229. held against Heretics, harh
thus determined concerning them. Also in Detestation of their former Error, let

them wear two Croffes for the future on the Top of their Garments, of a different
Colour from their Cloaths, one on the right, and the other on the left·, and let not any

one be excused on Account of these Croffes, unless he can produce the Letters Testimo-
nialof his Bffhop, as to his Reconciliation. These Croffes were so placed, as
that they exaffly answered the two Breasts, as appears by the Letters of· Do-
nunick. Let them be cloathed with religious Garment5, both as to Shape and Colour,
on which let two small Croffes be fhwn direetly upon each Breast. But afterwards
that these Penitents might be more openly and fully exposed to the View os
all Persons, whether they stood before or behind them, 'twas decreed that
they should wear one before upon their Breasts, and the other behind between
their Shoulders. Thus we read in the Αᾶε of the Council of Biterre, c. 26,
In Detestation of their former Error, let them wear upon their outward Garment,
two Croſjes of a yellow Colour, two Spans and a haff long, and two wide, and ha-
ving the Breadth of three Fingers in themfhlves, one before on their Breast, and the
other behind between their Shoulders, not having that upper Garment‚ upon which
they wear the Croffes, of a yellow Colour‚ neither shall they put any Thing over it,-
either within Doors or without. And if they are convitted Hereticks, or condemned,
let them wear a third Cross of a competent Largeneſs, or of the same Colour, upon
their Hat or Veil. And if they happen to beforsworn, or have caused others' to for.
ylwear thenifi’lves‚ let them wear upon the. upper Part of the two Croffi’sv, which

they carry upon⁴ their Breast, and between their shoulders a Cross—Arm or Bar of

a Span long, or thereahouts.. ‘Thoſse who are to transport themselves must wear the
aforesaid Croffls, till they are got beyond Sea, but shall not be obliged to wear them
aster that, till they shall coine to the Shore to go aboard, in order to their Return, but
they shall always wear them on the Sea-shore, when at Sea, and in the Istes. This
Garment was formerly of a black and bluilh Colour, like a Monk’s- Cloak,
made without a Coul, and the Croffes put on thern were strant, having one
Arm long, and the other a-cross‚ after this manner †. Sometimes accord-⁴
ing to the Heinousness os the Offence, there were two Arms a-cross, after
aire* ¹this manner ss. But now in Spain this Garment is of, a yellow Colour, and

eloth must be long too. But afterwards, upon Account of the Croffes being.

was reduced to a shorter Measure. In. some Tribunals also of Spain, another
