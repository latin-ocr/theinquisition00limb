The Hrhs‘ronr ofthe Inoursrrrox. 163

this Day. And because these two Inquisitions are now the principal and most
famous ones, wherein‘ they differ from other Inquifitions, Ι shall caresully de-
scribe, and give an Account of the several Offices in them, as they are de·
livered by the Spanilh Βοᾶοτς.

Simaitca's gives us this Account of the Ministers of the Spanifh Inquifition.ne cathol.
“ In every Province of Spain there ought to be two or three Inquifitors, onefnst· ω·
“ Judge of the 'forfeited Effeets, one Execut0r‚ three NotarieS, two foi-4¹· §- 3·
“ Secrecy, 'and the third for Sequestrations, one Keeper of thePrison, one
‘⁴ Meffcnger, one Door-keper, and one Phyfician. Befides these, Affessors,
‘⁶ skilful Counsellors, F amiliars and others are necessary.’' In Italy they call
thern Cross-bearers, of pretty near the same Office with the Spanifh Famili-
ars. Resides these, there is a Promoter Fiscal‚ a Receiver of the for·
feired Effe&s; and finally, Vifitors of the Inquifitors. Of these in their

Order.

'Of the INQ1s11-ons.

N the Church of Rome there are two Sorts of Judges in the Affair of the Eymerie‘.

Faith: The ordinaries, such as the Pope, and Bishops of Places, who Dio-23. ,

when ordained or consecrated, are believ'd to receive, by divine Rightss· 3· 9· ⁸¹
Power and Jurisdiffion over Hereticks z And Delegates‚ to whom the Office
ofjudging Hereticks is particularly given by the Pope, who are called Inquisi-
tors by the Laws. Apostolick Inquifitors are therefore Judges delegated by the
Pope, who is believed to be the supreme Judge of the Faith‚ who grants
thern full jurisdiction against all Hereticks and ApostateS. And they are de·

legated for all Causes.
No one can be thus deputed to this Office who is not forty Years old. We or- Clement,

dain hythe Approbation of this holy Council‚ that no Perfim under forty Years old, shall “P- Nalm}
from this ff ime be admitted to the Office qf the Inquisition. But because Knowledge and ξς· ‘¹‘ ¹³⁴²
Prudence sometimes supply the Defest of Age, ’tis determined by a gene· ”

ral Decree of the Pope, that a Person of thirty Years old may be Apostolick
Inquisitor in Spain and Portugal. Even in this Age the Congregation of Cardi· &femi ,
nals created Baptist a Martineng0‚ Inquifitor at Cremona, who was very littless· ¹¹23 '⁶ ’ᾗ
above thirty. ’Tis also the Custom to chuse Inquifitors for Cities, not out of ’ .q.
the CitizenS, but from Foreigners.

These Inquisitors receive Power to execute this Office from the Pope, who
sometimes immediately appoints them by Word of Mouth‚ sometimes by his
Apostolick Letters. Thus in the Letters os Clement, beginning, Licet ex om-
nihus mundi partibus, writte'n to the Inquisitors ς we read, T hat the Office qf the
Inquifition against Hereticks may beY more effeelually dfiharged, we commansssyour
