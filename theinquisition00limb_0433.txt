and Ecclefiastical Offices. Some are civil, which the Civil Laws have enae'ted,
such as the depriving Men of the privileges and Benefits of Law, pecuniary
Mulsts, Baniihment‚ Death, and the Bann. Some are mixed, ordained both by
the‘sacred CanonS, and the imperial Laws 3 such as Confiscation of Goods‚ ab-
solving Subjects from their Allegiance,1nfamy‚ and the Ecclesiastieallnterdifft.
1 choose rather to distinguish Punishments only into Ecclefiastical and Civil.
By Ecclefiastical‚ I mean those which are inflicted onany one confidered as a
Member of the Church, and which are supposed -to derive on him some spiri-
tual Evil. By Civil, I understand such Punilhments as refer to the Body or
Estate of any one, and are inflicsted on him as a Member of Civil Society‚
whether they are appointed by the Civil or Canon Law, or by both.

have no Foundation in Scripture, by Force, and dreadful Punishments, and
extort that Con'feffion by the F ear of Punishment‚ which they can never per-
suade the Mind of the Truth of, as being destitute of the Weight of Reason,
and the clear Testimony of Scripture. But 'tis time to return to our Subjeet.

The Ceremony of Excommunication is thus: When the Bilhop pronouncesBrunus,

a Letter is sent about to the ParisheS, containing the Names of the excommuni-

Excommunication is either the greater or the less. Of both the Synod of
Nimes hath thus decreed‚ An. 1284. The greater Excommunication is, when
the Prelate says, I excommunicate thee. T his Excommunication fhparates a Per·
son from the Communion of the faithful, and the Participation and Perception of the
Sacraments. The lesser Excommunication is, when any one communicates with a
Persen under the greater Excommunication3 by thus partaking with him he is removed
from the Perception of the Sacraments, so that he ought not to receive the Eucharist or
other Sacraments, till he is absolved. An Interdict is, when the Prelate fizys, I in-
