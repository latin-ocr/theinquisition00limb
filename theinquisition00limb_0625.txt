Grievances, and again and again demands * Letters of Appeal ·, the {aquisg-
tor, after such an Appeal is exhibited to him, must, within thirty Days‚ exa-
mine the Reasons ofsuch an Appeal, and if after having taken the Advice of
proper Persons‚ he finds that he hath unjustly aggrieved the accused Person,
he must, at the Terin affigned, amend what hath been amiss, remedy the
Grievances complained of, and bring the Process to {ts former State, and then
proceed as before. For when the Grievance is removed, the Appeal is
void.

As to irreparable Grievances, there must be a very cautious Procedure, nor
must any one be put to the Torture without legal Proofs0 This is taken Care
of by the Madria' Instructiom An. 1561. c. 50. The Inquifitors ought especially to
confides, whether the Sentence of pulling the Criminal to the Tortore bejostly pro-
nounced‚ and upon legal Procfs proceeding. Ano· when tbey doubt of this, let them
grant to the Criminal his Appeal when he demands it, because patting him to the Tor-
ture is doing him an irreparable Injury, and because an Appeal from the interlocutory
Sentence of the Judge is allowed in the Cause of Heresy. But if they have no such
Doubt, but rather think the Proofs resulting from the Process are legal, then let them.
proceed to the ‘Torture without Deloy ·, because an Appeol‚ in such Caso, would be
deomedfrz'volous. But in a doubtful Case the Appeal must always be allowed, and
the Inquisttors must farther constder the Matter‚ nor pronounce Sentence of Torture,
nor proceed to the Execution of it² till the Couse is fimfhed, and the Defences of the
Criminal received. For if there have been such Grievances as these, the Pro·
cess can’t be reduced to its former· State.

If the Inquifitor believes that he hath not proceeded unjustly,heaffigns‚ with-
in thirty Days, to the accused Person a certain Term, specifying particularly the
Place, Day‚ and Hour, for his having given him, and receiving from the Inqui-
fitor such Letters of Appeal, as the Inquifitor shall determine to give him. Ifhe
finds the Causes of the Appeal to be false or frivolous‚ or void, and that the Ap-
pellant only endeavours to escape Judgment‚ the Inquisitor gives him what
they call negative Letters, or Letters of Refutation, in which he refutes all
the Reasons alledged in Support of such Grievances, and says, that he doth
not admit, nor intend to admit the Appeal put in, and that he pays no Re-
gard to it, nor ever intends it. This is the Answer he gives to him who ap·
{32¹5 tisssjhstssgzaivssiceieffieci {ffffissdzff} ffieffsffissfiffefsirif 1¹22} {fii} {3325ssssssssss
presented it. But if he finds the Grievances to be real, and unjustly laid on
him, and t'o be irreparable 3 or if he is in doubt concerning these Things, he
gives the Appellant what they call affirmative Letters, or Letters of Reve-

renco, in which he says he harh proceededjustly 3 and after running thro‘ the q

several causes oi the Appeal, and answering them, at length concludes, that
¹he hath given no Cause of Appeal. But that nevertheless for the Reverence
he bears to the Apostolick See, which is appealed to, he allows the Appeal,

* Apostoli. Those Apostoli were dimiffory Letters, granted by aeclesiastica] officials and Judgcss·
to those who appealed to the Pope at Rome.> ' ’
