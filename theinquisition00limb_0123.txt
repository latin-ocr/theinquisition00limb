dered him to hay thee, falls into some Errors, as the Consequence of human
&Veaknesffi than with that imperious and tyrannical Disciple‚ who divides
thy Members, tares the Bowels of thy Church‚ and spreads Confnfion and
Strife throughout thy followers and Friends‚ even for the sake of Truths
that lie remote from Mens Understanding‚ and in which thou hast not though:
proper to make the full, the plain Decision. If Truth is noc to be given‘up
sor the sake of Peace‚ I am sure Peace is not to be sacrificed for the sake of
such Truths; and if the Gospel is a Rule worthy our Regard, the Clergy o't'
those Times can never be excused for the Contentions they raised, and the
Miseriesthey occasioned in the Christian &3⁷erld, upon Account of them.
The third and fourth General Conncils seern to· have met upon an Occa—
fion of much the like Importance· The first Council of N'ice, determined the
Son to be a distinet Hypostalis‚ or Person from, bu: of the same Nature with
the Father. The second at Constantinople‚ added the Holy Ghost to the sante
Substance of the Father‚ and made the same individual Nature to belong
equally and wholly, to Father, Son, and Holy Gh0st; thus making them three
distin& Persons in one undivided Essence· Eut as they determined the Son to
be truly Man, as well as truly God, the Bishops brought a new Controver-
sy into the Church, and fell into furious Debates and errels about his
Personality. Nestorius, Bishop of Constantinople, with his Pomm-ers, main-
tained two distinet Persons in Christ, agreeable to his two distinet Natures.
But Saint Crril‚ the implacable Enemy of Nestorius, got a Council to decree,
that the two Natures of God and Man being united together in our Lord,
made one Person or Christ, and to curse all who should affirm that there
were two distinet Persons or Subsistences in him. 'Tis evident, that either
cyril, and his Council, must have been in the wrong in this Decree, or the
two former Councils of Nice and Constantinople wrong in theirs; because ’tis
certain, that they decreed the Word PE R S O N to be used in two infi-
nitely different Senses. According to those of Nice and Constantinople, one
individual Nature or Essence contain'd three distin& Persons. According to
Cyril's Council, two Natures or Effences infinitely different, and as distinet as
those of God and Man, constituted but one Person. Now how sne Maure
fhould be three Perfims, ancl yet two Natus-es one Perfhn, will require tlte Skizl even
of Infallibility it self to explain ,· and as these Decrees are evidently contra-
dietory to one another, I am afraid we must allow, that the Holy Ghost had.
no Hand in one or other of them. This some of the Clergy very easily ob-
served; and therefore, to maintain the Unity of the Person of Clu-ist, Eut)-
ches and Dioscorus maintained, that though Christ consisted oftwo Natures be-
fore his Incarnation‚ yet after that, he had but one Nature only. Eut this
was condemned by the Council of Chalcedon, and the Contradictions of the
former Councils declared all to be true, and render'd sacred with the Stamp
of Orthodoxy. This was also ratified by the fifth Council under szs'J-‘iii‘lf1'2
who also pioussy and charitably raked into the Dust of poor Oxigm, and
damned him for an Heretick. But still there was a Difficulty yet remaining,

about the Person οἱ Christ z For as Christ’s being one Person did not ἀείὶξὲγ
