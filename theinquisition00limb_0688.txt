The H1 STORY ofthe INQmsn-mu.

to obey the Conzmands of the Church, and either have, or have not obtained the
Benefit of Absolution‚ refusing to objerve and do the Penance of Inzprisonment injoined
them, either hy not going into Jayl, or getting out of it after their Entrance‚ or any
other Penance whatsoever, or thro’ Contumacy, ahsenting themselves from receiving
it, thus become Rei-ets, and thus openly manifest their Inipenitency and seigned Con-
vef'sion, be left by you, without any s‘arfher Audience at all, to the setulas* Judgment‚
to he punifhez‘i aceording fo their Desert, sim 'tis sufficient that they have once deceived
the C hurch hy afaifi‘ Con-veifion. ’

They are now also condemned to the Punishment of the GaIlies, because.
the antient Praetice of Immuration is at this Time seldom used. This is con-
firmed by Royas, p. 2. Aſjert. 15. ᾗ. 202. ‘⁴ It was a Custom very frequent
“ and usual in the Court of the Inquisltion, that a Person condemned to a per-
“ petual Jayl, should be dispensed with by the Inquifitor General, after three
“ Years. But that if any one was condemned to perpetual and unredeemable
“ Imprisonmenn ifhe appeared humble and truly penitent‚ he should be dis-
“ pensed with after eight Years. But now instead of perpetual Imprisonmenss
“ Here„ icks are condemned to the Gallies, provided they are not weak or aged.
‘⁶ Such Condemnation must not be ior less than three Years, lest the Excite-
“ quer should receive more Damage than Benefit bys the Expence&v Thus
‘⁶ the supream and general Council of the Inquisition hath decreed. These
f‘ are the Punishments of Penitents.

Others will not depart from their Errors, but obstinately perfist in thern
for a great while, and at length perhaps more thro' F ear of Death than the
Love of Truth, depart from them, or pretend to do it, and abjure 3· and·
therefore they don’t give much Credit to their Abjurations. Such are ordina—
rily condemned to perpetual and stri& Imprisonment‚ and to Iron F etters and
Chains, where they are daily allowed the Bread of Grief for Meat‚ and the
Water oi Affliffion for their Drink. To this- Purpose is the Decree of the
Council of Biterre, c. 2 3. Take Care however, that, according-to the Appointment
of the Apostolick See, separate and fiecret Cells he appointed to such as are to he immu-
νεά, as it can he conveniently done in the fiveral Cities of the corrupted Diooefts, that
they may neither he ableto pervert themselves or others.

The Inquifitors may also increase these Penances, if the converted Persons
want Devoti0n‚ or are malicious and quarrelsome, because these Things ffiew
that their Mind and Soul is far from being obedient to the Law of God, or the
Commands injoined them. Hence it* is that the Council of Narbonne gives this
Caution to the Inquifitors, c. 7. This Restribiion always carefully ohserved,
that it may be lawful or you, or the other Inquisttors,. or those to whom the
Church of Rome fhal think proper to commit this Affair, or he to whom it
belongs by Offioe, according to your or their Pleasure and triti, to add to, or
take from the Penances injoined at any time sor a reasonable Cause, The
Council of Biterre gives this sarther Caution‚ c. 22. Always retaining to your
solves this Power‚ that if you shall think it expedient for the Affair of the Faue,
you may, without any new Cause, bring back again the aforesaid Perstms to Jayl.
Hence also in the Book of the Sentences of the Tholouse Inquifidon, the Iryqui-
