“ ticks, their Children are exempted from them. As ro the Children of
“ such who return, and are received to Mercy, though once Hereticks, and
‘⁴ theirs who have been suspec‘lted, but died with Purgation enjoined them, or
‘⁶ not, these Punishments are not to be inflicsted on them. The third Puniih-
‘⁴ ment only is to be laid on the Children of Persons suspected of Heresy, be-
“ cause of their favouring, defending and receiving it, if their Parents die
“ such. But if they die after being received to Mercy, and Penance enjoin’d
“ thern, even this Punishment dothnot pass to their Children, whether they
“ have accomplished their Penance or not„

‘⁶ As to the penitentia] Punishrnents, some are of such a Nature, as that:
“ they may be fulfilled by others ·‚ particularly pecuniary ones ς such as the
‘⁶ building a Church or Hospital‚ the giving Portions to. poor Girls, the pay.
“ ing a Fine, the returning of Usury. If any one dies before the Accom-
“ plishment of such Penance‚ his Children and Heirs are obliged to fulfil it.
‘⁶ Others are personal, such as to pray, fast, hear Divinity, to hear Mass
“ every Day, to abjure their Error, and be confeffed every Week. These
“ cannot pass to the Children or Heirs, but are reserved sor Purgatory.''³

Pegna agrees with this Account. “ The Heirs of suspected Persons, Fa· nimam}
‘¹‘ vourers of Hereticks, &a cannot be compelled to perform the personalqu P· 3·
“ Penance enjoined a suspected Person, but not accomplished by him. Butssmmlgb
“ they may be compelled to accomplilh the Penance enjoined him when ” ’
“ living out of his Effecsts. If therefore it was enjoined him to build a Church Cap. 4⁶⁰⁶

“ accomplish this Penance, to whatsoever Successor or particular Person such smalh,
‘⁶ Estate shall devolve after his Death, it must come to him under such Obli-
“ gation.’' The same is provided for also by the Council of Biterre, Let the Cap. ¹9·
same take place with respo& to those, who die without fulfilling the Penance enjoined

them, if they have delayed it, or bound their Estotefor Performance of it.
