Persecutiom and dreadsul Miseries ofothers ? And what could an unprejudice'd
Person, acquainted with this melancholy Trurh, and who had never seen the
sacred Records‚ nor informed himself from thence os the genuine Nature ol
Christianity‚ think, but that it was one of the worst Religions in the world,
as tending to destroy all the naturalSentiments of Humanity and Compfffion,
and inspiring its Votaries with that Wzfflom which is from hemath, and which is
earthly‚ semilaland devilifh? If this Charge could be justly fixed upon the Reli—
gion of Christ, it would be unworthy the Regard os every wise and good Man,
and render it both tlie Interest and Duty os every Nation in the &Vorld to
re'e& it.

‚1st must be allowed by all who know any Thing ofthe Progress of the Christian
Religion, that the first Preachers and Propagators ofit used none ofthese vile Me-
thods to support and spread it. Both their Doetrines and Lives destrov every Suspi-
cion ofthis Nature; and yet in their Times the beginnings ofthis Spirit appeared:
Diotrephes loved the Preheminence, and therefore would not own and receive the
inspired Apostle. W-ealso read, that there were great Divisions and Schisms
in the Church of Corinfh, and that many grievous Disorders were caused there-
in, by their ranking themselves under different Leaders and Heads of Parties,
one being for Paul, another for Apollas, and others for Cephas. These Ani-
mofities were difficultly healed by the Apostolick Authority ·, but do not how-
ever appear to have broken out into mutual Hatreds, to the open Disgrace of
the Christian Name and Profeffion. The Primitive Christians seem for many
Years generally to have maintained the warmest Affeei ion for each other, and
to have distinguished themselves by their mutual Love, the great Charasteri·
stick of the Disciples ofChrist. The Gospels, and the Epistles of the Apostles
all breath with this amiable Spirit, and abound with Exhortations to cultivate
this God-like Disposition. 'Tis reported of St. John, that in his extreme old Hieron. in
Age at Ephesus, being carried into the Church by the Disciples‚ upon accountG2l· Ε· ⁶·
os his great Weakness, he used to say nothing else every Time he was brought
there, but this remarkable Sentence‚ Filioli diligite alterutrum, Little Children
love one another. And when some of the Brethren were tired with hearing so of-
ten the same Thing, and asked him, Sir, Why do you always repeat this Sen-
tence 3 he answered with a Spirit worthy an Apol'tle, Quia preceptum Domini

very good Influence in keeping alive the Spirit of Charity and mutual Love,
And indeed the Primitive Christians were so very remarkable for this Temper,
that they were taken notice of on this very Account, and recommended even
by their Enemies as Patterns of Beneficence and Kindness.

But at length, in the second Century, the Spirit of Pride and Domination
appeared publickly‚ and created great Disorders and Schisms amongst Christi-
ans. There had been a Controversy of some standing, on what Day Easter
should be celebrated. The Astatick Churches thought that it ought to be kept on
the same Day on which the Jews held the Paffover‚ the fourteentli Day of Ni-
sam their first Month, on whatsoever Day of the Week it should fall out.C s'trhe
