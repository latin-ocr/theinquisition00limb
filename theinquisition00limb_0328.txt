- HE Inquisition was introduced into the Low Countries in the Year 1522-
and Francis Hulsizts, and Nicolas Egmondanus, a Carmelite F riar, were ap-
Ερξβ, lib. pointed Inquisitors‚ of whom Erafinus thus writes to John Carondilet, Archbishop
312 of Palermo, in the Year 1524. And now the Sword is given to two violent⁴
Haters of good Learning‚ Hulstus, and Egmondanus, &a ff they have a Spite
against any Man, they throw him into Pristin 3 here the Matter is tranfhbi‘ed bea
tween a· few, and the Innocent suffers barbarous Usage‚ that they may not lose any
Thing of their Authority 3 and when they find they have done entirely wrong, they
cry out, We must take Care of the Faith. In the same Year he writes to Bili-
-Epistdia baldus Pirkheimerus. There (viz. in the Country of Erasinus) reigns Egrnonm
30·- danuS, a furious Person, armed with the Sword‚ who hates me twice more than he·
doth Luther. His Collegae is Francis Hulst, a great Enemy of Learning. ‘They
first throw Men into Prison, and then seek out for Crimes to accuse them of. These
Things the Emperor is ignorant of, though it would he worth his while to know them.
A great many were miserably used, and barbaroussy ssain through their
Cr-uelt .

the· Inquifition more openly into the Netherlands, after the Manner, ofv
that in Spain, byvan Edi& against Heresy and Hereticks 3⁷ in which he com--

required by the Inquifitors‚ and at the joint Request of the Ordinaries or Bi-
ssiopS, to proceed against any one in the Affair of Heresy, to give them their*
utmost Affistance and Countenance, and to help them in the Execution of their
Office, and in apprehending and detaining those, whom they should discover
t0.be inseeted with heretical Pravity, according to the InstruEtions which the.
aforesaid Inqu‘fitors had received from him. In the Conclufion ''tis added,·‚
that they should proceed against Transgreffors by Execution, whatever -Pri-
vileges had been before granted contrary to this Decree. This Edi& occa-
fioned great Disturbances, especially at Antwerp, where when· it was known
sor certain, and that is was soon to be publish'd, a great Number of Mer-

Wesen- chants determin'd to go into-other Places. As this would occasion great
bec-de Loss to the City, and ruin their Trade, the Magistrates called together the
ῙῘΜΒἾΕῙ· chief Merchants, and Citizens, and enquired what Loss the City had already
