which Sodomy is one, are extinguished by the Death of the Delinquent‚
ς. ςι. Nor do they proceed against a dead Sodomite, nor confiscate his Effests‚ or
l. 2, c. 26.although he harh been convieted or confessed when he was alive. If such a
5- 30· one takes Sanctuary in a Church, he can’t be taken out of it.

If we compare these Things with the Punishrnents of Hereticks, as related
in the second Chapter of this Book, it will appear, that the Crime of So-
domy in the Kingdom of Portugal is esteemed a much smaller one than that
of Heresy, because sodomites enjoy Privileges which are denied to HeretickS.
And yet it may happen, that a truly pious Man, who fears God, and is
most careful of his eternal Salvation, may be accounted an Heretick by the
Pet-tuguese lnquifitors, whereas aSodomite cannot but be the vilest of Men.

But 'tis not at all strange, that by the Laws of that Tribunal, Barabbas
should be restased, and Christ crucified.

 

C H A P. XVIII.

Of one that is irgsbrdcscent in Excommunication.

Carena, Man is said to be insordescent in Excommunication, who, after he
p. ι.. t. 8. hath been by Name declared Excommunicate, perfists in that Ex·
§- 2. communication for a Year. The Nature oi this Crime requires Obstinacy

of Mind, including the Contempt of the Keys. This they infer, when the
excommunicated Person hath had Knowledge of the Excommunication, and
taken no Care to obtain Absolution. For if within a Year he endeavours to
obtain Absoludon, though he should not affitually receive it3 or if there be
εῐέγέεαΙ Hindrance that prevents his Appearance, hc is not judged guilty
o ontem t.

ςς. 32 He wholghus persists in his Excomrnunication, is accounted as conieffed
and convicted of the Crime for which he was excommunicated ·, nor is he to
be any farther heard, unless he can demonstrate his Innocence with new
Proofs. If the Crime for which he was excommunicated be of the Number
of those, which do, ipso jure, infer Privation, hc must be deprived of his
Benefice for Insordescence. But if it be such a Crime for which the Delin-
quent is to be deprived of his Benefice, but not ipſs) jure, in such a Case he is
also to be deprived for Insordescence.

3, ς, ²¹³9· He who thus perfists in Excommunication, is violently suspected of Heresy.
For if there be only a light Suspicion of Heresy against any Person, and if
when cited he is obstinate, the Suspicion then begins to be vehement. If
through Contumacy he continues in Excommunication for a Year, the ve·
hement Presumption becomes violent, and thus he may be taken for an He-
retick, and punistied as such. Because, from thus perfisting, there arises a

Presumption of the Law, and dejure, by which the Crime of Heresy is suf-
ficicntly proved. But
