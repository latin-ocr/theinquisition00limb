εοηνῐᾶεά by certain WitneffeS, some of them fingle, ol certain heretical
Facts. This Person was pronounced an Heretick by a definitive Sentence‚
and as such deliver’d over to the secular Court. But upon this Condition,
that if within fifteen DayS, each five of which were affigned him as so many
Terms, he would confess his Crimes‚ and with a pure Heart and Faith un-
feigned return to the* Ecclesiastical Unity, abjure all Heresy, and swear fim-
ply to obey the Commands of the Church and lnquifitor3‚ he ssiould be ab·
· solved from Excommunication‚ and condemned to perpetual Imprison-
l ment.

We read in the first Seville Instruction, e. 15. ffhat he who afterwards retrafi‘m. 80.
l the Confeffion extorted from him by Torture, must solemnly abjure thos} Errors of
4¹ which he was dqfamed, and suffer some pecuniary Penalty at the Pleafhre of his
Judges‚ upon account of the Infamy and Suspicion yet remaining against him. But for
all this the Inquifizors ostentirnes order the Qestion in this Case to be repeated.
Skilful Judges usually enter a Protest in the Acts of the Process, that
they intend to carry on the Torture some other Day, that they may be able
to repeat it. But Royas says, some Criminals are so crasty, that he hath of-par. ι.

confirm it, and when tortured again consess again, and retract again, and re·
peat the same as often as they are tortured. In which Case‚ to prevent the
Process from being never finished, he thinks they are to be punished with a
very grievous arbitrary Penalty‚ because of so many Variations‚ which occa·
sion Proofs and bad Presumptions. For by the same Reason any one may
be tortured again, he may be punished in an extraordinaty Manner.
Is he doth not persist in his first Confession, and is not sufficiently tortured,
he may be put to the Torture again, not by way of Repetition‚ but Conti-
nuation of it 3 but they do not agree how osten it may be repeated, when the
Confeffion extorted by it is retraeted. Some affirm it may be repeated once
only, others that it may be often. Eymerick’s Opinion is, that a Person sus-
ficiently tortured ought to be dismissed sreely, is he retracts what he con-
feffed by Torture. But Simancas says, that a Criminal must not be condemned h65·§-67'.
for a Confeffion drawn out by Torture, unless he afterwards perseveres in it. ⁶ 3> ⁶9·
’Tis the same in Law, if it be extorted by F ear, or Dread of impending Tor-
ments. The Confeffion is then said to be extorted thro' F ear of Torments, when
the Criminal is carried to the Place in which the Torture is infliered, and there
stript of his Cloaths, or bound, or so terrified by the Judge‚ as that he hath
great Reason to believe the Torture will be inflicted. For ’tis not enough ifthe
Judge frightens him but ssightly in any other Place, unless it be such a Fear as
may affe& a Person of Resolution. Hence the Light of the Inquifitors says, ιη voce
“ Altho’ the Judge says to the Criminal, when he is out of the Place of Tortura.
