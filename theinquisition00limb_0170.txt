The H1s‘ronr of the INQUISITroN:

Faith ·‚ not invented by human Wisdom and Council, but given to Men by.
the immediate Influence of Heaven, whose Tribunal breathes nothing bute
Holiness, and to which they give such Titles as denote the most perse&
Sanctity. The Inquisltion it sels is called the Holy Office3 the Prison of the
Inquifition the Holy Houft’, so that the very Name raises it Respe& and Vene-
ration: Yea, they go so far as to compare it with, the Sun3 and affirm,
that as it would bc accounted ridiculous to commend and, extol the Sun, ic
would be equally so to pretend to praise the Inquisition. The Protestants
on the other hand represent it, not only as a cruel and bloody, but most
unjust Tribunal·‚ where, as the Laws by which other Tribunals are go-
verned are disregarded, so many Things, which every where else would be
esteerned Unrighteous‚ are commended as Holy. And they are so far from
thinking that it is a proper Means of restraining or punishing the Guilty„
(which is the principal Thing to be aim’d at by every Tribunal) that on the
contrary, they believe it was invented for the Oppreslion of Truth, 'andr
the Defence of Superstition and Tyranny 3 where Perions, let their Innocency
appear as bright as the Sun at Noon-day, are treated as ,the most vile and
perfidious Wretches, and cruelly put to Death by the severest Tortures. Β.
therefore thought it might be of Service to the World, to describe the Ori«

nerally proceed in it. In order to¹ this, it is neceffary to look back, and
deduce this whole Affair from the very Original.

The Christian Religion, taught by the inspired Apostles, made its Pro-
gress in the World, and shewed it self to be of Divine Originnl by the Ho-
liness of its Precepts, the exceeding Greatness of its Promises, and the many
Miracles wrought in Confirmation of it3 and, a-t· last, brought. the whole
‘World into its Obedience without the Affistance of Carnal Weapons5 or
Temporal Power. Our Lord himself expeeted only a voluntary Obedience
from Mankind3 as he required only to be worshipped in Spirit, and comv...
manded every one that would be his Disciple to deny himself, which is the·¹
