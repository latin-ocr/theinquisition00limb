 

The H1ST0R1⁷ ofthe INQUISITION. 165

The Popes were greatly defirous that this Office should be free from all Eymee.
Obstruction ς and therefore, as one very obvious Difficulty might arisedireff.
from the Prelates of the several ReligionS, if such as were created regular mmm· 3-
quisitors should be forced to obey their Prelates in their Office, therefore thequ' ἴτ’
Popes exempted them as to this Affair from their Jurisdic‘tion, as appears
from a Bull of Clement IV. beginning Catholicae Fidei. Although the Master and
Mnister Generals, and other Priors and Provincias, and the Keepers or Guar-
dians of any Places of your Orders, under pretence of any Privileges or Indulgences of
the same See, granted, or hereafter to be granted to the said Orders, shall enjoin‚
or any ways command you, or any one or more of you, to superfi’de this Affair for a
Time, or as to any certain Articles or Persons 3 we strictly prohibit all and fingular
‘ff you, by our Apostolick Authority, from prefitming to obey, . or in any manner to re·-
gard them in this Matter. For by the fl’enor of these present, we recall allfhch
Privileges and Indulgences relating to this Article‚ and decree that all Sentences of
Excommunication, Interdiu and Suspenfion, that may be pronounced against you, or
any of you upon this Occaston, fhall he altogether null and void. So that in the Of. ,Q ιι.
fiee of the Inquifition they are by no Means subject to their Superiors‚ but on-
lyto the Pope·‚ insomuch that if an Inquilitor should unjustly prosecute any
one for Heresy, the Person apprehended can’t appeal to the Superior of that
Religion, but only to the Pope. Nor is theInquisitor in any manner bound to
obey the Superior of his Religion, interrogating him. on any Affairs relating to
his Office, but the Pope alone, whom he immediately represents.

And least the Superiors of Orders should claim to themselves any Power
over the Inquifitors, by reason of their Inquisltorial Office, Urban IV. wrote
to the Inquisitors in Privilege of the Catholick F aith. Foris the aforesaid See
hath sometimes committed by their Letters‚ undera certain Form, to some Prelates cf
your Order, a Power to chuse certain Friars of their Orders to exercise the Office of
the Inquzfition against heretical Pravity, and to remove, and substitute others in their
Room, as they should think convenient 3 as this was granted them only, because it was

presumed that they had a fuller Knowledge of the Fz'tness of such Friars, so herehy no
Faculty, Jurisdz'c‘tion or Power is given them over any such Affair committed, and

to be committed to you immediately hythe aforcsszid S ee.

- This is in Force only when the Inquifitors are of any particular Order,
whither Predicants or F riars Minor. It is now of no Use in Spain ·‚ for, as
Simancas tells us, ’tis found by Experience, that ’tis much more useful andr't. μ-

of the Inquifitors thould be perpetual, so that it was not to cease at the
Death of the Pope who confer-red it, although the Jurisdi6H0n delegated to
thern might not have been made use of. Thus ’tis ordained by Clement-
IV. and is to be found in the Sext. Decret. Least any Perſsms should be

in doubt, whither the Office of the Inquifition of heretical Pravity‚ committed by
the Apostolick See under certain Limitations to your Care, expires at the Death of
the Pope who granted it, we by this present Edit? declare, that the fizid Office fhail
