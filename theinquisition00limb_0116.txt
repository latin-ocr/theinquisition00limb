the Honoiir of the Church of God, might, methinks, have screen’d him·

from all scurrilous AbuseS. But how numerous were his Adversarks, and

how hard the &Veapons with which they attacked him 1 Not only the Dregs

of the People and Clergy opened against him, but mighty Men, and Men of

great Renown, from whom better Things might have been expected, enter’d

the Lists with him 3 and because the avowed Champions for spiritual Power,

and the Division of the Kingdom between Christ Jesus and themselves. His

Lorship of Bangor had this manifest Advantage upon the Face of the Argu-4

nient. He pleaded for Christ’s being King in his own Kingdom· His Ad-
versaries pleaded for the Transsation of his Kingdom to certain spiritual

Viceroys- He for Liberty of private judgment in Matters of Religion

and Conscience. They for Dominion over the Faith and Consciences of
others. He against all the Methods of Persecution. They for penal Laws,

for Corporation and Test Acts, and the powerful Motives of pofitive and

negative DiscouragementS· He, with the Spiritof Meekness, and of aFriend

to Truth. They with Bitterness and Rancmrr, and an evident Regard to

Interest and Party- However, the lower House of Convocation accused and,
prosecuted him for attempting the Subverfion of all Government and Disci--
pline in the ‘Church of Christ, with a View, undoubtedly, of bringing him

under a spiritual Censure, and with impeaching the regal Supremacy in
Causes Ecclesiastical, to subject him to the Weight of a Civil one. Of the

Bilhop it must be said, to his everlasting Honour, that the Temper he dis-
covered, under the Oppofition he met with, and the Slanders that were

thrown on him, was as much more amiable than that of his Adversaries; 33,
his Cause was better, his &Vritings and I'rinciples more consistent, and his⁴
Arguments more conclusive and convincing. But notwithstanding these Ad-
vantages‚ his Lordstxip had great Reason to be thankful to God that the·
Civil Power supported and prote8oed him, otherwise his Enemies would not,
in all Probability, have been content with throwing Scandal upon his Cha·-
rabies, but forced him to have parted with S O M E T H I N G, and then-
delivered him unto Satan for the Punilhment of his Flesh, and made him

have felt the Weight of that Authority, which God made him the happy

and honourable Instrument of oppofing5 especially if they were all of them?

The Diffenters also have had their Qarrels and Controverfies amongs’t¹
themselves, and managed them with great Warmth and Eagerness of Tem-
ρετ. During their Persecution under King Clmrles ΙΙ. and the common:
Danger of the Nation under his Brother James‚ they kept tolerably quiet,-
the Designs of the common Enemy to ruin them all, uniting them the more
firmly amongst themselves. But after the Revolution, when they were se-
cure from Oppreffion by the civil Power, they soon fell into eager Disputes ,
about Justification and other Points oflike Nature. The high flown ortho-
dox Party would scarce own for their Brethrem those who were for Modera-
tion in these Principles, or who differed in the least from their Dofirine con-
