The HtsTom‘ of the INqusn-mn.

Sword os Hereticks. So that all piozts Men wzsh and pray‚ that another Prince may
7²st up equal in Piety to St. Lewis, who may restore the Tribztnals of the holy Faith
in France. I cannot help remarking, that from these Words we may learn,
not onlv what the Popes and their Devotees principally regard, viz. to re.-
store the Inquisition wherever 'tis lost, but who and what Sort of Persons are
their Saints‚ to whom they give such high Encomiums in theirWritings; not
Men remarkable for their Sanctity of Life, nor for governing their Actions ac-
cording to the Rule of the Christian Doctrina but Persons who have been the
most zealous Promoters of the Papal Authority, who have most advanced the
Power of the Church, and heaped upon the Ecclefiasticks the most ample Pos-
seffions and Riches. Philip de Comines hath a pleasant Story of this kind, in
his Commenta-ries of the Neapolitan War‚ Book 1. John Galeacins, first Duke
qu'zlan of that Name, had governed with great Cruelty and Pride, but had been
very liberal in his Donationis. I saw his Sepulchre in the Carthufians Church at
Papia, and as I was looking 072 it, one of them spoke to me of his Virtue, and
extolled his Piety. thy, fiziel I, do you thus praise him as a Saint ἒ You see there
are dra-1072 the Enfigns of many Peoffle, whom he subdued without any Right. Oh,
says he, 'tis our Custom to call them Saints‚ that have been our Benefcfflors. Hence
we may easily learn who are in their Account wicked and impious2Menst
Not such whose Manners are contrary to the Precepts ofJesus Christ, but who
oppose the exorbitant Power of the Pope, and the intolerable Yoke oft the
Ecclesiasticks ·‚ who affert the just Liberties of Mankind‚ and scorn to be th'e
vile Slaves of the Pope. These they point out to us as wicked Wretches‚ and
accuse of the worst of Crimes, and the most horrid Vices ; from whence it ap-
pears of it sels, what Credit is to be given to those Histories, which are
written only by Monks, those ,sworn Slaves to the Pope. But to return ε
W hen the Inquifition was once brought into France, the Pope carefully en-.
deavour'd to preserve it, and to cherish and enlarge, by all Measures, the
Jurisdiffion of that Tribunal. Such who were defamed for Heresy‚ and afraid
of being brought before the Tribunal of the Inquifition, fied to the ChurcheS,
for the Benefit of the Ecclefiastical Immunity, and could not be brought from
thence by Forte before the Inquisitors. The Pope seeing that by this Means

lege should not be allow'd them. Parthen to prevent the Roman-Catholick
Faith and Worship from being lost in those Provinces of Fretum, where lived
many of·the Valdenses, he transmitted to the Magistrates and Prefects of those
Places the Laws made by the Emperor Frederick'against Hereticks‚ that thcy

the Letters of Pope Clement IV. dated at Viterb0‚ Calend. Feb. 1267. by which
