their Faces with a red hot lron. And yet he could not escape the Pontiff's
a. τηρ. Thunder: For in the Year 1239. Pope Gregory pronounced the Sentence of
§·2, &a Excommumcation against him, and absolved all his Subjee‘ts from the Obli.
gation of any Duty or Oath they were under to him. Frederick gave an abun-
dant Answer, and purged himself of the Crimes objected to him in this Sen-
tence, in which there was no mention of Heresy. But the Pope sent Letters
to all the Prelates‚ and to the Christian Kings and Princes, in which he
charged him with various Heresle33 and, amidst others, with this: ‘Ibat
he constantly affirmed, that he could not be excommunicated by him as the Vicar of
Christ3 thus affirmz‘ng that the Power of Binding and Loofing was noc in the
Church, delivered by our Lord to Peter and his Sztcceffors. Whilst he thus afflrts
Heresy, his own Argument concludes against himself, fhewing by Consequence that he
heth wrong Sentiments concerning the other Articles of the orthodox Faith‚ as he en-
deavours to take away that Privilege of Power granted by the Word of God to the
Church, upon which the Faith is founded.
Neither did the Pope rest till he had put in Execution the Sentence he had
'a- 1255· pronounced against the Emperor Frederick. For in the Year 1245. Innocent
§- ¹³ 05³⁶· calls a Council in France, and therein condemns and excommunicates him, de·
9· 45· prives him of his Empire‚ and absolves his Subjects from their Oath of Fide-
lity‚ and by his A postolick Authority firmly and striffly forbids all Persons to
obey him any more as Emperor or King‚ and decrees that whosoever should
from henceforward yield him Counsel‚ or Aid, or Favour, as Emperor οι*
King‚ should be ipso fabio excommunicated ; and that the Electors of the Em-
pire rlnight freely proceed to the Choice of another Emperor, to succeed him inv,

Frederick, to purge himself of the Crime of Heresy, sent Letters to several·
Christian Princes, in which he defended himself against the Charge. He also
commanded the Archbishop of palemo, the Bishops of Pavia, Monte Cafflno,
and Cava, the Abbots of Casanova, Roland, and Nicholas a Predicant‚ diligently
to enquire and examine him concerning his Sentiments as to the System of Chri--
stian F aith, and other Articles and M ysteries of Religion. This being done,
and an Instrument drawn up, he appointed them his Procurators‚ that they
{hould make Oath before the Roman Pontiffi that Frederick having been exa-
mined, rightly agreed with all Christians in every Article of Faith‚ and was at
the farthest Distance from Heresy. They had a very unwelcome Reception‚
as being the Procurators of a Man expelled the Company of the F aithful‚ and2
for this VVickedness were said to deserve Punishment rather than Audience. But
when they affirmed themselves to be the Mess‘engers of a pure Christian Man,
the Affair was ordered to be examined by three Cardinals of the Roman Church,
who pronounced that Purgation trifling and void, inasmuch as they had noi
Authority to take his Examination. On this he commanded Frederick, that
if he would regularly purge himself, and submit toa right Examination, he

should repair to the Apostolick See, without the Noise and Terror of Argis(3
