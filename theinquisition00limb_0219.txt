scribe them. For the same Opinion, which in one Place appears extremely
erroneous3 in another, when 'tis more fully explained, and without Spite, is
harmless enough·, of which the single Instance of the Resurreffion of the
Dead is full Proof. For sometimes the Alhz'genfi’s are accused, that they
deny the Resurrefflion of human Bodie53 as tho’ they quite denied the Resurre-
&ion of the Dead 3 which yet in another Place is more distinffly explained
thus, that the Dead shall arise with spiritual Badies. And that their Opinions
have been misrepresented elsewhere, there can be no Doubt, and it will ap-
pear upon a Comparison of the several Places, wherein they are recorded.
But that the Opinione of the Albigenfi’s and Valdenses were very different, cannot
be denied. For if they had held the same, no Reason can be affigned, why
different ones should have been ascribed to them. One would rather be inclined
to believe, that as their Persecutors greedily fought after every Occafion to
punish them, they would have fastened on every one of them all the heretical
Opinions of the Valdenses and Albigenses ; that so being burdened with nume-
rous Crimes, the Inquifitors might seem to have the more just Pretence for
condemning thern.

For this very Cause it may be justly concluded, that many other of those im-
piousTenets that are ascribed by Barom'us, Bzovz'us, and otherS, to the Albigensbs
and Valdenses, were invented out of mere Hatred to them, and to render them
detestable to the People ·‚ especially that impious Opinion, which Eymericus
Direbi'. Inquifi Par. 2. Qaeſs 14. imputes to the Valdenses: That 'tis better to
fhtisfy α Man's Lust by (my Ab} of Uncleanness whatsoever, than to be perpetually
hurning·, and that (as they say and prainse) ’tis lawful in the dark for Men and
Wmen to lie promifiuoussy with one another, whensoever and as often as they have
the Inclination and Defire. For if this had been their Tenet, would there
not have been one of that vast Number of Prisoners, that they condemned
to such various Punishments, to be found, that was infected with it? Or, if
it could have been proved upon them, was the Equity, Humanity and Com·
passion of the Inquifitors so very great, as to have concealed a Crime, that:
would have been condemned by the common Voice of Mankind, and exposed
those that were guilty of it to the most severe Punishment and Death?
Would they, by such a Method of aiting, have given the World occasion
to censure them for persecuting, and cruelly punishing Men merely for the
Sake of holding Opinions different from the Roman Faith, tho' consistent
with a due Regard to a good Conscience, when at the same Time they might
have accused them of so horrid an Impiety? If they had been really such
execrable Persons, their Crimes ought to have been publickly exposed ; and
thus they themselves would have sunk under theWeight of Infamy, and their
Prosecutors would have been so far from being charged as bloody Inquifitors,
that they would have deserved the universal Applause.

Hence we may learn what Credit is to be given to Popish Writers, when
they give us an Account of the Opinions and Praffices of those they call

Hereticks. ’Tis their Way to charge all that separate from their Commu-

-nion with Impurity and Lust, as tho' the mill-y Cause of their leaving the Com-
