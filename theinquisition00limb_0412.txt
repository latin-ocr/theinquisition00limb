was imprisbned for Heresy‚ and accztsed as guilty of it, he cannot be abfhlved‚ unless
he judicially declares his Heresy. Let other Things be left to the Judgment and Con-

fiience of the Confiffm who ought to be instrufied that he may understand what is fit
to be done in fild) a Cause. Δ

1f the Criminal doth not ask for a Confeffor‚ and the Physician believes the
Distemper to ᾖε dangerous, he must be persuaded by all Means to confess;
and if he judicially satisfies the lnquifitors‚ he is to be reconciled to the
Church before he dies, and being absolved in Judgment, the Confeffor must
absolve him Sacra-mentally. This is ordered by the same Instruetion.

If ᾖε is well, and desii-es a Confeff0r‚ some are of Opinion he may not have
one granted him, unless he hath conieffedjudicially. Others think he may ;
and in this Case the Confeffor’s Bufiness is to exhort him to confess his Errors,
and to declare the whole Truth, as well of himselfas ofothers, as he is bound
dejure, to do. However, he must add, that he must not accuse himself or
others falsely, through Weariness os his Imprisonment, the Hope of.¹ a more
speedy Deliverance, ot Fear of Torments. Such a Criminal. the Confeffor
cannot absolve, before his Excommunication is first taken off, and he is-re-
conciled to the Chnrch„ But in Italy the Prisoners are more eafily allowed a
Confessor than in Spain.

They are particularly careful not to put two or more in the same Cell, un·
less the Inquisitor for any special Reason shall so order, that they may not
concert with one another to conceal the Truth, to make their Escape, or to
evade their Interrogatories. The principa] Reason indeed seems to be, that
through the Irksomeness of their Imprisonment, they may confess whatsoever
the inquilitors would have them. But if an Husband and his Wife are both
imprisoned for the same Offence, and there be no Fear that one should pre-
vent the othei· from making a free Confeffion of the Crime, they may be put
in the same Cell.

The Inquisitors are obliged to visit the Prisoners twice every Month, ancl

is? How he hatli his Health ? Whether he wants any Thing? Whether his
XVarder is civil to him ? i. e. Whether he speaks to him in a reproachful and
severe Manner? Whether he gives him his appointed Provifion, and clean
Linen ? and the like. These are exaffly the Sentences and Words they use in
these visits, to which they neither add any Thing‚ nor a& agreeable3 for
they use them only for Forms sake, and when the Inquisitor hath spoken
them, he immediately goes away, scarce staying for an Answer. And al-
though any one of the Prisoners complains* that he is not well used, ’tis of no
Advantage to him, nor is he better treated for the future. If there be Oc-
cafion or Neceffity, it will be convenient sor them to visit the Prisoners three or.
four times every Month, yea‚ as often as they think proper, viz. when the
Criininal bears with Impatience the Misfortune and Infamy of his Imprison-
ment, in such Case the Inquisitor must endeavour to comfort him very often,
not only by himself, but by others, and to tell him, that if he makes a free
Confeffion, his whole Affair shall be quickly and kindly ended. The
