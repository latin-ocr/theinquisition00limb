Efides these there are others, whose Crimes may be thought more prof
B perly to belong to another Court. But it sometimes happens thatthey
are said to be sprinkled with the Plague of Heresy‚ because they are suspected
of it, and therefore must be inquifited upon account of their Intention. A-
mongst these first occur those who read and retain Books prohibited upon ac-
count of Heresy. These are numbered amongst suspected Persons, and there
are severalsevere Edit-{s of the Roman Pontiffs against them.

Pius V. published a Bull upon the Festival of Caena Domini. In the first Compeg,

Chapter. are excommunicated all Hereticks and Shismaticks‚ of whatsoeverin lauch,-
Name or Se&‚ and all Favourers, Receivers, and Believers of Hereticks,“·34·
and those who any wise knowingly read, keep in their Houses, print, or in
any wise defend, for any Cause, publickly or privat-ely, under any Pretence
or Colour‚ and in* general all who defend their Books, without the Authority
of the Apostolick See. Pius IV. recalled all Licences of reading and keeping
such Books, by his Constitution‚ which begins, Cum pro munere, March 24.
1564. By these Letters he commands‚ that all Persons shall deliver and
confign over all condemned Books to the Inquifitors of the Cities where such
Books are. In like manner those who retain them cannot be excused, even
though they keep them locked up in a Chest, so that no one can see or read
them, because all such Excuses are cut off by this Sentence‚. and by the al-
ledged constitution of Pius IV. Again, those who print them are excommu0
nicated ·, and also those who in any wisc, or for any Cause, publickly or pri--
vately defend heretica] Books, &c. and the Absolution of all such Persons is
reserved to the Pope.

And that all manner of Leaveof reading even the least Thing in a Book §oasa A·
condemned for Heresy‚ may be eut off, they declare that they understandphor-Jn-
not only printed Books, but even Manuscripts and Parts of them, which qms. Ι· ¹·
