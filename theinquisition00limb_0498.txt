in every fitch Case they are to he condemned to Imprisonment. Thus also Guido
Fulcodius‚ in a certain Consultation, answerS. But if, which God forbid, such
should relapse, they are not to be received without a publick Penance, which is
elsewhere determined, unless it may pqffihly occafion any Scandal, and a greater Di-
vi ion, which we ought diligently to take Care of. But the Council of Narbonne,
cap. 11. thus determines. As to thofh, who, after their Ahjuration of Error and
Purgation, shall be found to have fallen again into the Heresy they have aljured, leave
them without further hearing to the secular Judgment, to receive their due Punzfh·
ment, fince ’tis enough that such have once deceived the Church by a false Converfion.
There is only this Difference, that if they repent, they are not denied the Sa-

en , eraments of Penance and the Eucharist. Cap. Super eo. de haeret. lib. 6. But

· · in Spain the Eucharist is generally denied to such Relapsed, upon account of
· 'the Danger which may happen by the Alteration which he receives, who is to

be delivered over to the secular Arm, and he is only allowed the Sacrament of
Penance. Hence they say, that relapsed Penirents are reincorporated into
the Church, which is done by the Sam-ament of Penance ς but that they are
not reconciled to ir, because the Sacrament of the Eucharist is necessary in
order to it. But if they do not repent, they are delivered over to the secular.
Court as obstinate Hereticks. But Simancas observeS, that there are some
“ who think that relapsed Hereticks may sometimes obtain Pard0n‚ viz. when
“ any one really relapsed, and not yet accused, nor convifted by any WitnesseS,
“ secretly accuses himself to the Inquifitors‚ voluntarily confeffes his Errors,
“ and with Tears asks Mercy, being ready to undergo any Penance, because
“ as to him there can't be that evil Suspicion, by which relapsed Persons are
“ presumed to be seignedly converted. But Simancas himself is of Opinion,
‘⁸ that this can’t be defended, unless it be helped out with a favourable Inter-
“ pretation, because the Judge is the Keeper and Minister of the Laws, and
“ not the Lord of them.'’ We must not omit here, that Pope Paul IV. Anno.

¹sons, that the Lord Jesus is not consubstantial to the Father and the Holy Ghosl ς or
that he was not conceivea' of the Holy Ghost 3 or that he did not undergo the Death
of the Croſs to reconcile us to the Father ·,- or that the Virgin Mary is not the true
Mother of God 3 or did not preserve her Virginity entire, viz. before, when, and
always after she brought him forth.

A Relapse into the Favouring of Heresy, is one who hath abjured such Fa-
vouring, and afterwards relapses into it, as the Council of Tarragone defines it..
But whether this is to be understood, if they relapse into the same F avouring,
or into any other, and whether both, or the former only, are to be delivered·
over to the secular Court, and punilhed with Death, the Laws do not clearly.v
determine. And therefore some think it the safest way, in such Case, to con-
sult the chief Pontiff, or the Senate of the general Roman Inquifition.

The Council of ‘Tholouse hath thus determinet} concerning Persons relapsed in-

to the Favouring of Heresy, as this Decree is extant in the Book, Concernz‘Zg¹
