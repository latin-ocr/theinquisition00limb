The His-rome qfthe INQU1s1r10N. 123

These Provincial Inquifitors give all of them an Account of their Provin-
cial Tribunal once every Year to the supreme Council, and especially of the
Causes that have been determined within that Year, and of the State and Num-
ber of their Prisoners in attual Custody. They give also every Month an Ac-
count o'f all Monies which they have received, either from the Revenues of the
Holy Office, or pecuniary Punilhments and Fines.

This Council meets every Day, except Holy-days, in the Palace-Royal,
on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in the Morning‚ and on Tuel'days, Thars-
days, and Saturdays after Vespers ε In these three last Days two Counsellors of
the supreme Council of vCastile meet with them, who are also Counsellors of the
supreme Council of *the Inquisition.

This Tribunal is now arisen to such an Height in Spain, that the King osi-522 §.12-
Castile, before his Coronation, subjeets himself and all his Dominions, by a
special Oath, to the most holy Tribunal of this most severe Inquisition.

This Office is not, as formerly, committed to the Predicant or Dominicanl’egna in
FriarS. They began to employ in it the secular Clergy, who were lkilsul in Dm&-
the Decrees and Laws, till at last the whole Power gradually devolved on them, ¹³1²* 3‘
so that now the Dominican F riars have no Part in it; tho' the Inquifitors often· amm' 3⁷⁴⁹
times use their Affistance, in judging of Propofitions, and they are employed
as Counsellors 'in the Holy Office.

The first Inquifitor General in the Kingdoms of Spain, was F riar Thomas Tur-
recremata, a Predicant, Prior of the Monastery of the Holy Cross at Segovia,
who was in high Esteem with their Majesties, as having often expiated their
Sins by Penance. Paramus relate-s, that he was created Inquifitor General of
the angdoms of Casilile and Leon by Sixtus IV. An, 148 3. and that the Pope
gave him Power by his Letters of making such Inquifitors as he thought pro-
per, and of recalling those who had been Inquifitors there before, and order-
ed him to make use of the new Method appointed in managing Causes ofthe
F aith, which was much more proper than the old one. Afterwards the same
Pope made the Provinces of Aragon, Valencia, Catalonia and Sicily, subje& to
the supreme Inquifitor of Castile and Leon, by his Bull, expedited the same
Year 148 3. This Bull Innocent VIII. who succeeded Sixtus in the Pontificate,
confirmed, as far as it related to Castile and Leon, An. 1485. and the next Year,
as it related to Aragon, Valencia, and Catalom’a. Alexander VI. did the same.²
Innocent's Bull runs thus:

Innocent Bzfhop, Servant of the Servants of God, to our belo-ved Son Thomas
Turrecremata, of the Order of Predz'cant Friars, and Profeffir of Divinity‚
Health and Apostolical Benedifi'ion. Sixtus IV. our Predeceffor of happy Affemory,
in order to extirpate the Herefies, which through the Instigatz'on of the great Enemy
of Mankind, had arisen in the Kingdoms of Castile, Leon, and Aragon, and
other Kinga'oms and Dominionssubjebl to our most dear Son in Christ, King ferdinand,
and to our most dear Daughter in Chrzst, Qeen Elizabeth, as we have been in-
formed, to our great Grief, by diverse Letters instituted and deputed Thee Inquisitor-
General of heretical Pravity, in all the Kingdems, Dominions, and Countries aforesaid,
