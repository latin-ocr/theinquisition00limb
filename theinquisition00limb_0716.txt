nothing appeared to them, whereby they couldDdefend the said Memory ac-
cording to Law, since from Mark Anthony’s own Confestim, they most clear-
ly fourd that he died a relapsed Heretick. But that they might proceed to
Sentence entirely, according to Law, they consulted with Divines and
skilsul Lawyers, and had the Matter proposed and carefully examined by
them. Atlength they all agreed that the same Punishments should be ex-
ecuted upon the Memory, Body, and Effeets of the Deceased, which would
have been executed upon himself had he been alive,

Having taken this Resolution‚ the twenty-first Day of December, An.
1624. was appointed for the pronouncing Sentence. Early in the Morning
os it, so vast a Multitude had got together to St. Mary supra Minervam, where
they generally give these religious Shews, that they were forced not only to
*shut up, but to guard the Gates with armed Men, and the great Area before
the Church was so prodigioussy thronged‚ that there was scarce Room for the
>Cardinals themselves to pass. The middle Isse of the Church, from the first
to the fourth Pillar was boarded in, with Boards above the Height of a tall
Man. At the upper and lower End ofit there were Gates‚ guarded by Swit·
zers. On each Side there were Scaffolds, running the whole Length of the
Inclosure, in which were Seats for the Cardinals and other Prelates‚ and other
ConveniencieS, to receive the Courtiers and other Noblemen standing or sit-
ting. On the right Hand coming in the sacred Council presided‚ on the left
Hand were placed the inferior Officers of the holy Inquifidon, the Governor
os the City and his Officials. Before the Pulpit was to be seen the Pisture of
Mark Avthony, drawn in Colours‚ covered with a black common Garment,
holding a Clergyman’s Cap in his Hand, with his Name, Surname, and
ArchiepiscopalDignity, which formerly he had born, inscribed upon it, to-

* gether with a wooden Chest bedaubed with Pitch, in which the dead Body
was inclosed. The rest of the Church was filled with Citizens‚ and a great
many ForeignerS, the Number of whom was at that Time larger, because
the Jubilee that was at hand had brought them from all Parrs to the City, that
they might be present at the opening the sacred Gates.

Things being thus disposed, a certain Parson mounted the Pulpit, and with
a shrill Voice, which rung thro’ all the Parts of the spacious Church, and in
the vulgar Language, that the common People might understand him, read
over a Summary of the Process, and the Sentence by which the Cardinals In-
quisitors General‚ specially deputed for the Affair by the Pope, pronounced
Mam} Ammoni, asa Relapse into Heresy, to have incurred all the Cen-sures
:sind Penalties' appointed to relapsed Hereticks by the sacred Canons, and Pa-
pal Constitutions, and declared him to be deprived of all HonourS, Preroga-
tiveS, and Ecclesiastical Dignities, condemned his Memory, and cast him
out os the chclefirstical Court, delivered over his dead Body and Effigies into
