 

The HtsToRY ofthe J'NQUISITION.

concerning sundry ThingS, εις, Whether they know such a one? As to the
Occafion and Time oftheir knowing him ? Concerning his Character? Whe-
ther they have seen, or heard him say, or do any Thing against the Faith

and what that- was? Where they saw him, how often, and who present? Iri·
what manner he said those Things, whether in Jest, or by way of Recital

or whether with a deliberate Minci, and by way of Affertion ? And finally:
whether they depose these Things thro’ Hatred or Rancour ἓ Or whether they
omit any Thing thro' Love or Favour? The Answers of the Witneffes to all
these Questions are taken down by the Notary. These Inter-rogatories ofthe

Witnesses may be ostentimes repeated at the Pleasure of the Inquifflors, that.

what was omitted in the former Interrogatories may be supplied.

How the PROCE ss begins by Denunciation.

’Ξέ

’ U T if the Accuser says, as is commonly the Case, that he will not ae* Eymen‘
B cnse, but denounce 3 and that he doth this thro' Fear of incurring the:P·3·92⁶⁶1¹—'·²*

Penalty of Excornmunication, ordered by the Inquifitor fordiscovering Thlngs
pertaining to the Faith within the prescribed Terin, then* the Inquisitor pre-
pares himself to make inquisition. And because this is the ordinary and most*
generally used Method of the Inquifition, I will describe it more largely and
diffinstly, that hereby the whole Method osmakin-glnquisltionmay be more·
sully understood.

When the Denouncer, who is also called the appearing Witness, comes tovegnaj
the Bishops or Inquifitors‚ before the Notary takes his Denunciation in a ju· Pmr. [²⁷5³

ridical Manner, heis usually asked, what he bath to propose? that they may ¹·

know, whether what he is determined to denounce belongs to the holy Office.
Because-sometimes Country ignorant People‚ or those who are troubled with
Scruples‚ bring such Matters before them, the Cognisance of which doth not
belong to the Inqulfitors. When they find that the Crime brought before
them is cognisable by the holy Office, they make the Denouncer {wear that
he will relate the Truth. After this the Notary receives the whole Denunci-
ation before the Bishop or¹ Inquifi'tor, or their Vicar, taking down the Denun-
ciation, or the Report of the ‘Denouncer in the first Person.. And that there
may no Doubt arise as to the Validity of the Oath, to spoil the Credit of the
Denunciation‚ as the Inquisitor doth not only take an Oath from the Denoun-
cer, or Witness voluntarily appearing‚ but also from the Witness who is cited,
upon the holy Scriptures touched with their Hmds, so 'tis farther requisite,
that the Notary should write at length, that such a one took his Oash tauchis-fg
the Scriptures‚ and not only write down, toztching with an &a that there may

be no Difficulty- in defending suchAets upton account of this Dese& Tho
