count of some greater or leffer Crime committed elsewhere, or by Reason of their
dwelling unde'r their Jurisdiblion, or for any of the aforesaid Causes. Por as the In-
quisttion is carried on, under God, in different Places, ana' by different Inquisitors,
’tis more wholesome andsafe, that every Criminal in the Place where he harh offended,
fhouldstand accountable to that Inquifitor wholly and only, by whom he was first bg-
gun with, for any of the aforesaid Causes, without Deceit, aad Datiger of the Affair
andos Souls. But so however, that the other anuisttors shall inquire out whatever
they can know concerning him, and write an Account hereos to those Inquifitors to
whom the said Criminal stands accountahle. For thus you fhall all fight as one Man,
and overcome.

But that such Escape may not go unpuniffied, in the Person who being in Pegna tn
*Custody for Heresy, breaks out of Jayl, 'tis a Matter of Custom rather than oft-eft.
Law, especially in Spain, that if he who makes his Escape‚ be of any confi-P· 3· com,
derable Reputation‚ and apprehended again, for Instance, a Nobleman‚ 35·
Doctor, religious Person, or otherwise a Citizen of Account, he shall be kept
in striaer Custody, and punished more severely. But if he is a mean Person,
he is publickly whipped, and his Cause is to remain, and be carried on in the
State it was before, but he is not to be treated for his Escape as one con-
victed of Heresy 3 because the breaking out of Jayl, or an Escape, hath no-
thing common with Heresy, and ’tis rather to be presumed that he fied be-
cause tired out with his Imprisonment‚ or thro' Fear offalse Witnesses‚ or the
Severity of his Torments, rather than from any Error of his Understanding.
However, Zanchinus says, thata Prisoner who escapes, or attempts to breakc.10.§ ς.
Prison, ought to be esteemed asa Comici, and condemned as an Heretick.
Simancas on the other hand says, this cannot be proved by common Lawuit 16
and tho' it be more plainly ordained by the royal Laws, yet in his Jfldg*§- „J
ment ’tis extreamly severe. 'Tis usual also with the Inquifitors, as soon ’
as ever they understand the Criminals have escaped, to write to the neigh-
bouring lnquifitors or Bishops, or other Persons whom they judge proper, to
find out whether the Person escaped hath fied to their City‚ that they may
take Care to apprehend him, adding in their Letter his Name, Surname,
Country‚ Stature, Colour, and other Circumstances, by which the fugitive
Criminal may be eafily known.

But ifsuch Fugitive shall be found guilty of Heresy, not only by Witnes-n.13e.
ses, but by his own Confestim, and hath declared himself ready to abjure it,
and yet escapes before his Abjuration, especially if he be a religious Person,
who bath himself preached HerefieS, he is cited personally to appear before
the Inquifitor at a certain Place, and within a certain Day, to abjure his He-
resy, and threatned with Excommunication unless he obeys. And if with an.
obstinate Mind he lies under the Sentence of Excommunication for a Year,
and doth not make his Abjuration‚ heis to be judged as an obstinate Here-
tick, and delivered over to the secular Court. If being thus cited they never-
theless refuse to appear, but suffer themselves to continue under Excomnmni--
cation, they are declared publickly to be excommunicated in all those

Churches and Places inwhich they have been cited, and all are commandied
