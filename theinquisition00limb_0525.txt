Miseries, they have often taken up Arrns, and endeavoured to affert their
Liberties. But having been subdued by most grievous Slaughters, they
have at length laid down their Fierceness, and are forced to bear the Yoke.
The Christians‚ partly through Fear of the Rage of the Jews, and partly
through an intemperate Zeal for Christianity‚ have endeavoured either whol-
ly to destroy by various Miseries this dispersed People, or to tire them out
by the Grievousness and Length of their Miseries, and thus to compel them
to profess the Christian Faith. Upon this account various Ediets have at
different Times proceeded against the Jews. Some have proscribed them in the
Countries where they have lived, others have deprived them of their Liber-
ties‚ and reduced them to Slavery ·‚ others have stripped them of those Ad-
vantages and Privileges which their other Subjects have enjoyed, that by
these Means they might at length be wholly extinguilhed‚ or wearied out
by the Miseries they endured for their Judoifin, renounce it, and embraee
the Christian Religion. Very severe Edicts have been made against them,
especially in Spain, where a very large Number of them dwelt, and were
thought to endanger the Safety of the Kingdorn.

In the Sixth Council of ‘Ioledo this Decree was published against the Jewsfiimancffit,
We the holy Cozmcil, with the Consent of the most Christian Princo, and his No-35- §.9-
bles, and most Illustriozts Persons, puhlish this Sentence, pleostng to Gon', that who-
soever shall enjoy the Kingdomfor Time to come, fhall not asce'nd the Royal Thione,
before he hoth promised upon the holy Sacraments, that he will suffer no Perfhns hut
Catholicks to dwell in his Kiszgdom. Andzf any one, after his Acceffion lo the King·
dom, shall rashly violate this Promifh‚ let him he Anathema Maranatha before the
eternal God, αηζῖ become Fewel for the everlast‘ing Fire, cmd also all fitch who agree
with him, Can. 3. Batonius, under the Year 638, says this was principally
decreed out of Hatred to the Jews, and bestows great Praises on it, and
fron] hence concludes, ''Tis not without Reoson that the Kings of Spain have had
the ‘fille of Catholick besto-wodan them, being worthy of so high a Title, because they
not only [wear that they will he Catholici& themselves, but that they will not fitffer
any one that is not a Catholick to d-:oell in their large Dominam.. But ηοῑΕ
withstanding this Decree, a great many Jews remained in Spain, and soon
encreased to such a Nuniber, that they began to appear formidable to the
Kings, andthey were accused, whether right or wrong, oi a Design to raise
a Rebellion. Upon which account another Edi& was made against them in
the Seventeenth Councll of Toledo, Can. 8. Since the Perfidioufizqfs of the Jews
harh not only defiled the Coot of sacred Christian Baptz'fhz which they hav? received,
but also attempted to conspire against the King and Kingdom ε let them he deorived of
all their Effeffis and lhffi’ perfidious Wretches themselves, their ers (md Chil-
dren, and the rest of their Posterity, throughout all the Provinces of Spain, hosob-
job? to perpetual Slovery, and romain every where dispersc'd3 and let fitch who
have made Slaves os them, by 720 Meam permit them to celebrate their Ceremonies‚
Yet still the Posterity of· the Jews greatly multiplied in Spain.

In the mean while the Romczmsts contend that the Jews ought not to be com-
pelled by Foree to embrace the Christian Religion against their Will,flpelcaule
