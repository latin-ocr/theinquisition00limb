paffive Vote, and of the F aculty of hearing any Persons Confeffions whatso-
eve{gravis a Paramo gives us another remarkable Instance of one Mary of the
Annuneiation, Prioress of the Monastery of the Annunciation at Lisbon, a

0· Maid of32 Years old, who had pretended that the Wounds of Christ, by the
’ special Grace and Privilege of God, were imprinted on her, and shewed 32

Wounds made on her Head‚ representing the Marks of those which were made
by our Saviour’s Crown of Thorns‚ and Blood sprinkled on her Hands like
a Rose, the Middle of which was like a Triangle‚ and shewed the Holes os the
Nails narrower on one Side than the other. The same were to be seen in her
Feet. Her Side appeared as tho’ it had been laid open by the Blow of a
Lance. When all these Things were openly fficwn, it was wonderful to see how
they raised the Admiration and Devotion of serious and holy Men, and withal
surprized and deceived them ; for she did not suffer those pretended Wounds>
to be seen otherwise than by Command of her Confeffor. And that absent
'Persons might have a great Veneration for her, she affirmed‚ that on ‘Thurs-
days she put into the Wounds a small Cloth, which received the Impreffion of
five Wounds in F orm osa Cross‚ that in the M iddle being the largest. Upon
which these Cloths were sent, with the greatest Veneration‚ thro’ the infinite
Devotion of the F aithful‚ to the Pope‚ and to almost all the most venerable
and religious Persons of the whole World. And as Paramus then had the Ad-
ministration of the Causes of F aith in the Kingdom of Sicily, he saw several of
those Cloths, and the Pifiure of that Woman drawn to the Life, and a Book
written by a Person os great Authority concerning her Life, Sannitity and
Miracles. Yea, Pope Gregory XIII. himself determined to write Letters to
that wretched Creature‚ to exhort her thereby tov perfist with Constancy in her

ffid, t. 3,Course, and to perse& what she had begun. At last the Imposture was

and Credit enough, by her pretended Sanctity, to recover the Kingdom of
Portugal to its former State, which. had legally fallen under the Power ofPhi‘-

Inquifitors os Lisb0n‚ Decemb. 8. An. 1588. F irst‚ she was commanded to pass
the rest of her Life shut up in a Convent of another Order, that was affigned
to her, without the City of Lisbon. Likewise, that from the Day of proe-
