The HisTORY ofthe INQtJlsITION.

«ι But if this Condition should be approv’d by the Pope, the Inquifitors
‘⁴ may proceed against Hereticks giving Scandal, and punish thern according
“ to the Nature of it. And first, he says 'tis probable, that the Inquisitors

“ Because the Condition ceases by the Offence, and the Obstruction is remov’d,
“ and the foresaid Hereticks remain within the Bounds of the Law. But that
“ the Inquifitors may proceed thus far, they ought fully to prove that Here-
“ ticks have given Scandal 3 fince the giving this is the Condition that confers
‘⁶ jurisdiction. He thinks it however more probable, that when the Scandal is
“ prov’d‚ the Inquisitors can punish such Hereticks only for Scandal, and not
‘⁸ for Heresy ·, because this seems to be excepted by Virtue of the Condition
‘·‘ which the Pope hath approved. So that the Offence of Scandal gives no
.“ Jurisdiffion over any other Offence that is excepted.

“ As to Scandal, he saith, That any one who gives it, not only in Spain,
‘⁶ but to any Catholick on the Spanish Sea, may be punished as well as if he
“ had given it by Land3 but not if it was given in his own Country, or
“ elsewhere without the Bounds of Spain.

“ But if any of the aforesaid Hereticks shall be accused to the Inquifitors for
“ any foreign heretical Act, before such Treaty of Commerce, and after-
“ 'wards comes· to Spain, notwithstanding such Treaty‚ he may beapprehend-
“· ed, and obliged to receive the Faith. For the Inquifflors, i by the preceed-
“ ing Denunc-iation, have acquired a Power against such Hereticks, which
“ Power is not taken away by the Treaty of Commerce, If any one removes
“ his Dwelling from Spain into England, to escape -the Judgment of the Inqui..
“ fitors, althouthhe should not be accused before, but after the Treaty‚ of
‘³‘ an heretica] A& committed before it, he cannot enjoy anyBenefflby it,-
“ because he ought not to be countenanced in his F raud.

“ As to the Sorts of Scandal for which such an Heretick may be punilh’d‚
“ they are these, viz. If by Reasons‚ Persuafions, or any other Way, he en-
“deavours to persuade any: Catholick to embrace his Sest, or any Error
“ against the Faith, or to turn him afide from the Catholick Dostrine 01·

“· Purity of Faith 3 if he profanesnthe, Sacraments‚ or doth any Injury to -

‘⁶ thern, or to holy Images‚ if he doth not rise in Presence of the Host, or
“> covers his Head before it, with other Things of the like Nature.

“ The Punishrnent ofsuch Persons upon these Accounts is arbitrary, greater
“· or less, according to the Nature ofthe Scandal. Ifit be very heinous, they
⁴¹· may befturned over tothe secular Com-r. They may not be forced to
‘⁶ make that Abjnrarion, which, according to Law, is enjoyn'd to Hereticks
“ or suspected Persons; because even suspected Persons are not judged for He-
“ resy only, nor do they return to the Catholici< Faith. But they· may be
“ obliged to swear, that as long as they remain in that Kingdom, or ⁴in any

“ Places subject to it, they will not commit anyFault whatsoever against
{Rure Catholici< Faith⁸
