whatsoever.
They may compe] any Witness‚ even tho' a Person of Distinstion, to ap-
pear before them, and to give Evidence in a Cause of the Catholick Faith. But
this is so explained by Campegius‚ ‘⁶ As that t'ne Inquifitor can only compelzn Zanch
“ the Witness to give his Evidence, when it doth not expose him to any ‘al’- ¹3=d
‘⁶ imminent Danger 3 if it doth, he cannot be compelled. The Judge may
“ also force them to appear, by forming a Process against them, that they
‘⁶ refuse to appear and bear Witness‚ because corrupted by the Criminal
“ with Money, which obliges them to be forth coming, least they should
“ be falsely condemned. Ifany refuse to appear, the Judge may cite them,
“ and proceed against them3 and if they dont’t then appear, he will treat
“ them as actually corrupted. He may farther punish them for Contumacy
‘⁶ with Confiscation oftheir Effe&s.'' These are the different Opinions of the
Doctors, as alledged by Campegius.

Befides this the Inquifitors may compe] the Witneffes to give Evidence‚ by Caren.
threatning thern'with a Fine, or taking Pledges from them, by Excommuni-pzwt· 3-
cation and Torture. Carena tells us, that in the supream Inquifition at Rome, a m· 7· .-
certain Person was forced by Torture to take the Oath which he refused·⁵ §- Ι· '³‘ ‘⁸

If the Advocates or Notaries give any Affistance or Help to Hereticks,
or their F avourers, the Inquifitors must proceed against them. Since a special In- Direff.

They have Power also to command those who have Proceffes, or anycap.trc
other Instrumenta drawn against Hereticks‚ to deliver them to them. We grantwmmffi
you also the Power of causing all Persons to deliver to you the Books, or Registers, ff* ‘³⁴³
