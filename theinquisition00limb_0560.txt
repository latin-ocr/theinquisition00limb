How the Process begins by way qf I N QJ 1 s 1 T10N.

H E N the Process is made by Inquifition, he who goes to the Inquisi-
tor sayS‚ that he doth not appear as an Accuser or Denouncer, but
only relates to him that there is such a Report, and that it hath frequently
come to the Ears of the Inquifitor from grave and reputable Persons, that
sucha one hath done or said some Things against the Faith, and the publick
Report plainly discovers the common Infinuation. And by this Means the
Process is carried on.
Direff. Then the Inquisltor causes certain Witneffes to be cited, especially grave and
μς. 2:.79.reputable Persons, and in the Presence osa Notary, and two Religious, or
otherwise reputable Persons, inquires of them only concerning the Report.
Whether 'tis the common Report of such a one, that he did or said such Things
against the Faith? How they know there was such a Report? How long
such Report hath been ? Whether they know such Person to be defamed?
Whether they know whence the Report arose? Whether from ill disposed
Persons or others? And the like.
This is the Command of Innocent, Cap. Qalz'ter ΕΞ quando, de Accusat..
Hence we may gather how Infamy is proved. For the Witness must say,
that the Person under Confideration is defamed of such a Crime. And when
'tis inquired of him, in whose Account heis infamous, he must answer with
such and such3 and unless he affigns them, he doth not appear to give a good
Reason of what he says. Befides, it can’t be known whether they are serious.
or ill disposed People.
anusde When the Report is thus proved, the Inquifitor proceeds to inquire out
kaeret. the Truth of the Affair. For this Purpose he causes the Witneffes to be ci·

§- ¹0⁸ other reputable Men, and zealous sor the Faith3 and after glvmg them
their Oath, he inquires of them, not concerning the Report, but the Thing
it sels, in Presence os the Notaries‚ and two religious or reputable PersonS.
After this he proceeds to draw out a Confeffion from the Criminal himseffi
And first he goes to the Place of the Inquisitiom where, when the Crimi-
nal appears before him, he tells him that heis excited and moved by the
Fame and frequent Reports, that he the Criminal appearing and standing
before him, hath taught, written, or publickly declared certain Things
against the Truth of the Catholick Faith, or that he hath believed and fa·-
voured such who teach these Things, or received or defended them. Thac
therefore he, according to his Office, cannot diffemble that there is such a.
Report·‚ however, that he will not condemn him, till these Crimes are legal·-
ly and plainly p10ved before him.
