himself never, as 1 can find, bath attempted to clear up these strong Circum*
stances, though he owed it to himself and his Friends‚ 1 think he can’t well
be excused from prastising the Death of Servetus at Vienne, and lending his
Affistance to the bloody Papists of that Place the more effestually to procure
his Condemnation.

But he had the good Fortune to make his Escape from imprisonment,
and was, June 17, 1553. condemned for Contumacy, {and burnt in Effigie
by the Order of his Judges, having himself got saie to Geneva, where
he was re-condemned, and a&ually burnt in Person, OHober 27. of the same
Year, 1553· He had not been long in this City before Calvin spirited up one
Nicholas (le la Fountain, probably one of his Pupils‚ to make Information
against him, wisely avoiding it himself, because, according to the Laws of
Ges-leva, the Acculer must submit to imprisonment with the Party he accuses,
till the Crime appears to have a solid Foundation and Proof. Upon this In-
formation Set-velus was apprehended and imprisoned. Calvin ingenuoussy
owns²³, That this whole Afi'air was carried on at his Instance and Advice;
and that, in order to bring Sei-vetus to Reason, he himself found out the Party
to accuse him, and begin the Process against him. And therefore, though,
as the forementioned Author of the Bibliotheque for Jan. &a 1729. ob-
serves, the Aetion after its Commencement was carried on according to the
Course of Law ·‚ yet, as Calvin accused him for Heresy, got him imprison’d‚
and began the criminal Process against him, he is answerable for all the Con·
sequences of his Trial, and was in reality the first and principa] Author of his
Death, especially as the pena} Laws against Hereticks seem at that Time to
have been in force at Geneva, so that Servetus could not escape the Fire upon his
Conviffition of Heresy,

When he was in Gaol he was treated with the same Rigor as if he had been
detained in one of the Prisons of the Inquisition. He was stripped of all Means of
procuring himself the Conveniencies and Supplies he needed in his Confinement,
They took from him ninety seven Pieces of Gold, a gold Chain worth twenty
Crowns, six gold Rings, and at last put him into a deep Dunge0n‚ where he
was almost caten up with Vermin. All this Cruelty was praestised upon a Pro-
rcstant‚ in the Protestant City of Geneva. Resides this, he could never get a.
l'roftor or Advocate to affist him, or help him in pleading his Cause, though
he requested it, as being a Stranger‚ and ignorant of the Laws and Customs
ofthe Country. Calvin, at the Request of the Judges, drew up certain Pro-
pofitions out of Servetus's BookS, representing them as blasphemous, full of
Errors, and prophane Reveries, all repugnant to the Word of God, and to ⁷„
the common Consent of the whole Church; and, indeed, appears to have
been acquainted with, and consulted in the whole ProcesS, and to have used
all his Arts and Endeavours to prevent his coming off with Impunity.
