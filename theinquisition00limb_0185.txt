fine all Places and Cities were filled with Terrors and Tmnults 3 for Violence was
offered to the Bishops‚ and the Judges fizw the Monrnings and Sighs of the People‚

And at length, after a tragical Account of the various Cruelties and Perse-
cutions of the Arium, he adds: Thac they would not suffer lhe Friends of those they p. 859,
had stain, to bury their dead Bodies, but hid them z'n private Places, that herebv they

might conceal tffiz‘r Murthers. There are other Paffages to the same Purpose in

the same E i e.

In his firi} Apology also for his ssight, he speaks to the same Purpose‚
and among other Things rel-ates, that Sebastianus, Captain of the Forces‚ at
‚the Instigation of George the Bishop, ordered Virgins to be brought to cz flasnz‘ng 2704·
Pile, and violently compelled them by Fire to declnre their Profeffion of the Arian
Fnz'th3 and when he perceived their Cournge was not to be thus subdam, he

stripped their Bodies nnked‚ and so mnngled their Faces with Bhws, that it was

i a [mg while before their own Relations knew them- again. He also apprehended
forty Men, and misernbly tore their Bodies by a new Methocl of Cruelty3 for he
made Rods of the Palm ‘T ree, retaining their Prickles‚ and with these beat them
on their Baelo, in such a barbarous manner, that some, by Recison of the Prickles
sticking in their Flefh‚ were forced several Times to apply to the Phystcinns for a

Cure3 whilst others afft'nczlly dy'd under the Torture, As for the others‚ as many

as they apprehended‚ they bnnzfhed thern, with the Virgini, into Great Hoafis, n

Countr in E t.

Andy that gtyffgy might have some Pretext to palliate their Persecutions, ΙὶὂΛίΑ
γὶἑῗον, in his Acconnt of the Persecutions of the Vandals‚ tells us, that the
very Laws made by the Catholicks against heretical Impiety, were now
turned, and executed upon the Catholicks themselves 3 so that what they
once suffered from the CatholickS‚ they made the Catholicks to suffer in their
Turn, now they had got the secular Power on their Side.

CatholickS, laid waste the Monasteries and Caves of the Monks. Almost the
fame Things are related of Severus, Bishop of Antioch. Vifior in his first Book
of the Vandal Persecution, says, that being inseeted with the Arinn Heresy,
they filled every Place with Fire and Slaughter‚ and burnt and demoliffied
the Churches, Temples, and Monasteries3 and tortured the Bishops and
Priests with various kinds of Cruelties, to force them to deliver up all the
Gold and Silver they had of their own, or that belonged to their Churches 3
andif they gave thern any, they put them to yet more exquifite Tortures
to force them to deliver up the whole, as imagining they had concealed a Part
from them. They deprived the Catholicks up and down of their Churche3‚
and commanded them to be shut up. The same Vmor recounts the vari-c·62§-6·
