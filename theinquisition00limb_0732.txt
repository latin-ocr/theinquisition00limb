An Emtmeratz'on of the several Instances qs Injzssice and C‘ruelty
prcffli ed in the Trihunal os the IN Qu 1 s 1 T 1 o N.

r H US far we have described the Method of Proceeding observed in

the Inquisition, as far as we could learn it from the Writings of the Pa-
pists, and even the Inquifitors themselves·‚ and if we attentively confider it,
and compare it with the usual Method of Proceeding in all other Courts‚ we
ssmll find it to be a Series and Connection of Injustice and Cruelties, and
subversive of all Laws both divine and humane.

The Papists usually recommend to their own People this Tribunal as an ho—
ly one, and call the Inquisition the holy Office. But if we confider it through-
ly, we shall find 'tis all Disguise, by which they endeavour to palliate and
cover over the Villany and Injustice of this Court. lwill not now undertake
to shew that the Caufes which are managed before this Tribunal‚ are not sub·

jecit to humane Judgment‚ but belong to the Tribunal of God and his Son

Christ. For God only, the supream Lord of all, who can save, and can
destroy, can prescribe the Laws of Salvation and Damnation. He only,
as Omniscient and Searcher of Hearts‚ can pronounce an infallible Judgrnent
of every one’s Faith, which lies concealed in his Minci, and which he may
diffemble by VVords or Actions, and hath admitted no Man as Partner with
himself in this Power, From hence it evidently follows, that 'tis a sacrile-
gious Violation of the divine Majesty and Laws, in that the Pope of Rome ar-
rogates to himself the Judgment of the Faith‚ prescribes Laws of Be·
lieving to the Faithful, erects the Tribunal of an Inquifition, sends every
where lnquifitors as Judges delegated by him, who, in his Name, and by a
Power granted by him, are to inquire into the Faith of all, and punish those
who are not in all Things obedient to the Pope. Nor will I here examine
that villanous Doctrine by which they teach, that Hereticks are to be de-
prived ol all Power, so that Faith is not to be kept with them, Subjeffils are
not bound by their Oath of Allegiance and Fidelity, that the Husband or
Wife, for the Heresy of either, is freed from the Laws of Matrimony‚ and
even Children from Obedience to their Parents. For ’tis fully evident that
this Do& rine subverts all Laws divine and humane.

Ι will only in a few Words represent the principal Iniquities and Instances
of Injustice ofthis Tribunal, in which, as to the Reason and Method of Pro-

-ceeding in Favour of the Faith, it differs from the Laws and Customs of all

other Court33 whereby Things evidently unjust in other Tribunals, are in
<this accounted just. 1 shall not indeed mention all, but the Chief only, and
most remarkable Instances, as Specimens of the rest.
