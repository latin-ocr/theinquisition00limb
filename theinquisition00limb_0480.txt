The H1s10mr of the INQu1s1-r10-N4

They are said indirectly to obstruet, who use any Infinuation or other

Means, from whence consequentially any Impediment may arise to the Of-
fice of the Inquisition. Such for Example, who order that no one shall bear
Arms, unless of the Houssiold of the tempor-al Lord, and that no one shall ap-
prehend, or cause to be apprehended any Person, but the <temporal‘ Lord.
For from thence it follows, that those who belong to the Inquisitors can’t wear
Arms, nor take up any Person. The-se are less criminal than the former;
but are all excommunicated3 and if they lie under that Excommunication
for a whole Year, they must, in order to their Reconciliation, abjure such
Impediment and Favouring, otherwise they are delivered over as impenitent
Hereticks to the secular Arm.
- The Power of proceeding against such Persons, was given to the Inquisi-
tors by Urba-2 IV. and other Popes, in a Rescript to the Inquisitors of here-
tica] Pravity, beginn'ng, Prae cmfflis, where, amongst other Things, there
are these. But if, what we do nat believe, there should happen to be any, of what

Nor are there wanting Examples of an Inquifition actually made, not only
against private persons, but allo against Magistrates, yea, whole Cities and
Coinmunities, on the Account of creir hindring the inquisition. Bzovius
relates a memorable Instance, which happened in the Territory of Parma„
about the Yenr 1385. from a Letter of Honorius IV. brought to the
‘335029 of Parma, in which there are these Things. ‘⁶ Friar Florius a Pre—
ἰι uiant, inquisitor of heretica] Pravity in the Parts of Lombardy, deputed..
ὃ( by the Apostolick See, condemned a certain Woman, relapsed into Here--
‘⁶ sy, after Abjuration, who being delivered to the secular Court, was burnt.
²⁶ But some Persons, who were met together in the Place where the said„
εἰ W'oman was burnt, and a great Number os others, who flocked from the
“ different Parts of the City, ran in a violent Manner to the Place of the
“ Friars of the said Order, and forcibly enter'd the said Place, and broke
ἐς· open the Church Doors, destroyed the Houses with Stones, and presumed·
³⁶ to enter by Violence the little Chapels of the said szce, and unjustly plun-ff*
⁴⁶ dered the said Friars of their Books, Garments and Effe&s‚ and beat and
*Β woundcd several os them, one of whom, after a few Days, died of the·
⁴¹ Wounds he had received; so that the Friars were forced to leave the Place.

⁴< And because the Governor and Magistrate neglected to proceed to the—

“ Punishment of that Crime‚ according to their Office, they were cited by

⁴⁶ the ssishop of Ostia personally to appear before him at a certain Place and

⁵⁶ Time. They appeared3 but because there was no proper Syndick for

ἐξ the aforesaid Community‚' who appeared before him, according [(Ιέ the
