xii PREFACE.

Testimony of their omn Writers, of those villanam Frauds and*¹
Cruelties‚ ‘with which they are charged. In a ‘Letter to Mr.
Limborch himself, he tells him, that he had so fulgy exposed·
their secret Arts of Wcleedness and Cruelty‚ that, if they had
any Remairts of Humanity in them, the'y must be afhamed of
that horrid Tribunal, in which every Thing that· mets just and
righteows mass so monstrously perverted 3 and that ’tmcos fit to be
translated into the vulgar Language of every Notion, that the
mecinest People might understand the Antiaechrzstian Praetices of
that execrable Court. The Papzsts wereso apprehenfive os the
‘Prejudices that might arise to their Conse hy the ‘Publication of
this Book, that the (lammah, Inquifitors General at Rome, con-
dema’d it by aaz Eda‘l, and sorbad the reading it, under the sea
verest Penalties.

Mr. Lock often mentions, in his Letters7 several Additions
which Mr. Limborch had prepared, and promised to transmit
to him, that he might irffert them in their proper ‘Places in the
Margin. I know ποῖ whether he ever had the Pleasure ofseeing
them 3 ’tis certain the Publick hath never hitherto been fizvour’d
with them. W hen Ι first began my Translation os the History,
the late ingeniove Anthony CoUim, Es& informed me, that he
had some Μ, S. ‘Papers of Mr. Limborch relating to it, and

generoufly sent them to mesor my Perusal. After this, I mas
informed by a morth) friend, that there meos a Gentleman in

Holland who had a large Number of Corra-<stiam and Additions 3
and, upon my Application to him, he very kindly ordered them
to be transcribed out of the Copy Mr. Limborch kept by him,
which he had corree‘i'ed and enlarged with hee omn Ησιηαῖ,μ
and transmitted them to me from the Hague. His Name is
Francis a Limborch‚ a morthy Relation of the learned Author’s
to whom I take this Opportunity of returning my fincere Thank}
