fible, as notso much as to think ofczppeafing the Divine Anger, but that, like Atheiffl,
they thought the Worla' destitute cf any providentia! Government and Care, and thus
added one Crime to another 3 that the Bifhofs tlvenrfhlves had thro-2271 off all Care of

tyrannically used their Power. This was the deplorable Sta-te of the Christian
Chumb, which God, as Eusebius well observes, first punished with a gentle
Hand3 bnt when they grew harden’d and incurable in their Vices‚ he was
pleased tolet in the most grievous Persecutions upon them, under Dioclefinn,
which exceeded in Severity and Length all that had been before.
From these Accounts it evidently appears, that the Christian World alone is
i not chargeable with the Guilt of Pexsecution on the Score of Religen. 'Twas
³ praftised long before Christianity was in being, and first taught the Christians
by the persecuting Heathens. The most eminent Philosophers espoused and
ἸΙ vindicated persecuting principles and Emperors, otherwise excellent and
i good, made no scruple of destroying Multitudes on a religious Account, such
as Trajan, and Aurelius Verus. And Ι think I may farther add ‚ that
the Method of propagatim-g Religion by Cruelty and Deam, owes its Inven-
tion to Lay Pola-y and Craft3 and that how servilely scever the Priesthood
hath thought fit to imitate them, yet that they have never exceeded them
in Rigour and Severissy. Ι can trace out the Footsteps but of very few Priests
in the foregoing Accounts ς nor havet ever heard of more exceffive Cruelties
than those prafitised by Antiochus, the Egyptian Heretick Eaters, and the Ro..
man‘Emperors. Ι 'may farther add on this important Article‚ that ’tis the
Laity who have put it into the Power of the Priests to persecute, and rendered
j it worth their while to do it ·, they have done it by the Authority of the civil
² Laws, as well as employed Lay Hands to execute the Drudgery ofit. The ‡
Emoluments of Honours and Riches that have been annexed to the favourite
Religion and Priesthood is the Establiffiment of civil Society‚ whereby Re-
ligion hath been made extremely profitable, and the Gaius of Godliness
worth contending for. Had the Laity been more sparing in their Graue, and
their civil Constitutions formed upon the generous and equitable Principle of
an universal Toleration, Persecution had never been heard of ainongst Men,
The Priests would have wanted not only the Power but the Inclination to per-
secute ·, fince few Persons have such an Attachrnent either totwhat they account
