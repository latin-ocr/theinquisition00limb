their Names. And moreover‚ by such sort of Proofs they may be proceeded against
without the Confeffions of any others of them.

Foiu‘tln'y, Concerning the Synagogue ’tis enquimd, What must be done with fitch
a one, πείθει-εἰη, by the Helio, tht and Counsel of the Jews who dwellbin the
Country, any Christians have been washed hy the Jews, to the Prejudice of hoty
Baptista, and have denied the Faith hy their Persuafions. T hose of Padua answer,
that it mun needs be entirely destroyed, or deprived of the Privileges of Christ‘ians,
which Sentencc¹ is approved hy those of Boiogna and F errara. ’ v

As to a Peison who offena's in the said Cases within the Bounds of the Inquisttion,
‘where he lives, and hath an House within the said Bounds, in which he has been
u L‘d to dwell with his family ⁰, those of Padua say, 'tis fiifficient, that an Edic‘tz of
Citaiion he sent to the said House, if the Person hath transported himself to foreign
and unknown Parts ς ancl if he doth not appear within the proper Terms affloned him,
he must be proceeded against, and his Effeets found therein he diſjoosed of> according
to Law.

In another Inflance the Paduans answer thus ·, ‘That an Infant Child of a bap·-
tized Jew, l⁶fl <with its Moiher', who continues in Jewish Blindness, must, whitst
the luithm- is alnent in remote and unknown Parts, be taken from her in Favour of
the Fauo, hythe Church or Ordinary of the Place‚ or the Christian Prince‚ to
whofi’ Government 'tis ficbjebt, and brought up among st faithful and unfitspebi‘ed Peo-
ple, and baptized, unless the Child it self appears to he against it.

As to another Instance, of a certain Person, against whom it was proved by Je-
verat legal IVMmffis, that being in a Jewiss] Synagogue‚ and about to read the Law
folemnly before other Jews, according to their Manner, it was objec‘ted to him by one
present, that he was not worthy to read the Law, for that in such a Country he had
been baptized 3 and he himself owned and confeffled that he had been there baptized,
hut that he was returned to Judaism‚ and had performed the Penance which the
Jews had appointed him for his Sin in being baptized‚ and that he would live and die
from henceforwards as a Jew 3 those of Padua and Bologna say, that the ‘Truth
concerning these Things may be extorted from him hy Punishments not reaching
to the Effifston of Blood‚ by the secular Judge‚ at the Conzmand of the Inquifitors.

As to two other Persons, viz. a Man and a Wman, who declare themselves, and
att publickly as Jews, and yet it may be legally proved against them by theſjes,
that the Parents of each were Chrzstians, and they themselves were baptized, viz.
in this Manner. For the Fatherof this Man, who declares himself, and aas as a

Jew, was himself first a Jew, but afterwards baptized‚ and st) made a Christian,
ard mari-iat a Christian IVoman for his IVife‚ hy whom he had this Son, and caused
han to oc bsthed, so that he „bl-ved many Y ears as a Christian. A long while after
his Father r urned to Judaism‚ and caused this Son, of whom we speak, to be cir-
mammisea, so that he afterwards always lived as a Jew, and what is more, caused

ι his jutraha, who was truly a Christian, to Judaise, who was at length buried in

the Bis ia? Place of the Jews. And as to the Woman who puhlickly declares herself,
and atis as a chesS‚ she also is proved to have been first a Christian after the
afhrcy'assd Manner. For her Mother was first known to be a Jewess, but was after·
wards made a Christian, and married a Christian Man, upon whose Death fhe re-
