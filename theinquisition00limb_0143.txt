1 have' thrown all these excellent passages of the sacred Writings together,
that it may appear in the most convincing Light, that the Scriptures have no-
thing in thern ro countenance the Spirit, or any of the Methods of Persecu-
tion and to confront the melancholy Account I have given before of the
Progress and Ravages caused'by this accursed Evil. Good God, how have
the Prafflces of Christians diflered from the Precepts of Christianity l W'ould
one imagine that the Authors of those dreadful Mischiefs and Confusions were
the Bishops and Ministers of the Christian Church? That they had ever
read the Records of Christian Religion? Or if they had, that they ever be-
lieved them?

But it may be objeeced, that whatever may be the Precepts of the Christian
Religion, yet the Condu& even of the Apostles themselves gives some Coun-
tenance to the Spirit and Prafflce of Persecution, and particularly the Con-
du& of St. ‘Paul ; and that such Powers are given to the Guides and Bisnops
of the Christian Church‚ as do either expressy or virtually include in them a
a Right to persecute. Let us briefly examine each ofthese Pretenssons.

As to the Praffice of the Apostles, Beza mentions two Instances to vindi-De Heret.

struck dead by Peter; and the other that ofElymas the Sorcerer, struck blind ΡΜ· Ρ·
by Paul. But how impertinently are both these Instances alledged ? Heresy16¹> fac.
was not the Thing punistied in either of thern. Ananias and sapphira were
struck dead for Hypocrisy and Lying, and for conspiring, if it were poffible,
to deceive God. Elymas was aJewzfh Sorcerer, and false Prophet‚ a subtle
mischievous Fellow, an Enemy to Righteousness and Virtue, who withstood
the Apostolick Authority‚ and endeavoured, by his Fratid5‚ to prevent the
Conversion of the Deputy to the Christian Faith. The two first of these Per-⁵
sons were punished with Death. By whom? What, by Peter? No, by the·
immediate Hand of God, Peter gave them a Reproof suitable to their Wie-
kedness; but as to the Punishment, he was only the Mouth of God in de-
claring it, even of that God who knew the Hypocrisy of their HeartS‚ and
gave this fignal Instance of his Abhorrence of it in the Infancy of the Chri-
stian Church, greatly to discourage‚ and, if poffible, for the future, to pre==--
vent Mens thus dealing fraudulently and infincerely with God. And,
Ipresume, if God hath a Right to punish Frauds and Cheats in another
WorId, he hath a Right to do so in thi83 especially in the Instance before
us, which seems to have something very peculiar in it. Peter expressv says
to Sapphira‚ How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Ag„ v. ς,
'What can this tempting of the Spirit of the Lord be, but an Agreement be- ’
tween Ananias and his Wife, to put this Fraud on the Apostle‚ to see whe-
ther ω’ no he could discover it by the spirit he pretended to? This was a pro-
'perChallenge to the Spirit of God, which the Apostles were endewed with,
and a Combination to put the Apostolick Chara&er to the Trial. Had not
the Cheat been discovered, the Apostle’s Inspiration and Miffion would have
been deservedly questioned, and as the State of Christianity required that
this divine Miffion ssiould be abundantly established, Peter letsthem know thatv
