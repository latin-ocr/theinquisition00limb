 

The H1sronr ofthe lNQUISITloN. 21

vants are ipfhfablo, freed from Servitude, and every Instance of Duty, the
Moment their Master falls into Heresy. In Spain, if the Slaves are Believers‚
'or profess the Christian Religion, when their Master falls into Heresy, they
recover their Freedom, according to the Seville Instrubi‘ion, An. 1484. cap. 24,
Oztr Lords the King [md Qzeen, out of their Goocimss and C lemencv, will and Ordaia,
that the Servants of all Hereticks shall be made free, provided that'if whilst they lived
with them they were Christians. But if they had not profeffed the Christian Re-
ligion, they are forfeited with the other Effecis. And tho' such Slaves should
have been made free by their Masters, yet if it was after their becoming He-
teticks, 'tis for that Reason null and void.

Subjefts, when the Prince or Magistrate is an Heretick, are freed from
theirObedience. Thus it hath often happened, that Kings pronounced He-
reticks by the Pope, have, with all their Posterity, been deprived of all their
Dignities, jurisdictions and Rights, their Subje&s absolved from their Oaths
ofAllegiance and Fidelity, and their Dominions given as a Prey to others.

And finally, they are deprived osthat Power, which is introduced by the
Law ofNations‚whereby they lose all Property in every Thing they have. Cap.

sy. Cap. a‘hsslutos, de haeret. Let all know that they arefreedfi'om the Debt of Fide-
lizy, Dominion. and all Ser-vice, to mam'fcjs} Hereticks, how strong soever the Obligations
may be which they meander. These Things are thus inferred : ‘⁶ First, ifan §imaum
“ Heretick deposites any of his Effeets with any Person, such Person is not ἶ· 4⁶·
“ obliged to restore them to the Heretick‚ after his Heresy is manifest, but9‘ 73·
“ to the Treasury. Farther‚ a Catholick Wife is not obliged to any Du-
“ ty. to her heretical Husband, because by the Husband's Heresy she is freed
“ from her Duty. In like manner a Catholici< Husband is freed from all Du-
“ ty to his wife, if she be an Heretick. Nevertheless they can't marry with
“ others, because the Band ofMatrimony is not dissolved. An Husband canyc Rovas,p.:.
“ be forced to cohabit with his Wife if she is fallen into Heresy, even tho⁵Aſjbrt.4o.
“ {he is reconciled ·, nor is he bound to maintain her, because her Dowry is ᾗ· 3⁶5⁸
“ confiscated by Heresy·‚ and as she is stripped of her Dowry by her own
‘⁹ Fault, the Hulband is not obliged to maintain an unindowed Wifc. Zau-c, 18,‹5‚2.
“’ chinus Ugolinus explains this Matter more largely. The very Children,
‘³ Brothers and Sisters of Hereticks, ought to forsake them. Yea, the very
“ Band of Matrimony with such is dissolved. For if any one departs from the
“ Orthodox Faith‚ and falls into Heresy, his Wife is not obliged to cohabit
“ with him, but may seek to be separated from him by [he Judgment of the
“ Church,= such Separation of'the Bed being as reasonable upon account of
‘⁶ spiritual Fornication, as for carnal. And if any Heretick shall, after his
“ Fall, return to the Unity of the Church, the other married Person shall be
“ obliged to return toh'xm, . ifthey were not before parted by the Sentence of
“ the Church. But if they. were parted vae-ntence, it shall be at the Op-
“ tion of the other Party who continued >in'the Faith, whether toretnrn, οι·
