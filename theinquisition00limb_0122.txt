¹the Son was μεςος τις παΊῢς, a Part of the Famem and for this Reason declined

the Use of it. And, indeed, it doth not appear to me that the Council
of Nice had themselves any determinate and fixed Meaning to the Word, as,
I think may be fairly inferred from the Debates ofthat Council, with Eusebi-
us, Bifnop os Casarea, about that Term3 which, though put into their Creed,
in Oppofition to the Arium, was yet explained by them in such a Sense as al-
most any Arian could have, bona fide, subscribed. On the other hand, the
Bishop of Alexandria seems to have thought, that when Arius asserted that
the Son existed θελημαἹι 28, fiam τες vm‘lgcq, hythe W'ill and Counsel ofthe Eather3
it implied the Mutability of his Nature; and that, when he taught concern-
ing the Son, 071 nv 072 im mv, that there was a Time when he was n0t3 it inferred
his being a temporary and not an eternal Being3 though Arius expressy de·-
nied both these Consequences- In short, it was a Controversy upon this me-
taphyfical Question, Whether or no God could generate or produce a Being, in

StriHness ofSpeech, as eternal as himself? or, Whether God's generating the Son doth

not neceffizrily imply the Pre-exzstence of the Father‚ either επινοια, in Conception, or

not the Emperor constamine give a just Charatfiter of this Debate, when he
declared the Occafion of the Difference to be very trifling; and that their
Quarrels arose from an idle itch of Disputation‚ since they did not contend.
about any ess'ential Dofftrine of the Gospel ? Could these hard Words and in-
explicable Points justisy the Clergy in their intemperate Zeal; and in their
treating each other with the Rancour and Bitterness of the most implacable
Enemies? NVhat hath the Doftrine of real GodIiness, what bath the Church
of God to do with these Debates? Hath the Salvation of Mens Souls‚ and.
the Praffice of Virtue any Dependance upon Mens receiving unscriptural
XVords, in which they cannot believe, because they cannot understand them,
and which, those who first introduced them were not able to explain? If I
know my own Heart, I would be far from giving up any plain and important
Doetrine of the Gospel. But will any Man cooly and soberly affirm, that
nice and intricate Questions, that depend upon metaphyfical Distine'tions,
and run so high as the most minute supposeable Atome, or Point of Time,
can be either plain or important Do&rines of the Gospel? Oh Jesus! If thou
be the Son of the everlasting God, the Brighmess of thy Fasher's lery, and the ex-

Race, which the faithful Records of thy Life declare thee to be, How can I
believe the ess'ential Doe‘trines of thy Gospel to be thus wrapped up in Dark- v
ness 3 or, that the Salvation of that Church, which thou hast purchased with thy
Blood, depends on such mysterious and inexplicable Condicions? If thy Gospel
represents thee right, surely thou must he better pleased with the humble,
peaceable Christian, who, when honestly searching into the Glories of thy

Nature, and willing to give thee all the Adoration thy great Father hats] ord
