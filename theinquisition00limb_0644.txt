‘The Hrs‘ronv of the INQtJlsrrioN.

’Tis farther to be observed, that the Judge must take (Rue that it be dili-
gently and distinffly inserted at large by the Notary in the AERS, whether the
Person interrogated answered with Resolution, or in a trembling Manner,
what Signs he discovered in his Face, whether Paleness, or Trans, or Laugh-
ter, or Sweat, or Trembling·‚ because, in Case of an Appen, the superior
ludgf’, who can’t look on the Criminals and VVitness'es personally, but only
{ts [hev are described in VVriting, can’t corne to the Knowledge of these
Particiilars, unless they are described at large by the first Judge3 nor can
the Judge appealed to presume that there hath been any Inconsistency‚ be-
suuse he knew, that if there had, it ought to have been expreffed in the
Λᾶς transmitted to him. And this is the more necessary, lest the Judge
himself, upon Exaniination, should be proved [o have ordered the Crimi-
nal to be tortured without Proof, This inconsistency must be declared in
Presence of the inconsistent Witness, when the Judge intends to punish him
on this Account⁴²

And this is what Campegius partIcularly recommends to the Vica-rs or Com-
miffaries of the Inquisitor, or the other Deputies of the holy Offices, that
they let the inquisitor know how far Persons, under Examina-tion, are to be
credited‚ which principally depends on their λοοκς. He thinks the same
ought to be diligently observed, whether the inquisitor himself, or his Vi-
car, makes the Examination, *with respect to those skilful Persons, whose
Advice they take, who also ought to know these Things.

But it depends wholly on the Pleasure of the Judge‚ whether or no the
Person accused shall be tortured or not, upon Account of such Inconfistency‚
Faultering, Contradiffion, Trembling, Sweat, &a

Is there are Proofs sufficient sor Inquifition and Arrest‚ but not for the
'Torture‚ a prudent> Judge may colle& sufficient Proofs for the Torture from
such Inconfistency, and the like.

But yet there is a Case g'rven, in which a Person may be tortured, with-
out any Proofs and Copy given, viz. when the Person under Inquifition is
present, and will not answer. For then he is to be tortured not to extort a
Confeffion, but an affirmative or negative Answer. Likewise if a Person un-
der Inquifition doth not appear within the due Term, and is thereupon de-
clared guilty of Contumacy‚ and afterwards comes to purge himself from

such Cofntumacy, he may, without any other Proofs, be tortured upon Ac-
counto it.

The same Persons give us the Opinion of Gand‚ who alledging several
Reasons, concludes, that a common Reportamounts by the Canon Law to
an half full Proof, and is equal to the Evidence os one Witness‚ and that for
this Reason such common Report is sufficient to order to the Torture3 and
this he attests hath been usually practised by all the Affeffors, altho' the
Judges generally a& one way or the other, according to their different ‘'0-

1n10ns. „
