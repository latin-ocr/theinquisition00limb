318 The Hrs‘romr of the INQu rsrrron.

iigion, which the primitive Church had provided for by a quite different Method,
but that by this Means they might strip all Men of their Fortunes, and bring innocent
pers-9775 {7220 Danger ofbeing destroyed. And that this was not said without Cause,
the Netherlands alone, nocto seek for Insta'nces elsewhere, are the most evi-
dcnt Demonstration.
rom. ς. Eritium gives us this Account os the inquisition in his Time. The Affair is
p 360, cam-jesi on by Infhrmer5‚ deputed Persem, and Monks for Judges, without Honesty
³⁶¹5 At ω. [Ἔα] Form os'Law. The three former pass Sentence in Jayl, two Monks are Wit-
quh'ixiioffl7fff·5‚ and then the Stake is prepared. And afterwards: But now sometimes the
² ,Meni-5 ssi read a faiſse Report, then they carry the poor IVretch, as a suspec‘ied Per-
sen, to Jayl, there they dispute after their Mamer, the Articles are taken down, and
'the Pago-ts immediately got ready. The same Writer intimares, p. 858. ‘There is
u ‹gl-mi deal of Difference between an holy, and a false ensnaring Inquisstion. A Ρα-
ῑῖῖει· inquires into the Life of his Son, that he may take Care of it. A Phyfician in-
quires into the Distemper of his Friend to cure him. So he who loves the House of
(iod inquires into the evil Errors that are in it, to heal them if he can·‚ or if he can-
not, to cut off the incurable Member when all Methods have been tried in vain, to
prevent the Evil from spreading wider, Again, another inquires in a very different
Mas-mer only that he may betray. A Robber inquires that he may seize his Prey.
A scurrilous Person inquires that he may have an Opportunity of throwing Scandal.
An Enemy inquires, in order· to destroy. A Tyrant inquires, that he may overthrow
thepublick Liberty⁴ T he Devil also inquires, going about as a roaring Lion, seeking
whom he may devour. Such a kind of Inquifition every Christian Inquzfitor ought
to detesi. All who understand Erasmus’s Stile and Method os Writing‚ know,
that 'tis his Defign to infinuate by this Caution, that the Inquisition is truly
such as he harh described it, and which therefore ought to be abhorred by eve-
ry Christian Inquisnor.
The Papists indeed glory, that the inquisition is the most certain Remedy
l. z. t, 3· to exstirpate Herefies. Especially Ludovicusa Paramo takes a great deal of
c. 4, 5. Pains to shew, that Herefies have in several Places been extinguished by Help
of the Inquisusson, and at last concludes in these Words. Thess aresome of the
fairest Fruits, which the most fertile Field of the holy Office hath produced to the
Church in all Kingdnns where it hath not been obstruaed. But amongst all Provinees
and Ccuntries the Kingdoms of Spain do every Day receive the noblest Fruits. For
as in these Cocintries the holy Qffi‘ce of the Inquifition is maintained with greater Se-
verity, and is in greater Honour aud Esteem with the Nohles and Princes, so it flou-
rzfhes in greater Authority and Power, wherehy the Judges of the Faith carry on
more diligent Inquifition against Herestes, and more effeetually pull them up by the very
Roots. And because the Inquifition is so effedfflal a Method to exstirpate He-
refies, he gathers from thence that it was ordained for this Purpose by the
most wise Providcnce of God. But what is really unjust in it self, {md car-
ried on by unjust Methods‚ cannot have God for its Author, nor is Success
any Argument that the Inquifition is from God. The first Inquiry is, whe-
ther it be suitable to the Nature of the Christian Dostrine. If it be not, 'tis
then unjust and Anti-christian. Many Things are unrighteoussy undertaken
