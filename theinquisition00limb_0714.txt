The H1sroav of the Inoulstnon.

himself withinrfix Months before the Congregation- of the Universal Inquisi-
tion. As he did not appear, [after having observed the usual Methods inf
that Office, he was pronounced an Heretick, excommunicated, deprived of
all Dignities, Benefices and Offices whatsoever, and to have incurred all the
other Penalties which are prescribed by the sacred Canons.

Some Years after he privately abjured his Herefies, and having published?
a Writing declaring his Intention to depart out of England, he was received-
into F avour by Pope Gregory XV. and had granted him an House, Provi-
sion, Money, and other Things necessary for himself and Family, yearly,
according to his Archiepiscopal Charafier, and besides this, a noble Ecclesl-
astical Penfion. This Bounty of the Pope many Persons beheld with en·-
vious Eyes. More than this, he was restored to his Honours, so that he was
afterwards stated in the Habit and Ensigns of his Dignity, in the Seffions,
and all other Things, as tho’ he had never fallen from his Rank. These Ho-
nours, as Bzovius says, puffed him up with Pride, which he discovered in
his Gate, Countenance, and Conversation‚ as tho’ he hadsbeen called, not to
receive Mercy, but to Triumph.

Not long after thisrhe was informed against by certain Religious and others,
before the Affembly of the Universal Inquifition, that he was not afraid pri-
vately to spread the Errors he had abjured, and that he commended a certain.
Agreement cried up by himself between the Catholicks and Hereticks, and
threw out Words contrary to the Authority of the Councils, and especially
that of T rent, and that tho’ oftentimes admonished‚ he would not abstain from
such Discourses. Upon this they examined Witneffes concerning the. Mat-
ters denounced according to the Sanffions of the, Law3 and as he was parti-
cularly said to endeavour an Escape, and to gather up his Effe&s in order to
return to. his ownCountry, he was apprehended and put in Prison‚ not such
astereticks are usually confined to, but in the Castle of Adrian, where
the first Qality are usually imprisoned, some of his Domesticks being allow-
ed to attend him.

Being thus taken into Custody‚ and his Writings, according toCustom,
diligently examined, one was found amongst them concerning the Sacrament of
Matrimony, in which there were several heretica! Propofitions. Upon this
Friar Defiderius Scalea, a Predicant, Cardinal of Cremona, one of the general
Inquisitors, whom the Pope had delegated to carry on the Inquifition, and to
take Cognisance of the whole Cause, admitted other proper Witnesses, and
such as were beyond all E'xception·‚ after which Mark Anthony himself
beingbrought before him, confeffed most of those Things which he had
plainly abjured, He added, that he believed that the Church of Rome and.
the Protestants agreed in all fundamental Articles, and that as to other
Things wherein they differed, they were not equally neceffary; but that-it
might be allowed to theProtestants to abound in their own Sense, atleast‘till
these Things were more fully examined, because it might be doubted whe-
ther they were sufficientlydiscuffed and determined by the Council of Trent 3-
and that therefore such Articles might be subjeaed to a new Disputation be·>
