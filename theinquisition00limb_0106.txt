questioned, whether by Inspiration of the Spirit, I acknowledge the Roman
Church to he our ,Mother Church, ,although defiled with some Infirmitz‘es and Corrup-
τίθης. And he did behave as a very dutiful Son of that Mother Church, by
the many Favours he ssiewed to the Papists during his Reign‚ by his Procla-
mations for Uniformity in Religion, and encouraging and supporting his Bi-
ssiops in their Persecutions of such as differ’d from, or could not submit to
them. Baacrojt, promoted to the Archbishoprick of Canterbury, was, as the
Historiam calls him, Asturdy Piece, a cruel and inflexible Persecutor, treating
the Non-Conformists with the greatest Rigor and Severity3 and who, as Hey-
lin tells us, was refolved to break them, if they would not bow. He put the
Canens and Constitutions agreed on A. C. 1603. surioussy into Execution,'
and such as stood out against them, he either deprived or filenced. ,And
indeed, as the aforementioned Author says, Who could stand against a Manes
'fin-lq a spirit, armed with Authority, having tlJe Law on ¹his Side, and the King to
his Friend. During his being Archbissmp he deprived, filenced, suspended,

⁷ and admonished, above three Hundred Minister& The Violences he and his

Brethren used in the High-Commiffion Courts‚ render’d it a publick Grievance.
Every Man must conform to the Epistapal bVay, and quit his Hold in Opinion or Sase-
ty. ‘That Court was the Teucisstone, to try whether Men were Metalfor their Stamp3
and zf they were not soft enough to take such Impreffions as were put upon them,¹ they
were made malleahle there, or etse they could not paſs current. This was the beginning
of that Mischief, which when it came to a full Ripeness, made such a bloody Tinbture
in both Kingdoms, as never wilt be got out of the Bishop’s Lawn Sleeves. But no-
thing displeased the sober Part ofthe Nation more, than the Publication of the
Book ofSports, which the Bishops procured from the King, and which came
out with a Command, enjoining all Ministers to read it to their Parishioners‚
and to approve of it 3 and those who did not, were brought into ‘the High-
Commiffion, imprisoned, and suspended3 this Book being only a Trap to
catch some conscientious Men, that they could not otherwise, with all their
Cunning, ensnare. These, and such like Machinations of the Bzfhops, says my
Author, to maintain their temporat Greatness, East, and Plenty, made the Stones
in the Walls of their Palaces, and the Beam in the §T imber afterwards cry out,
moulder away, and come to nothing ·, and caused their Light to go out Offenstve
to the Nostrils of the Ruhbish of the People. Indeed many of the King’s Bithops,
such as Bancroft, Neal, and Laud, who was a reputed Papist in Oxford, and a
Man of a dangerous, turbulent Spirit, were fit sor any Work ; and as they
don't appear to have had any Principles of real Piety themselveS, they were the
fittest Tools that could be made use of to persecute those who had. Neal,
when he was Bishop of Litchfield and Coventry, prosecuted one Est-ward Wight-
man, forvbroaching erroneous Doetrine, and having canonically condemned
him, got the King’s Warrant for his Execution, and he was accordingly burnt
in Litchfietd. ,One Legat also, was prosecuted and condemned for Heresy, by
King Bishop of London, and expired in the Flames of Smithfield. He denied
the Divini'ty of our Saviour, according to the Athanastan Mode of explaining
it3 but, as Fuller tells us, he was excellently ss<illed in Scripture, and his
