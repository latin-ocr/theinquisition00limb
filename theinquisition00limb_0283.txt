Apostolick Legate, held a Provincial Synod at Lamon, to extirpate the He-
resy ochkleff3 in which were condemned eighteen of his Articles. After this
the Archbishop used great Severity against those who maintained thern, manv
of whom he condemned to the Flames. To such as abjured he appointed an
wholesome Penance, that in the Time of publick Prayers‚ and in the open
Market, they should go in Proceffion, only with their Shirts on them, carry-

Soon after arose John Huſs in Remmia, and began publickly to reprove the
dissolute Lives ofall the Orders. Whilst he inveigh'd only against the Seculars‚
all the Divines applauded him 3 but when once he began openly to reproach
>them for their corrupt Manners and Vices, they abhorred and detested him,
and used their utmost Endeavours to destroy him. At that Time, An. 1400.
Jerome of Prague returned from Engkmd, and brought with him chlffs
VVritings, which Huſs approved. And since many others approved of them,
out of Deference to the Doctrine and Authority of Huss, and defended the
Articles of Wickleff 3 those Articles were again examined and condemned, May
24, 1408. by forty Masters, and an infinite Number of Batchelors, who
prohibited, under the Penalty of the Bann, any Person to teach them. Huss
was very desirous to render all this ineffectual3 and therefore, as the Fo-
reigners were divided into three Clafl‘es of Votes‚ and the Bohemz‘ans made the
fourth, according to theInstitution of the School, he fo order'd it, that the
Bohemicms should be equal in Number of Votes to the other three : Upon which
they left Prague with Indignation‚ and went into Misnia, and there condemn-
ed again chleff's Books, and adjudged them to the F lames. Above 200 Vo-
lumes were burn'd, according to AEneas Sylvius, fairly written out, and adorn-
ed w‘ith golden Boffes and curious Binding.

Not long after this, Huss offer'd certain Theses to be publickly disputed,
by which he opposed the Indulgencies which John XXIII. had granted to
those who should engage in the Cruciad‚ which he had ordered against the
King ofNaples. Jerome of Prague‚ also shewed their Vanity. At length, after
many Proceffes formed against the Memory of Wickleffi and against Huſs, the
Council of Constance affembled, and ordered Huſs to appear before them, and

ing, anci³ departure thence. In this Synod the Dostrine of Wickleff and Huss
was condemned: Several learned Men were deputed to examine both their
Doctrines, who when they had read their Books, pronounced that they had
found forty five pernicious Articles in chleff, and thirty in Huss 3 which tho’
they were not allos them equally impious, some being worse than others, yetall
contained deadly Poison, and were altogether, or at least, in some Part, con-
trary to the wholsome Doctrine of the Church ε Upon this the Synod not on-
ly condemn’d the Books, but pronounced vSentence against Wickkff, though
dead, by which they declared him an Heretick‚ excommnnicated him, and

ordered his BoneS, if they could be Qud, to be taken out of their (ἔταξε grad
