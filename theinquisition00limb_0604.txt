¹74 The HtsToRY of the INQUISITION.

Enemy, who had bribed his Servants‚ was condemned to a nine Years Banish-
ment in Africa, and the suborned Witnesses to the Gallies for five. Carena
also relates from Diana, that in the Inquifition in Sicily, a certain Regular,
who was a false VVitness‚ and who had suborned others to give false Evidence
in the holy Office, was condemned to the Gallies for ten Years, and the Wo-
men, his Accomplices, to be whipped, and to fix Years Banishment.

From these ssight PunishmentS, which, if compared with the Heinousness
ofthe Offeuoe, bear no Proportion with it, 'tis evident that the Inquifitors are
not willing to deter any one from giving Evidence. And indeed here is a great
Inequality between the Offence and Punishment. Ifany one grievoussy wounds
a X'Vitness, who hath born Witness against him, altho' he bath not killed him,
he is punished with Death 3 and if the Wound be ssight, he is condemned for
ever, or at least for ten Years, to the Gallies. Whereas he who gives false
Witness, and suborns and bribes others to fix by false Evidence a Crime upon
another, which being proved by the Agreement ofthe 'Witneffeffi the Crimi-
nal must suffer the cruel Punishment ofbeing burm, is only banished, and the
false Witnesses condemned to nothing more than the Gallies for ten or five
YearS, or to be bastinadoed, and banished for fix. Now who doth not see,
that the Inquisitors are careful only to provide for the Security of the Witnes-
ses, and had rather condemn Persons loaded with salse Accusations, than deter
any one by the Severity os Punithment from giving a false Evidence, which,
in this Case, ought especially to be regarded, because the Witneffes are not
discovered to the Criminal.

Hoofdii‚ A much more exemplary Punifhment was inflicted upon a Woman, con-
flss- Bel-12⁷·svi5ted of giving false Evidence, at the Hague, by the Command of the Court
'²' of Helland, An. 1551. Wllz'am Bardefius, Praetor os Amsterdam, and M. Hen-
νγ Theodorus, Consul of the same City, were at morta] Enmity with each other,
upon Account of some political Differences. The Consul burnt with a Desire
of Revenge, and that he might have a specious Pretence for destroying his E-
nemy, determined to accuse him of the Anabaptistical Heresy, at that Time
universally hated for the late Disturbances which had been raised on that Ac-
count at issmfic r and Amsterdam. Hejoined with him in this Design, Florentius
Egberti, Parissi-Priest ofthe Old Church, and Commiffary os Ram-dus Tappe·
rus the Inquisitor, that the Fraud being thus covered over with an Ecclefiasti-
cal Varnish, might be carried on with greater Success. They could not find
outa more proper Instrument to execute this vile Defign, than a certain old
Woman named Sophy‚ nick-named Tellow Sophy, upon account of the execrable
Colour ofher Body, a Widow, burthened with a great many Children, who
made it her ssufiness to betray the Reformed‚ who held their private Meeting5‚
not being allowed the Use of the publick Churches, and maintained her wretch-
ed Family with the accursed Wages she earned‚ by informing against them.
Th:3 Woman, with two others of the same Stamp, and two Men, one of
which wasa Notary, they prevailed with, by a little Money, and large Pro-
miseS, to bear salse Witness against the Praetor. Their several Evidences‚
which were suggested to them by the Consul and the parson, they confirmed
