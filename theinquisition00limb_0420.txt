¹- 42· Constitution‚ that the Effecfits of penitent Hereticks are not sold. But in Spain,
§-17· the Effeas of HeretickS, though penitent, are confiscated, not only by the
Papal, but Royal Laws.
But as to the Seizure and Application of such confiscated Effeets, the Civil
L. Mani· Law thus determines. Whom also we persue with the publication of all their
‘hw- Effeffls. However such Effects, published because of Heresy, were not
{⁰5¹⁸ de condemned to the Treasury, if the Children of such Hereticks were Catho-
aeiet. licks 3 as is plain from the before-mentioned Law. Neither do we permit their
Children to become their Heirs, unless they forsake their Parents Wickedneſs. It is al·
so farther explained, L. Cognovimus, C. de haeret. to whom the confiscated Ef-
fec'ts of Hereticks shall be applied, if their Children are not Catholicks, viz.
to their next Relations and Kindred, if Orthodox and Catholick. But if none
such are to be found, the Effeets are all to be converted to the Treasury of
the secular Prince. And a little after, in Authent. §. fi quis de predia‘lis. this
Method of Succeffion is prescribed, if the F athers should be Catholicks, and
their Children Hereticks. Because heretical Children and Relations cannot suc-
ceed Catholick Parents, if the F ather be a Clergyman, the Church shall inherit 3
if a Layman, his Estate shall go to the Treasury. Many Ages after this, Fre·
derick the Emperor, by a Law beginning, Catharos. thus ordained‚ about the
Year 1220. We condemn all Hereticks ‘ff both Sexes, and every Name, to perpetual
Infamy, we deprive them of our Proteblion, and put them under the Bann, ordering
their Effeffls to be confiscated, and never more to return to them, fh that their Chil-
clren fhall never come to the Poffieffion of them, fince ’tis much more heinous to offend
the eternas than the temporal Majesty.
But as the Crime of Heresy is merely Ecclefiastical‚ they contend tha-t the
Ecclefiastical Laws, which order all Things relating to the Punishment of it,
ought to prevail, and be every where observed. And therefore since the

Confiscatmn of Effec'ts is one of the Penalties ordained against Hereticks‚ they
affirm, that what hath been ordained by the Ecclesiastical Papal Laws and

Constitutions, ought to be obser-ved by all that would approve their Obedi-
ence to the Church of Rome.

Pope Innocent III. in the Year of our Lord 1 199 or 1200. and second Year
of his Papacy, first ordained at the Lateran, April Cal. 8. by a decretal Epi-
stIe, beginning, Vergentis in senium, directed to the Clergy‚ Consuls, and
People of Viterlm, that the Effeets of Hereticks should be confiscated', as had
been determined by the Civil Laws, and that they should be applied to the
Treasury of the Church in the Countries subje& to her, and in other Domi·
nions of the Empire, to the Treasury of the secular Judge.. And this he com.-
mands to be observed, although Hereticks should have Catholick Children,
who by the Civil Law were allowed to succeed to their Parents Estates. The
same confiscation of Effeets, afew Years aster, viz. An. 121 5. was decreedin
