The H1s'ronr of the INQUISITloN. '45

pointed against the Defenders of Hereticks. Whosoever shall dare to rescue an
heretical Man or Woman, when taken, from him or those who have apprehended
them, or to prevent their being taken, or to hinder any one's Entrance into any House
or Tower, in order to seize or search for them, let such an one, according to the Padua
Lawof Frederick the Emperor, uffer Confiscation of Goods, and perpetual Ba-
mfhment‚ and let the Houje from which they were excluded be raJed to the Ground,
and never rebuilt ·, and let the Effec‘ls found there he his who can fieize them, as tf
Hereticks had been attually found there. Moreover, he makes their Sons infamous,
and excludes them from all Honours‚ unless they discover Hereticks. But is
they discover them, they are delivered from these Penalties. Pius V. also by
acertain Rescript, beginning, Si de protegendis, ordained the most severe Pu-
nishments against the Defenders of Hereticks‚ which they incur in many Cases

therein mentloned.

CHAP. IX.

Of the Favozcrers of HE RE T 1 cKs.

H E Favourers of Hereticks, as the Name shews, are those who sher530·
F avour to Hereticks‚ and are in all Things equal to the Defenders of
them. They are either Magistrates or private Persons, and they may all fa-
vour Hereticks by Omiffion or Negligence, by Deed or Affistance, and finally
by Counsel or Words. The Magistrates Office is-to extirpate Hereticks, and

of Hereticks, and the Suppression os all rising Heresies, because the Inquisitors
without the Magistrates Help are weak, and cannot drive awa-y Hereticks ;
and therefore they must bend all their Endeavours to this, that the Wicked-
ness of Hereticks may not encrease under their Government, and the Security
and Religion of the Catholicks be not diminished or disturbed. The Favou-
rers therefore of Hereticks are suen : First‚ who omit to do those Things con·
cerning Hereticks, or Persons suspeffited and defamed for Heresy, or those
who believe, receive, defend, and favour them, which they are obliged to do
by Office, when required to do it by the lnquifitors or Bishops, or* one os
them, viz. if they do not take them up, keep them in safe Custody‚ send
them to the appointed Place, or if theyvdon't readily punish them, when con·
demned and delivered over to them. For they are obliged to all these Things.
