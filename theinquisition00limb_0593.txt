Criminal‚ and under Inqmfflion, in the Jayls of this holy Office‚ for fiich Couses as
appear in the Atts of the said holy Office, and that I will maintain his Cause, and
that I will not instruet this my said Principal to conceal the ‘Truth in his Trial,
and that as far as I shall know this my said Principal to be guilty, convieted of the
Crime, or criminal, in the Matter or Matters for which he is inquifited‚ I will
throw up his Defence .· And moreover‚ as soon as [shall have Knowledge in the Ma-

their Stipend from the Treasury, when they defend the Causes of the Poor,
which is usually very small, but honourable. But if the Criminals are not
poor, the Advocates receive their Pay out of their Effe&s. Instrutt. 1. c. 16.
Whatever the Advocates alledge‚ in the Presence of the Criminal, is taken,
as if it had been alledged by the Criminal himself, unless the Advocate hath
been mistaken, and the Prisoner contradicts it within three Days. But in
the Cause of Heresy‚ if after three Days it shall appear that the Advo-
cates have been mistaken, or imprudent‚ it shall not prejudice the Criminal,
because it seems, in this Judgrnent, they act *with Simplicity and the
highest Equsty, and rejecit the Rigour of the Law. If the Crimina] says the
Crimes obje&ed to him are forged‚ his Advocate advises him either to chal-
lenge the false Wstneffes, or to find out some just Exception and Defence, and.
says he is prepared to defend his Cause as far asjust.

γ The Criminal also had formerly allowed him a Procurator. But these Pro· Peene·
»curators are now seldom allowed, because the Advocates are suffizient, and “W-²3⁹
exercise the Office of Procurators. Yea, they say that the Inqlifitors ap-
pear more truly to be the Procurators of the Criminals, since by Office they
are to take Care of the Criminals DefenceS. Concerning these we thus read
in the Madrid Instruffion, An. 1561. e. 35. Altho' the Instruttion provides that
Procurators fhall be allowed the Criminals, yet they ought not to be granted them,
because Experience teaches that many Inconveniencies arist? from thence ·, and because
of the little Advantage which the Criminals obtain by it, they shall not be any longer
allowed them: Altho' sometimes when the Case is urgent, ’tis allowed the Advo-
cate to defend the Criminals.

If the Criminals are under twenty-five Years of Age, they are allowed

Curators (a sort of Guardians) by whose Authority they are defended, least,
thro’ Unskilfulness or Youth‚ they should conceal, or say any Thing‚ which

tf spoken or 'concealess might be othcssvantage to them. The ἓίῗίξᾱξὲἐ
