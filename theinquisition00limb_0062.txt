The Truth is, that the Christian Clergy were now become the chief Incen-
diaries and Disturbers of the Empire‚ and the Pride of the Bfflmps, and the
Fury of the People on each fide were grown to such an Heighr, as that there 2
scarce ever was an Eleffion or Restoration of a Bishop in the larger Cities‚ but
it was attended with Slaughter and Blood. Athanafius was several Times ba-
nilhed and restored, at the Expence of Blood ·‚ the Orthodox were deposed,
and the Arians substituted in their soom, with the Murther of Thousands ; and

This was the unhappy State of the Church in the Reign of Constantius, which..
affords us little more than the History of Councils and Creeds differing from,
