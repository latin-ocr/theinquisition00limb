this Law unjust, and injurious to the prelatical Authority. And therefore,
that their Pow er 1111 g'ht not be wholly suppreffed by this Law, he sent Letters to
the King, in which he set before him the Examples of Charles the Great‚ Theo-
(ἕψω, and V deniae the Emperors, who had greatly enlarged the Power of
the Bishops, and yet had not obscured the Glory of their own Majesty, but ra—
ther increaled it, and admonished him to repeal those Laws, which were con-
trary to the Eccleli istic il Liberty. He then put him m Mind ofthe Sentence
pronounce d by Her-etius, by which the Makers of such Laws exposed them-
selves to Anathema' 3, unless they repealed them within two Months. The
King, who was soliciting the Title of the obedient Son of the Church, yielded
to the Papal Severity, and was entreated by Gregory, that he would finish

the W 011< of cutting off all the Remains of Heresy 1n the Province of fl'holouse,
and comp< 61 Earl Εαγηοηῑῖ to perform his Promise,

an Army into the Holy Land, when he was at Paris, and had made Peace
with the Fr ezch King and the Church. But as there happen' d a Tumult at
‘Thala ul} agii nst the Censors of the Faith, raised by those who were said to be
inseeted with Heresy, and as there was not an immediate Stop put to it upon

its first Beg nnmg, the Earl seem’ d to have broke his Promise, and to cherish
Hereticks, t>because he did not restrain their Fury, Upon this the Pope severe-

The Pope gave fresh InstruCtions to his Legate on this Affair, and ordered him
to renew the Tholouse Statutes‚ to rejest all the Edicts and Laws, which in-
fringed the Ecclefiastic 11 Liberty‚ to remove from the publick Counsels all
suspetffted or defamed of Heresy. And by other Letters he was order’ 61 to

He also most earnestly entreated the French King‚ that he would use the
Power committed to him by God, to compel the Earl and Consuls of Tholousb to
amend the aforesaid Crimes, and do his utmost to extirpate Heresy. Then he
admonished him to force the Earl to go to Jerusalem the next March, and send
his own Brother Alphonfus, to whom Raymond's Daughter had been betrothed,
to administer the Affairs of the Earldom of Tholouse.
