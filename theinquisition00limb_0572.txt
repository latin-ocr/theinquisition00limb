ireff. But Pegna says, ifthere are many fingle Witneffes‚ and one deposes as to
.1»·t.3. the Fater, another as to the common Fame, one as to what he saw, another
⁷0¹: com. as to what he heard, the Criminal cannot be condemned, no not altho' the

common Fame, legally proved, strengthens the Testimony of the fingle
Witnel's. However‚ the Inquifitor may at Pleasure enjoin such Criminals
I’urgation‚ or any other Penance. If several VVicnesses testify separately of
different ffirefies, and a different Time and Place‚ this will not prove a
Man an Heretick3 no, nor is it full Proof if they testify of the same Here-
sy, but differ as to Time and Place. But if any one is convi&ed by more
than two proper Witnefles‚ and willnot confess, some say they must wait for
some time, and see' if they can find out Witnesses agreeing in all Things 3
but first the Criminal is to be tortured, that if it can be they may draw the
Truth from his Mouth. If he confesses nothing he may be most justly
compelled to abjure as one vehemently suspeffed, or to undergo canonical
Purgation, because, in this Case‚ he cannot be thought to have purged away
the Evidence by Torture‚ fince the Proofs against him are many and
stronor. ’
Part. 3⁴ ngever, in such a Case‚ 'tis left to the Inquifitors Pleasure to proceed as
com. 12¹· they think fit, as ’tis expressly commanded in the Constitutions of the Bishop
of Albano, Legate of the Apostolick See, who, 'tis probable‚ was ap-
pointed Legate, and published by the Pope's Commisfion many ConstitutIOns„
relating to the Punishment of Hereticks‚ and the Order of proceeding against
them, about the Time when the poor Men of Lions, or the Albigenses and
other Hereticks infested the Countries of France and Lombardy. These Con-
stitutions are very useful to private Inquifitors‚ to enable thern to determine
«rightly and profitably Causes and Controverfies of the Faith‚ and are ex-
tant in an old Parchment Manuscript in the Vatican Library‚ and in a very
old one at Florence. Amongst other Things in it’tis thus determined. But when
the thcffi’s or Informers differ in what they depost, but yet agree in the Substance
and Nature of the Thing, we leave it to the Pleafizre af the Inquifitorssb to proceed, as,
in the sight of God, they shall think fit, especially zf common Fame, and the Fitness and
Credit of the Deposers agree and make against him, who is to undergo the Inquzfition,
