Heretick by any one of the Bilhops, should be condemned to the Fire, by
the Duke and Senators, or at least the major Part of them ²‘'‘. And least
their should be any Hindrance to this Affair, by the Death of a single Bi-
shop, it was afterwards decreed, that such also should be condemned to the
Fire‚ who were pronounced Hereticks by the Biihops Vicars‚ upon the De-
mise of the Bishop †. In this process, the secular Judges appointed by the
Commonwealth‚ made Inquifition against Hereticks. The Bishopjudged con-
cerning their Faith‚ whether it was agreeable to the Roman Faith, or here-
tical. Then the Duke and Senators pronounced sentence, not as meer Exe-
cutors ofthe Bishop’s, but as Judges‚ properly so called : But Nicholtzs IV,
a minor Friar‚ being exalted to the Pontificate‚ in order to execute the Pur-2
poses of his Predeceffors, and exalt the Friars ofhis own Order, did not cease
his Endeavours, till he had got the Office of the Inquisition received by a
publick Decree at Verzz‘ce3 but under this Limitation, to prevent Scandah
that the Duke alone should have Power to affist the Inquifitors in the Execu-
tion of their Office; that a Treasury should be appointed, and an Admini-
strator set over it, who should disburse the necessary Sums for the Office,
and should receive and keep all the Profits accruing from it, to the Treasury.
This was done in the Year 1289. The Pope acquiesced in this Decree; and
thus the Office of the Inquifition at Venice consisted of Secular and Ecclesl-
astical Persons, and doth so to this Day·, three Inquifitors affi-sting at it in
the Name of the Prince. The Ecclefiasticks have been indeed endeavouring
to bring it entirely into their own Hands‚ but could never prevail with the
Veneticm Senate to agree to it. In the Year 1301. Friar Anthony, an Inquisi-
tor‚ would feign have persuaded Duke Peter Gradenigo, to have bound
himself by an Oath, to observe the Pontifical and Imperia] Laws against
HeretickS. But the Duke answered, by a publick Rescript‚ that he was
no ways obliged to take a new Oath3 because when he was raised to the
high Office ofDuke‚ he confirmed by an Oath the concordate with Nicholas
IV. and therefore infisted that he was no ways bound, by any Pontifical or
Imperial Laws, not agreeing with this Concordate. Upon this Answer, the
Inquifitor defisted from his Attempt.

From these Things 'tis evident‚ that the Venetiam Inquifition is very diffe-
rent from what it is in other Countries‚ where Ecclefiasticks, intirely devo-
ted to the Pope of Rome, have the whole Management of it. For whereas,
in other Places the Cognizance of Heresy belongs only to the Ecclesiasticks ς

Ἀ and whereas all who bear any Part in that Judgment, as Affeffors„ Coun-

 

sellors, Notaries, or Witneffes, take an Oath of Secrecy to the Inquifitors,
whereby the Magistrate is no more than the blind Executor of the Inqui—
fitor's Sentence ; the Venetian Senam, by a wife Distinfflon, confiders three
Things separately in this Affair: The Judgrnent concerning the Doftrine
for which any Person is to be pronounced an Heretick: The Judgment
