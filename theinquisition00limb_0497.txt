to be the Aunios, infers, that such Persons are accounted Relapsed. Second,

Pegna notes, That this Opinion‚ stmply taken, is not true, bnt that many Heads must ⁸
be distinguished, that the Truth may be understood, ns we have taught in our Direfiory
of the Inquisttors‚ p. 3. q. 97. But between these and the former sort of re-
lapsed Pers0n3‚ there is this Difference‚ that the former are to be left without
any Mercy to the secular Arm3 but as to the latter, 'tis in the Inquifitors
Pleasure to deliver them to the secular Judgment or not.

However, all who do not observe the Penance enjoined them, are not pro- Simanc.
miscuoussy accounted Relapsed. This Penance is either altogether contrary tit. 470
to Heresy‚ viz. if the Penitent be commanded to abjure, to preach against §- ⁷⁷·
his Errors, not to communicate with Hereticks‚ and the like. In this Case,
if he doth not obey, they say he may be punished as a Relapse. Or the
Penance tends to the Purgation of his Faust, viz. when Fastfflgs, Prayers‚
and other pious Works are enjoined the Penitent. In this Case he who doth
not perform every Thing‚ may be punished with an arbitrary Fine. But Si-
mancas is osa different Opinion, who thinks such Persons to be obstinate, im·
penitent, or any Thing rather than Relapsed; and that therefore Penance
ought to be again enjoined them at the Pleasure of the Judges, according to
the Nature of their Crime.

In like manner he who is condemned to perpetual Imprisonment, and escapes Simanc.
out of it, is generally accounted as a Relapse, because his Converfion seems to tit. ¹6·
have been feigned, and he himself to have fallen into his former Error. §· ²4³ ²5·
Bernard Comenfis is ofthis Opinion. But Simnncns rejects this Opinion as cruel Lucem.
and false, and says, such a one is an Impenitent‚ but not a Relapse. So thatInq-voce

may be condemned as an Impenitent. But if either he returns himself, or is
apprehended, and ready to satisfy the Church., then he is to be enjoin'd a grea-
ter Penance upon account of his Escape‚ but is to be kindly received into the
Bosom of the Church.

As to the Puniffiment of the Relapsed‚ the Council of T arragone hath for-
merly thus determined. Some Persons doubt, whether Persons relapfhd into the
Belicf of Hereticks‚ and dogmatzfing Heretz'cks, ought to be left to the secular Judgment,

if after they are apprehended they will repant. To us it seems that they ought ms. ΒΨ
