the new Christians offered him a large Sum of Money, and besought him,
that he would procure in their Favour a general Indulgence from the Pope,
But 116 contemned their Prayers, though he was at that Time at War with
France and England, his Divines suggesting to him, That God was greatly
offended with such Money, and that he could expe& no prosperozts Succeſs from it,
The following Years the new Christiana in Portugal endeavoured by many
Entreaties to procure the Abolition, or at least Mitigation of the Inqui-
fition. For after that King Alphonsus was expelled his Kingdorn, and suc..
ceeded by his Brother Peter, he endeavoured to gain the Affeftions of his
SubjeEts by Indulgence and Kindness, the better to establisti his new Power,
which gave some Hopes to the new Christians of being released from the
I'nquifition. Upon this they deputed certain Persons‚ who on the 9th of June,
An. 1676. presented, in the Name ofthe wholeNati0n‚ their humblel'etirion [Ο
his Highness‚ in which they represent to him, that they had before offered their
humble Petition to him, for Leave humbly to defire of the Pope some
Mitigation of the Inquisition‘, putting him in mind, that after mature Ad,
vice of many Divines, and Dostors of the Law, he had condescended to
their Request. They add, that for this End they had sent their Ambaffa-
dor extraordinary to Rome, and thatthe Office of the Inquifition, and Col-
lege of Bfflmps, had also sent thither Deputies, who were both Inquisitors,
furnished with the Letters of his Highness. But that they were certified
by Letters from Rome, that his Ambaffador had not only refused to procum
them any Affistance, but joined his Endeavours with those of 1116111011ῐῇ-
tors Deputies, to prevent their Affair from being ever brought on the Car-
pet, because they did not care that the least Alteration should ever be made
in the Laws of the Inquisition. They therefore requested from his High-

ness an authentick royal Instrument, to certify the Pope, and the supreme,

Congregation of the Inquisltion at Rome, that it was nothis Highness's In-
tention, that the Decifion of their Cause should be suspended, but that it
was his Defire that they should have Justice. The same Day also they pre-
sented an humble Petition to the King’s Confeffor, to beseech him, that he
would dispose his Highness to grant their Request.

But as all this proved in vain, they presented an humble Petition to the
Pope, Jan. 1o, 1680„ in which they acquaint him, that they were sent and
deputed by the new Christians in the Kingdom of Portugccl, and especially by
those who were detained in the Prison of the Inquffidon, who were about
500 in Number, of all Sexes and Condition8‚ some of them having been
there tweIVe, others fourteen‚ and none of them less than seven Years, and
almost destroyed by Nastiness and Filth. They farther relate the various
Miseries of the new Christians, and how their Afl'air hath been preventa}
from being expedited by the Artifices of the Inquifitors. Thev therefore be·-
seech the Pope that he would grat-ioussy regard and pity that miserable Peo-
ple, and renew his Commands to the Inquifitorss to hasten their Affair: Ami
the more to move him, they give him Specimens, which they affirm they
can prove by proper WitneffeS, by which it plainly appears that the lnqui*
