 

The H1sr0mr ofthe INQulslrioN·

If he is violently suspected, altho’ it may be that he '15 no Heretffck' yet
b the construction of the Law he is accounted one, and judged as such.
X hat this Judgment is, shall be hereafter explained.

If he is found suspected of Heresy, and also defamed, he is condemned
first to purge himself by his Compurgators‚ and after he hath thus purged
himself as a defamed Person, he must abjure as one suspected of Heresy,
whether it be lightly, vehemently, or violently, according to the Manner in
which such Persons are dealt with, and he is injoined Penance, heavier or
lighter, according as his Suspicion is greater or less. When the Sentence is
pronounced, and committed to Execution, it may be dispensed with, mitiga-
ted, or commuted‚ as the Affair, or the Amendment and Humility ol the
Penitent deserves it.

[What the Manner is of proceeding at this Day in the Inquifition general
at Rome, against Persons suspeeted of Heresy, we have a most clear Instance,
in the Sentence pronounced against Galileus Galilei‚ a famous Astronomer, be-
cause he taught, that the Sun stood immovable in the Midst of the Universe,
and that the Earth moved round it as about its proper Center. Ι have
thought it worth while to transcribe it here intire, that it may appear, that
Opinions purely Astronomical, and that have nothing to do with Religion,
and which can neither be of any Advantage or Differvice to Piety, which
soever fide of the Question is defended, are a sufficient Argument to the
Roman Inquifitors‚ to render any one vehemently suspected of Heresy, after
the Prelates of that Church have once determined on one fide, and to injoin
him a solemn Abjuration, which it self is a very grievous Punishment in the
Inq‘uiaeeogaspghgozigfegietixsetiipiile of Saina‘le Croix de Hierusalem.
