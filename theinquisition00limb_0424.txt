you of the Profils arifing from the Office qf the Inquisttion, any Constitutimz, Custom,

Andlastly, Friar Bemmrd Comensts, in his Light of the Inquiffiors, hath

imm 12ae- given us this short Account of the whole Affair. “ The Effects of Hereticks,
m· 4 ‘⁴ since they are ipst) jure confiscated from the Day of the Crime committed,

shall not be sold or alienated by the said HeretickS. Yea, the Treasury or

“ Inquisitors shall reclaim the said Effecis, if sold or alienated‚ out of the
‘⁶ Hands of the Poffeffors‚ without any Charge, through what Hands soever

“ they may have passed ς unless the Price, or something equivalent to it, was
‘ ‘ amongst the Effeds of the said Heretick thus alienating them.

“ The Ordinary or Diocesan shall have no Part of the Profits of the Goods

‘⁵ of Hereticks, appropriated to the Office of the inquisit-ion although he
‘⁶ himself proceeds in the said Office ; but must dilcharge his fiuty at his own

‘⁶ proper Expences‚ and out of his own Returns, because he is the Ordinarv,
‘⁶ according to the Extravagant of Benedici? XI. beginning, Ex eo quod. Nbr
“ are theInquilitors obliged to give an Account to the said Diocesans of the
‘⁶ Effects accrewing to the Office of the Inquifition, Ibid.

‘⁶ Whereas the Cross—bearers now generally provide, in Aid ofthe Office

“ of the Inquifition, all the neceffary Expences of the said office, at the
‘1 Pleasure of the Inquifitors, and appoint such Officials as are necess‘ary to
“ the said Office, and pay them, as the Inquisitors order them 3 they have
‘³ therefore now introduced a Custom‚ that the ConfiscatIOns made of the
‘⁴ Effeets of Hereticks by the Inquisstors, shall be applied to the Office of
‘⁵ the Inquisstion, and administred by the Inquifitors, or the said Cross-bearers,

¹‘ at the Pleasure of the Inquisitors‚ to expedite the Affairs of the said Of-
“ fice, and in all Causes appertaining to it.

‘⁶ When the Effecis osHereticks are confiscated, such Confiscation reaches

‘⁶ not only to such Effects as are found in the Territory where the Condem-
“ nation is made, but to such as are found in any other Territory ς, and the

‘⁶ Execution shall be made by the Officials of that Place where the Goods
⁸⁴ are. For Instance, it a Man is born at Bologne, and hath a good Estate

“ there, and yet builds himself an Ho-use at Florem, and is by the Inquisi-
“ tor of Floreme condemned there for Heresy ·‚ in such Case the Inquisitor of
‘⁴ Bologne shall seize upon all his Effects which he finds there, because the
“ Purse of the Church of Rome equally extends to Bologne as to Florence. But

“ 'tis northus with the Part that comes to the Officials. See the Declara- ι
“ tion osNz‘cholaus IV. An. 1291. 052. 5.

‘⁶ The moveable Effer-‘ts of the Criminal, which are found in any other

⁴⁶ genitam, must go to the Treasury of such Place in which they are con-
6‘ emne .
