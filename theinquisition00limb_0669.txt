The H1sromr ofthe INQUISITION.

After these Things follows a long Abjuration of a certain triangular Fi-
gure used by him, and called the Shield of Faith, and then he goes on. Be·
fides, that it may appear to all what were the Reasons why I have been resutca' to
adhere to andfavour the said late John Huss, I notify by these Preſsnts, that where-
as I had often heard him in his Preachings and Schools, Ibet‘ieved him to he a good
Man, and to go in nothing contrary to the Traditions of our hoZy Mother Church and the
hely DoHors 3 yea, as there were certain Articles lately offered to me in this City,
laid down by him, and condemned by this holy Council, I did not at first View believe
them to be his, at least in that Form: And when I had heard it affirmed by several
famous Doaors and Masters in Divinity, that they were his, I defired, for my full

Information, that they would fhew me the Books of his own Hand—writing, in which <

the said Articles are said to be contained, which being shewn to me written with his
5355 ffr‘lssssislssffl'wffiss i} Ξῗὲἶῗῑὲἳῖἱῖίῆἱῖἓέ ἕῖἒείῑζῖζ’ἑξεῗζῖἔέἑζῇἴὲἷῖᾭνὶῗῖ
whence I have found, and do find, that he and his Doii‘rine, with their Followem,
have been deservedly condemned and rejec‘i‘ed as heretical and mad, by the holy C oun·
cil. And all theſs? ‘Ihings aforesaid I affirm purely, and without any Reserve, as one
who is now fully and sufficiently informed of the aforesaid Sentences pronounced by this
holy Conncil against the Doe‘i‘rines of the said late John Wycleff and John Huss,
and against their Perfhns 3 to which Sentences I do, as a devoted Catholick, in and
concerning all Things humbly consent and adhere.

After this he abjured the Opinion, that F aith was to take place even in the

future Life, and concludes thus. Moreover Iswear both by the holy Trinity, asa-<t ’

by these most holy Gospels, that I will always, and without Doubt‚ remain in the
Truth of the Catholick Church, and pronounce all those who fhall oppofe this Fano,
together with their Opinions, worthy of eternal Damnation. And if I iny fiis shall a:
any time, which Godforbid‚ presumo to think or preach any ‘Thing to the contrary, I
subjec‘i my self to the Severity of the Canons, and shall he found obnoxious to eternal
Punilhment. And this Confeffion and Writing of my own Profiffion I do voluntat-ily
offer to this holy general Council, and have fitbscribed the same with my own proper
Hand, and have written all these Yhings„ This Abjuration was made Septem-
ber 15, 1415.

Jerom of Prague seems to have-been terrified by the Condemnation ofJolsfi
Huſs‚ and to have fallen thro’ the Infirmity of human Nature. But after-
wards he took Courage, and with great Resolution revoked his Abjuration in
the Synod‚ and was, May 30, 1416. pronounced, declared‚ and condemned
by the Council of Constance as an Heretick, and relapsed into Heresy, ex-
communicated,rand anathematised, and as such deliver'd over to the seculu-
Arrn3 and being brought to the Stake he suffer’d Deaeh, and endured the
severest Torments ofthe Fire‚ with a truly heroick Mind.

And in this Manner all Persons are forced to abjure, which the Chusch os
Rome pronounces Hereticks‚ unless they are willing to be delivered over a>-
impenitent Hereticks to the seculae Arm or Court, but especially Doe‘wm
whom they call Dogmatists, Dogmatisers, and Arch-hescticks. &erfo-4
under the Year 1479. §. 9. gives us a famous Instance which hapa& in Sym-2.
