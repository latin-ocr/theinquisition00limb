sao The HISTORY ofthe INQUISITIONss

gry Fathers have said of, or imputed to their Adversaries, especially as they

have taken Care to suppress their Writings. Cunaeus very solidly and gravely

vstrat-fai. in pronounces his Opinion of the Greek Fathers‚ viz. The common People think,
{2¹13ss that he must be ‘very-criminal, who doch not believe, that Piety, the great Sup-

they have done ill defignedly, and were of a very bitler Spirit. Not to mention
others, the Greek Fathers, thro' a national Vice, were always too violent on both

Sides. They had all of them a rolling Eloquence, admirable Learning, and a
Genius fit for every thing; and on these Accounts one may discern a Sharpness

and Eagerness breathing throughout all the Remains they have transmitted to Po-

sterity. As for those they were angry with, tho' great Men in themselves, and
worthy the highest Commendation, they blacken'd them as the vilest Persons ·, and

on the other hand, they were sb lavish of their Praises on those they approved, that,

tho’ they had little to deserve it, Posterity admires their Virtues, and even adores

a Stone of their Sepulchre as a God. Not much different from this, is that Pas-
5.11.p.663sage of Melchior Canus, in his Common Places of Divinity .· I cannot excuse
Sozomen’s Lyes: For he was a Greek, which Notion is and ever was ad-

ditted to lying. And he was so fully convinced‚ that the most shameful. Lyes

had crept into the Histories of his own Church‚ that he breaks out into

&⁶502 this Complaint: J speak it rather with Gricys, than as a Matter of Reproach,
that Laertius bath written the Lives of the Phitossphers with greater Regard to

T ruth, than Christians have the Lives of their Saint53 and that Suetonius's Ac-

count of the Caesars is written with greater Incorruptness and Integrity, than the
Account which the Catholicks have given, I will not say of their Emperors, but

of their Martyrs, Virgins‚ and Confeffors. T he two former have not eonceated the

real or suspetted Vices of their best Philosophers or Princes, nor the Appearances

of Virtue in the worst3 whereas ours, sor the most part, either are governed by

‘their Paffions, or industriousty forge so many idle Stories, that I am not only afhamed

but tired of them. Such as ineſse are so far from being useful to the Church of Christ,

that they greatly diffi’rve its Interest. I forbear their Names, because here I blame

their Morals, and not their Learning, as to which the Censure might be more

free. As to Behaviour, one ought to be more cautious towards the Living, and

more respettful towards the Dead: But this is certain, that whoever mix Fable

and Falshood with Ecclesiastical History, can't be good and upright Men, and

their whole Account can be invented for no other Purpose‚ but to increase their

Gains, or to establilh Error3 of which the first is vile, the other pernicious.

2354} And alittle after, describing the Office of a good Historian, he says: Yhat
he ought not to dare to say any thing false, or omit any thing true, that he may'nt

be suspetted to write either out of Favour or Hatred. He adds: Since theſs?

51⁴ hings are neccffary Marks of Honesty and Integrity, 'tis strange that Suetonius

should have obfi’rved them all, and almost all ours have entirely omitted them.

'Tis no difficolt Matter to conjefture what their Candour and F idelity is,

in relating the Affions of their Adversaries, and those whom they have

¹condemned for Hereticks, who have been so immoderate and fals} in their
ommene-
