although the Punifhments enjoynecl Penitents‚ by way of wholesome

Pencmces, are arbitrary, and left to the Pleasure of the Inquifitors,

yet they are direffled hy some certain Laws and Cestoms, so that,
upon hearing the Crimes read obseb‘t'ed to any Crimuml, it may, from

Ἰ have not, through an Attachment to any Party, written any
Thing contrary to Truth. I have made use of ‘Popifh Authors, yea,
Inquisttors themselves, and Counsellors of the htqitisttiottr, who are ρ
far from having written any ‘Ibtng emerue, out of Hatred to the In..
quisition, that they! every where 013¹ up the Sano't'ity of it, and, without
End or Measure, inculcate its vast Advantage to the Church of Rome ,-
and therefore, whatever they write concerning the Inquifitimz, and

own Bootes, ‘without any Alteration, unless where, because of their
Prolixness, I haee abridged them,· and, even then, I have* made uste
