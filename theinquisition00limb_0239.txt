of all who ssaould be. adjudged Hereticks by the Bishop, or any other Ecclesi-

their Posterity 3 and that the Ballive should pay two Marks of Silver to any
one that apprehended an Heretick.

And now the Pope laboured with all his Might, to confer a greater Power‘

on the Inquifitors, and to establilh for them a Tribunal, in which they might

fit, and pronounce sentence of Heresy and Heredeks, as Judges delegated‘

from himself, and representing his Person. But to this there were in the Begin·
ning great Obstacles‚ the People not eafily admitting that new Tribunzss, right-

Inquifitors. So that they were very ill looked on by all, even before they·

this Affaz'r was more fully discaffied than at Tholouse„ Afiwwara's, An. 1246,-
there was another Provincial Council at Bsterre, when these Things were more pare—
