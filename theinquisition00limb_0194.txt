In his first Apology for his F light, he speaks to the same Purpose. And,
in the first Place to prevent the Arians imputing these Persecutions to the

seem to do, they are the true Authors of ς or rather, they make themselves the Tools to
execute the Sentence and Malice of the Judges. And afterwards he shews from*

that they must have received it from the Devil, whose Language is, [will pursue and.

Hilarius against Auxentius the Arian, shews, with equal Eloquence, his De-

Nero, Vespafian or Decius, which flourished hy Means of their very Hatred to·-

they maintained themselves by their own Hands and Labours‚ met together in Garrets

to be destitute of Power, fince Ambition is become the ,Means of reconciling Men Atro his
