The HisTonY of the INQUISITION.

Peter de Osma, who read Theological Lectures at Salamanca, had publish’d
a Book, in which were several Things contained contrary to the Dostrines of
the Church of Rome. The Arch-Bishop of fondo, then at Alcala de Henarez,
where he generally refided, did, by Command of Pope Sixtus, after having
consulted the most learned Men, and well confidered the Matter for a long
while, condemn his Opinions, and put the Author himself under the Infamy
of an Anal'oeaena, unless he changed his Sentiments. The Sentence was pro-
nounced June 2 3. Pope Sixtus confirmed the Sentence of the Arch-Bissiop by
a Bull, and commanded him, that he should not omit to proceed against the
Followers of Peter de Ofina, as Hereticks, if they ssmuld refuse or wickedly
defer to abjure this Heresy they are fallen into, or to imitate the said
Peter abjuring his Errors and repenting, as they had imitated him in his
Error.

Cruelty and Severity0 :But he adds, This must be understood with a Grain of Salt,
viz. that this Clemency must not he shewn to an impenitent Heretick 3 for after the
Inquifitors have used all their Endeavours for his Converston, they must by no Means
