his Family, and not to admit into any office, any that should be adjudged
Hereticks by the Inquifitors Sentence 3 and if any of his Number assisted the
Inquifitors‚ they were put under an Oath ofSecrecy. From all which 'tis ma-
nifest, that the Magistrates were not the Companions of the Inquifitors in that
Tribunal‚ but only their Slaves and Tools, The Pope also ordained, that all
Persons should pay towards the Charges of the Jails, Imprisonments, and Sup—
port ofthose who were confined.

By this Means the Office of making Inquisition against Hereticks, was in Waddinp,
diverse Places of Italy committed both to the Minors and Predicant F riars. a. 1254?
But least their mutual power, and the neighbouring Jurisdiction of the Placesss ⁷·
should create Confufion, or raise Disputes about their respective Bounds, the
Pope recalled all the Commiffions that had been granted in the Affair os the
F aith3 and divided, in an exa& Proportion, to each Order, the several Parts
of Italy. The Friars Minors he appointed in the City of Rome, throughout
Tuscany‚ in the Patrimony of St. Peter, the Dutchy of Spoletto, Campania,
Maretamo and Romania. To the Predicants he affigned Lambardy‚ Romaniola‚
the Marquisate of Yarvz‘fino, and Genava. The Bull in which he commits the
Office of the Inquifition to the Predicants‚ is in Bzovius, An. 1 2 54. §. 4. and that
to the Minors, in Luke Wadding, An. 1254. §. 7. After this, the Pope pre-
scribed thirty one Articles to the Magistrates, Judges and People of the three
Countries‚ which he had subjeeted to the Jurisdidfion of the Predicants,
which he commanded to be exaffly observed, and register’d amongst the pub-
lick Records; and gave Power to the Inquifitors to put under Excommunica-
tion and Interdict, all who refused to observe them. Armed with this Pow-
er, they sometimes very insolently abused it, and attempted to introduce into
other Countries what the Pope had order’d only for those that he had put
under their particular Jurisdiffion. Uponathis Account‚ in the Year 1255. Bzovius
there was a great Qarrel between Anselm‚ a Predicant Friar in the Milaneze, a. 1256'.
and the Magistrate of Genava. The F riar endeavoured, that some Constitu· §- 7·
tions made against Hereticks‚ both by the Apostolick See, and the Irn-
perial power, should be published, and repofited amongst the Laws of the
City. But Philip Turrianus, Prefect of the City, refused it, either because
he favoured Hereticks, or despised the Commands of the Inquifitor. Upon
this the Friaro supported by the Apostolick Authority, proceeded against
Philip as suspested of Heresy ε and because he refused to obey and appear,
excommunicated him, and all his Companions in the Governmeffi, as Ac-

for the Deterrnination of the whole Affair. The Pope suspended the Curses Histsson,

against all Contraveners.
