The H1 sroRY of the INQUISITION.

suspeEted, and cited to answer concerning the Faith‚ doth not appear, he be.

demned as an Heretlck.

C H A P. XII.
Of Pefybns defamedfhr HERESY.

ΗΟ they are that are defamed for Heresy‚ we are taught by the
Councilof Tholouse. Cap. 16. Such ought to be accozmted defamed, who
are tried out against by publick Regma, or of whofh Dcfamation among st good and

grave Persam there is legal Proof before the Bishop of the Place. So that to the

perfect P'roofof such Defamation or Infamy for Heresy, two good and grave
'Witneffessuffice But is they are vile and insanimus, although they are not
to be despised on this Account, so as to stop proceeding to an Inquifition
from what they depose‚ yet such Defarnation is not fully proved by them.
They say als0‚ that 'tis not necessary that the Witneffes should hear this
Infamy from the same prudent and discreet Persons ·, but 'tis sufficient, though

{fgfflfffi they hear it from different. And they give this Reason for it 3 because as they

are only to prove Infamy, 'tis sufficient if the Witneffes agree in and concern-
ing this Matter. Yea, they teach farther‚ that ’tis not neceffary that the
&Vitneffes should agree as to the Causes of their own Knowledge. So that
if the Witnesse3 should say, they know this Infatny‚ because they have heard
of it, they are not bound to prove they have heard it·, nor is it required that
one Witness should agree with the other as to Time and Place‚ and the Cau-
l'es of their Knowledge. Because the Qestion is not about these Things‚ but
only concerning the Fame and Infamy. So that tho' they appear singular in
what they say, their Assertion shall be abided by.

When once this Infamy is proved by W'itnesseS, they enquire, whether the
Person inquisitedcan prove himself to be of good Reputation‚ and thus put
a Stop to the inquisition concerning the Truth of the Crime, and take away
the Proof of h;s bad Characler. Here the Popish Doc'tors greatly differ.
Some say, that the Proof concerning his good Charafter, ought not to be ad-
mitted, because it seems to be elufive. For if an hundred Persons should say
such an one hath a bad Characten and a thousmdthat heis ofa good one, the
Psoos ofthe good one doth not discharge him, because he still remains infamous
in the Account of others, and the Inquifition is to be made in reg-ard of thern.
Others say, that the Report of the greatest Number is to be stood to, O-
thers, that the Proofis to be admitted, but whether it affects the contrary
Psoof depends upon confidering wherein the publick Report agrees, what is
tlte Quality of the Witneffes and Persons‚ according to which the Judge is
