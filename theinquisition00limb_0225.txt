she mean while, he who is the principal Peffim amongfl them, either as to Riches ον
Dignim takes in his Hand one or more Loaves, according to the Numbor of [hose thar
areprefhnt 3 andsaying, The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all
always 3 he breaks the Loaf or Loaves, and distributes to all thatfit down, whither
they are Puritans‚ or only their Believers. Ami in this they differ from the poor
Men ofLyons ε for they perform this C ereinony or Bleffing, only once in a Y ear.

Of the Valdenfi’s, Eymericus thus writes, P. 3. Num. 112. ‘Those among them
that are Perfebi, put in the upper Part of the Shoe or Zabbata, a Sort of a
Estutheon‚ as a Sign, from which they are called Inzabbatati. They have one
among them, stiperior to the rest, whom they call ‚Majoralis or Elder, to whom
alone, and to no other, they yield Obeclience. When they stt at T able they hless in thir
issanner: He who blessed the five Barly Loaves and two Fishes‚ in the De»
sart, to his DiscipleS, bless this Table to us. And when they rise, they repeat
thos} Words of the Revelation3 Blesffig, and Honour, and Wisdorn, and
Thanks, and Glory, and Strength, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen„
Always holding their Eyes and Hands lift up to Heaven. This Account is agree-=
able to what we read of the Valdenſss, in the Book of Sentences of the Thou-
loufi· Inquifition‚ but much more explicite and distinet.

The same Eymericus, Num. 88, &c. charges these Hereticks, of his Time,
with many Equivocations and Tricks‚ by which they endeavour to deceive
the Inquifitors, when they interrogate thern concerning their Faith, viz. Is
they are asked, Do you believe the Sacrament of Baptism neceffary to Salvation ·, they
answer·‚ I believe. By which, they mean their own private Faith, and not their
believing the Dostrine they are asked about: Or, zf it pleases Goel, l believe well ;
meaning, that it is not pleafing to Goel, that they should believe as the Inquisitors
would have them: Or, by returning the Qestion. Sir, How do you believe ἓ And
when the Inquifitor answers, I believe the Faith of the Church of Rome, they reply,
J believe so ; meaning, that they believe the Inquisitor believes as he fizys 3 not that
they believe as he eloth. These and other like Things he affirms that he obser-
ved, during the Administration of his Office.

I have been the longer on this Account of the Albigenfhs and Vddenfts, that
every one may judge whether they were one or ‘two different Sedis. To speak
my own Mind freely, they appear to me to have been two distinet ones; and ·
that they were entirely ignorant of many Tenets‚ that are now ascribed to
thern. Particularly the Valdenses seem to have been plain Men, of mean Ca-
pacitieS‚ unsszilful and unexperiencedv3 and if their Opinions and Customs
were to be examined without Pte-judice, it would appear, that amongst

all the modern Seets of Christian-s, they bare the greatest Resemblance to
that of the Memnonites„
