five Signs ‘m these Words. ‘s he Favourers of Hereticks may eafily be known by theste
five very probahle Marks. First, Whoever privately vifit them, whilst in Custody,
and whzsper with them, and gives them V ittuals, are fiispee‘z'ed of being their Disci-
ples and Favourers. Secondly, W hoever greatly lament their Apprehenston or Death‚
seem to have been their spiritual Friends whilst they lived ς for 'tisscarce credible that
any Persttn can be a long while intimate with an Heretick, and not know his
Secrets. Thirdly, Such who complaia that they are unjustly condemned, afterv they
have been openly convineat, or have confeffi’d their Heresy, it appears that they ap-
prove their Sett, and think the Church hath erred in condemning them. Fourthly,
Such who look with a bitter C ountenance upon those who perfiecute Hereticks‚ or preach
&ingemutius{22552:522niffen&§licenciati51>eudemi
greatly to he suspec‘ted, that they hate those against whom their Heart appears to befh
einer, as their Countenance betrays, and love those for whose Destruttion they so much
grieve. Fifthly, If any are found to have by Stealth gothered together in the Night the
Bones of Hereticks burnt, as Reliques, ’tis not to be doubted hut that they reverence
them as Saints, whose Bones they lay up as a kind of S anti‘uary, and are therefore equally
Hereucks with them. Because no one accounts an Heretick for a Saint, but he who
believes his Set} to he holy‚ and is equally an Heretick with him. ‘These Things give
great Presumption of Heresy against him, altho’ it be not sufficient Proof to condemn
him, unless there concur other Arguments‚ hy which it manifestly appears they
did the aforesaid ‘Things in Favour of Heresy.

Of the Hinderers ofthe Office ofthe INQJIS ITION.

H E Hinderers of the Office of the Inquifition come nearest to the Fa-
vourers ofHereticks, and are usually reckoned amongst them.

That this Office may be vigoroussy exercised‚ and that no Hereticks may
escape the Rigour of it, all are strictly commanded, of whatsoever Dignity

the Busmess of the Inquifition‚ and yield all Countenance and Help to the

π. tr. stianae, commands all Arch Bishops, Bishops, and other Prelates. Since there-
fore there are certain Predicant Friars appointed by the Apostolick See, Inquisttors
against Hereticks in the aforesaid Provinces, that they may carry on the Bustneſs 01)ss thkeJ
