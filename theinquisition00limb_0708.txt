Ἰ be condemned, that the Heirs of the Dead, or any other Possess‘ors of their
liffeets, may be deprived of them by the Fiscal·, and finally, that the dead
Bodics may be taken up, cast out os holy Ground and burnt, as ’tis deter-
mined by the first Instrustion of Seville‚ An. 1484. c. 20.

This Aetion against the Dead, when carried on in order to the Confisca-
tion oi their Effeets, is said to last for 40 Years. Thus ’tis determined, cap. 2,
ᾗ. 1. de praescript. l. 6. That the Effeets of deceased Hereticks shall be the Catho-
hcl< Childrens and Heirs by Prescription‚ at the End offorty Years‚ if so be they
have possessed them bona fide. The same is determined by the Instruffiw os Se-
vim, An. 1484. cap. 2-0. Now the Children and Heirs of the Deceased shall then
be said to have poffessed his Effects bona fide, when, at t'ne Time of his Death‚ and
sor the whole Space of forty Years they have believed and understood that the
Person deceased died a Catholick. But ifwithin these forty Years they have atany
time been informed that he died an Heretick‚ they shall never plead Prescription,
because from that time they began to be in malafide3 and iftherefore they have
been thus in Poffeffion ofthem‚ malafide, the Fiscal of the Office of the Inquisi-
stion shall s eize on such Effeets even after forty Years. As to what regards the
Condemnation ofthe Memory ofthe Dead, such an Action is never hindred or
determined by any intervalsof Time. For even when 40 Years and more are
elapsed‚ the Inquifitors may, when ever ’tis discovered and legally proved that
any one died an Heretick‚ carry on an Aetion against him to condemn his Me-
m ory, and declare him to have diedexcommunicated‚ and to forbid any one from

¹neither lawful to have it with him when he is dead. But altho’ the Children
escape this Confiscation of their Estates, if they have been in Poffeffion of
them bona fide for forty Years‚ they incur however the other Penalties which
the Laws have decreed to the Children of the Condemned‚ viz. Infamy and
Incapacity for all publick Offices and BeneficeS.

F ormerly a F ather was-presumed to die in Heresy‚ when fick on his Bed,
he defired Consolation from any one of the Albigenfi‘s by Impofition of Hands.
And therefore 'twas customary for Children‚ to prevent their being excluded
from their Patrimony‚ to object that their Parents were not in their Senses
when ⁴they defired that Consolation. Hence arose a Qestion, whether such
an Excuse ought to be admitted.

'Tis decided, cap. Filii, de haerete 1. 6. The Children or Heirs of those, who,
when on their Death—heds have defired Hereticks to comfort them, that they might re-
ceive the Consolation from them by Impofitz'on of Hands, according to their most
wicked Custom, and thus go the Way ofall Plesh, ought not to be admitted to prove,
that such deceased Persons received this Consolatiom or more truly this Desolation,
when the>v were not of a found Mind, or aster they lost their Speech‚ stnce, as ’tis
said, 'tis their Custom never to constilefizch a one who is not in his Seiises, and hath
not his ordinary Memmy, if whilst they lived they were defamed for Heresy‚ or
sitspebted, or if it legally appears that, being in their Senses, they defiredsuch Here-
‘tick50 In other Cases the aforcfhid C hildren or Heirs may be admitted to prove the Pre-
