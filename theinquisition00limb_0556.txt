cause he came of himself, without being called on, and within the Time of
Grace.

Pegnam. some sorttof Proof may bave preceded, they must not be proved to be Here·
lm· ticks·, for those who are ready to be corrested, must by no Means be reckoned
amongst Hereticks. From these Things they infer, that if any one confeffoe
that he bath done certain Jewifh Ceremonies, or those of any other Sest, up-
on the account of some Profit to himself, he' is not to be accounted an He·-
retick. This sometimes is the Case of Captives, whO, without any other In-
tention, but that of their being better freed from their Captivity, externally
deny the Faith. San Vincente the Inquisitor tells us, That he sawa certain
Person who wanted to satisfy his lustful Desires upon a Woman, who was
one of the newly converted Saracens. She promised to lie carnally with him,
if he would first perform a Ceremony os their Ξεὲὶ, called Gaodoc. He, tho’
anr old Christian, in order to gratify bis lewd Inclinations‚ did it, but imme-
diately went and voluntarily confessed it, adding that he had no other evil
Intention. After consulting the supream Senam, he was absolved‚ An. 1618.
A Case may however happen, ⁴when a Person who makes a voluntary Con-
fersfiom may be obliged to abjure vehemently. A certain new Christian of
the Saracens being driven from Spain, was afterwards taken by the Christian&
He immediately accused himself, that wnilst he was amongst the Moors, he
did sorne Ceremonies and Aets of the MahometanSth, denying an evil Inten-
tion therein. ‘But as some of these Things seemed to the Inquifitor entirely
¹voluntary, viz. bis marrying an Infidel Moorifh Wornan for his Wife, with·
out any V iolence, or any other Advantage, he examined his Fellow—Cap·
- tives·, and when it was proved that he made his Confeffion thro' Fear of
Proof, it was determined that he should abjure as vehement‚ which Deter-
mination pleased the supream Council. But when this very Criminal had
been kept in Custody a few Days‚ in order to his confeffing the whole Truth,
he made the Confeffion defired, and was reconciled in F orm.

However, such as corne voluntarily, are far from escaping all Punissnnent‚
’ but are either treated kindly at the Pleasure of the Inquifitor, according to
the Quality of their Persons and Crimes, or else condemned to pay a Fine, or
, give Alms, or some such Works of Charityo But if they wait till they are
accused‚ denounced, cited or apprehended‚ or suffer the Time of Grace to ssip
over, they are pronounced unworthy of it.

And in this Case many fooliIhly deceive themselves with a salse opinion,
·'believing, that because F avour is promised to such who appear voluntarily,
they shall be free from all Punishment ·‚ because they ate only saved frorn the
more terrible ones, it being left to the Pleasure of the Inquisitors to infliet
some penitential Punishment on them, according to the Nature os their

Consalv. Crime‚ as will appear from the following Instance. “ There was at the
