we read thus: By the Μενε)1 of Almighty God, and confiding in the Authority of his

'1V„ beginning, Prcc’ cunetis. And to you who lahour in this Affair, we grant you
that Paridon of Sins which was granted in a general Council, to thost· who succour the

postles, Peter and Paul, by that Power of binding and loostng, which God hath con·

Ecause the Inquifitors are Judges delegated by the Pope in the Cause of
