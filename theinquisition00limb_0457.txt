3 Sometimes this Punishment of Burning is heightned by another kind of
Cruelty. In Spain and the Netherlands, lest they should speak to the Speffl1<

tors when brought to the Stake, and pioussy testify their Constancy, they

’ were gagged with an Iron Instrument, so that in the Midst of their Tor,

ments they could utter only an inarticulate Sound. Thus also Simancas pro-

nounces‚ ff hat obstinate H ereticks fhould be burnt alive, and be brought to the &dedit-48. §.6;

gagged, that they mayn't offend the little ones. This Muzzle or Gagg the Spani-

ards in their Language call Mordaza. And if they could invent any Thing

more terrible, they would not fail to use it against Hereticks. This Carenatit, 13·

testifies, affirming that the Custom of punishing Hereticks with Fire is most §. 1.Num05

reasonable, because Burning is the most terrible Deam, and therefore the most grie· 7.

vous of all Crimes ought to be punished with it ·, so that {f any szishment more ter„

rible than this could be found out, it ought to be infliHed on Hereticks 3 and also be-=

¹ cause by this Means the Heretick and his Crime is more speedily blotted out from the

' Remembrance eff Mankind.

 

Thus we see that there is no kind of Punishment that can poffibly be ine
vented, but is emeted against Hereticks, and that greater Gentleness is used
towards Thieves, Traytors and Rebels, those Enemies of Mankind, than too
wards miserable Heretick53 who endeavouring to worship God with a pure
Conscience, and regulare their Lives by the Gospel Rule, yet oppose some
Doctrines ofthe Church of Rome, which they are persuaded are contrary to
the Gospe13 and that it is a much more grievous Offence in that Church, to
oppose certain Opinions by the clear Light of the Word of God, and to re-²
je& certain Pharisaical Superstitions‚ than openly to contemn the divine Com-
mands by an impious and profane Life, and vilely to dishonour the most holy

Name of God„

 

C H A P. ΙΙΙ.
Of Open and Secret HERETICKS.

Ereticks are divided into several Claffes in the Church of Rome, and this
is very neceffary for the Instruffion ol the Inquisltors, that they may
always certainly know what Sentence to pronounce upon each. However,
= every Thing is not so fully determined, but that there yet remain great Con-
troverfies amongst the Doctors and Inquisitors themselves, so that one of thern
often judges more favourably than another 3 and therefore 'tis of great Con-
cern by what Inquifitor any Person is to be judged ·, for he who happens to be
condemned as an Heretick by a severe one, might have obtained a milderSen-
tence‚ had he been tried by a Judge of more favourable Sentiments and O-
Puigfflssof all Hereticks are divided into Open and Secret. “ An open He· Eymer,
