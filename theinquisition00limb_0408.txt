English Persons who were on board, observing in them certain Marks of
Evangelical Piety, and of their having received the best Instruffion, and
threw them into Jayl. In that Ship there wasaChild‚ ten or twelve Years‚
at most, old, the Son of a very rich English Gentleman, to whom, as was
reported, the Ship and principal Part of her Loading belonged.. Amongst
others they took up also this Child. The Pretence was, that he had in

Sliip with all its Cargo was confiscated, and the ,Child, with the other
PrisonerS, were carried to the Jayl of the Inquisltion at Seville, where he
lay s1x or eight Months. Being kept in so strait Confinement for so long
a while, the Child, who had been brought up tenderly at home, fell into

they ordered him to be taken out of the Jayl‚ and carried, for the Recoss

became of him afterwards. In the mean while 'twas wonderful, that the
Child, in so tender an Age, gave noble Proofs how firmly the DoCtrine
of Piety was rooted in his Mind; ostenrimes, but especially Morning and

the same Jayl, who had voluntarily abjured the Mahometcm Impiety, and
came but a little before from Morocw, a famous City of Mauritania, and
Capital of the Kingdom, into that Part of Spain which lies direffly over
