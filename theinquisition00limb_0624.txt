C H A P. XXIV.
Of the APPEALfrom the ·1NQ1s1r0n.

n.121,&0. Nother Exception against the Judge iS, to appeal from the Inquifitor.

com. 31· For altho' the Emperor Frederick, inl. Commzffi nobis, §. 7. decrees,
‘Thatall Benefit of Proclamation and Appeal shall be wholly denied to Hereticks,
their Receivcrs and Favourers, yet sometimes such Appeal is allowed to the
Person accused. However‚ Hereticks are allowed no Appeal from a defini-
tive Sentence, because no one is definitively condemned for Heresy, unless one
tharhath confessed it, or who hath been legally convieted, according to the
Laws of the Inquifition ·‚ and from such definitive Sentences there can be no
Appeal, in· favour of the Faith, and out of Hatred to Hereticks, least Judg-
ment should be protracled. Cap. Ut Inquifitionis, de haeret. l. 6. But an inter-
locutory Sentence is a quite different Thing‚ and from this Criminals are al-
lowed to appeal, when they think they have been unjustly dealt with.

Decathd. Simancas confirms the same. ‘⁶ Hereticks can’t appeal from a definitive

17²st- ἢὸ· “ Sentence, tho' they may from all interlocutory Sentences, isit doth not yet

9' 3· “ appear that the Criminals are Hereticks. So that ifa Criminal be condemn-
“ ed to the Torture, or to Purgation‚ or to be bastinadoed, or to a Fine,
“ he may appeal, because it doth not appear that he is an Heretick‚ but only
“ suspe&ed·, nor doth he appeal from the Law, but from the Judges, who
5‘ have pronounced Sentence according to their Pleasure.'' a

This Appeal must confist of two Parts. The Grievance which the Crimi-

nal affirms he lies under, and the Plea by which such Grievance is proved.
Notab. 18, But here Bernard Cvmmsts, in his Light of the Inquisttors, observes, Voc.
19· Appellatio, ‘⁶ Tha: he who offersa probable Reason, must be prepared to
‘⁶ prove it, to name the Witneffes by which he intends to prove it, and to
“ have them ready3 because otherwise those who make these Exceptions,
“ would have it in their Power to a& fraudulently, which would be the Case
“ of all who would not have their Exceptions rejected, to give needless Trou-
Ncmb.20.“ ble to the Accuser. He adds, that when such an Appeal from an interlo->
“ cutory Sentence is put in, with the Reason specified‚ and a Protestation for
Νοῑαῦ· ¹5·“ the Affigning of other Reasons‚ such an Appeal cannot be afterwards sup-
“ ported by such Reasons in Reserve, because the very Protestation it self of
“ affigning them, would be of no Strength or Obligation. Nor canit be
“ suppos’d that any one would have the ]udge pay any Regard to such Appeal,
“ unlessit appears to the Judge that the Appeal is valid. So that if he doth
“ not believe it to be good, he need not pay any Regard to it''.

Some Grievances are capable of being remedied. As if the Inquifitor ,should
not admit the accused Person to make his Defence, or hath fingly, and by
himself, without the Bishop or Vicar commanded him to be put to the Que-
stion. Other Grievances are irreparable‚ as if he hath aelually made him
undergo the Torture. And therefore when the accused Person alledges the

Grievances,
