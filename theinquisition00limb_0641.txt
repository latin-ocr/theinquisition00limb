This is particularly the Decree ofthe Council of Narbomze, Cap. 1 1. Ami as to
those who, after Abjurution or Purgation of their Error, shall be semu? lo have
returned to the Error they have abjured, leave them to the sesular Jmssgmmt
without any further Hearing, to receive their due PunssJ-s-nem. For 'tis emugr')
that they have once deceived the Church by cz fab} Canzref‘y'iom efsneeiazb'y

where there is a very great Number of them, &C- At‘tho’ if they are penituit,
Penance is by no Meam to be denied them. But this properly takes place

when any one is vehemently defamed for Heresy. An Infamy is said [ο be
vehement‚ when any one hath been oftentimes‚ or in many Places marked

with Infamy, amongst good Men, or hath on this account been excluded

their Company, and when there arise any Signs or Suspicio-ns increasmg the
Infamy of the Heresy, or if after any grievous Offence committed, ‘0in the
destroying the Images of the Saints, the burning of Churches, the Profana-

tion of the Sacraments, and the like, any one is immediately looked upon as
infamOUS. Butif he falls into any other Heresy, from which he had not
purged himself before, he is not accounted as a Relapse.

If he humbles himself in his Purgation, and will submit to Penance,83n÷anc.
heis to be admitted, and not deliver’d over to the secular Coun, unless het: 50·
happens to be a Relapse ς for if a convicted Heretick ις received when peni· 9· 16'
tent, much more is this Benefit of the Church to be granted to him who
is convieted only by a kind of Presumption and feigned Proof.

’Tis a Custom amongst many Inquifitors, that a Criminal vehementlyff 17.
suspefted shall be first tortured, and afterwards forced to purge himself if he
confessas nothing. After this, when he is purged, he is obliged also to ab·
jure, and after his Abjuration punished with other arbitrary Punishments. But ς, 13.
others think it very unjust, that any one should be condemned to several Pu-
nishments for a single Crime, and inasmuch as every one of these Punilhments ς. ιο.·
is sufficient to purge away any Suspicions, ’tis, without doubt, needless and
unjust, that a suspected Criminal should be made to undergo many.

But as this Purgation depends wholly on the Pleasure of other Persons, itPegna,

l is avery deceitful and uncertain Thing, and therefore {hould not easily be in· in Direff·

joined Criminals by the Inquifitors. Thus the Madrid Instrustion, An. 1561124- com.

 

cap. 47. Canonical Purgation is, thro’ the chedneſs of Men, a very dangerous
Remedy, especially in these Times, and therefore ’tis not much used, and must there-
’ fore be seldom praetised, and with great Caution. Hence Simancas judges, thart-it· 5⁶·
those who are born of Jewish or Moorifh Parents, must not be compelled t09· ¹·
this Purgation, because it would be the same Thing as to throw them di·
rectly into the Fire. For who doth not think ill of them, or at least doubt
of their Innocence? And therefore he thinks it would be better to compe!
thern by Abjuration‚ Torments, or arbitrary Punishments. But if they are
at any time condemned to this Purgation, and they can’t procure such Corn-

purgators as are required, others a} to be admitted, tho' not altogethcrfiso
