If when he appears, and doth not prove any legal Impediment, but only9« 3
his Innocence as to the Heresy for Suspicion of which he was cited, altho’ ³
he is to be absolved from the Heresy, yet he is to be tortured to discover
his Intentioffi upon account os a vehement Suspicion of his Contempt of
the Keys of the Church, and must abjure as one vehemently suspected. If
neither a legal Impediment nor his Innocence appear, he is to be dealt with

some Penances are to be enjoined him, and he may be condemned, according
to the Nature of his Crime, to more grievous Punishments, and especially
pecumary ones.
