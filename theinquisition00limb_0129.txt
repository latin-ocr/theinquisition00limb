The INTRODUCTION. 103

It would be well worth the while of some of these Council-mongers to
lay down some proper Rules and Distinetions‚ by which we may judge what
Councils are to be received, and which to be reje&ed; and particularly why
the four first General Couneils should be submitted to in Preference to all
others. Councils have often decreed contrary to Councils‚ and the same Bi-
shops have decreed different Things in different Couucils3 and even the third
and fourth General Councils determined the Use of the Word P E R S O N,
in an infinitely different Seul'e from what the two first did. Heretical couneus,
as they are called, have been more in Number than some Otthodox gene-
ral ones, called by the same imperial Authority, have claimed the same
PowerS‚ pretended to the same Influence of the Holy Ghost, and prououueed
the same Anathemas against Principles and Persons. By what Crito-sia or
certain Marks then must we judge, which of these Couneils are fflieving,
general, particular, orthodox‚ lieretical, and which not? The Councils
themselves must not be Judges in their oxi-n Cause 3 for then we must re-

-ceive, or rejeci them all. The Charae'ters of the Bishops that compostel

them will not do, for their Charaelers seem equally amiable and Christian
on each fide. The Nature of the DoGtrine‚ as decreed Ay them, is far from
being a safe Rule3 because, if human Authority‚ or Church vaer makes
Trufh in any Case, it makes it in every Case3 and therefore, upon this Foot
the Decrees at ‘Ere and Ephesus, are as truly binding as those at Nice
and Chalcedon. Or,'if we must judge of„the Councils by the Nature of
the Doetrine‚ abstrafled from all human Authority, those Councils
can have no Authority at all. Every Man must fit in Judgment over
them, and try them by Reasou and Scripture, and reje& and receive them,
just as he would do the Opinions of any other Persons whatsoever. And, I
humbly conceive, they should have no better Treatment, because they de-
serve none.

V. If then the Decrees of Fathers and Coum-ils, if the Decifrons of hurum
Authority in Matters of Religion, are of nc avan, and carry with them no
Obligarion, it follows, that the impofing Subscriptions to Creeds aud Arti-
cleS of Faith, as Tests of Orthodoxy, is a Thing unreasonable' iu it selas,
as it hath proved ofinfinite ill Consequence in the Church of God-

Ι call it an unreasonable Custmn, not only because where there is no Poxver
to make Creeds for others, there can be no Rig'ut to impose thet-113 but be-
cause no one good Reason can be affigued for the Use and Continuance of
this Praffice. For, as my Lord Biihop of London admirably well explains this
Matter‚ As long as fifen are Men, and have differem Degrees of Πικηένβιιῑιείῐῐις,Βςζῗνρ εἴ
