out the Truth‚ and ifhe finds that the Witneffes are justly charged with mot-
tal finmsty, he must consult the Laws, Doc‘tors and Counsellors, and then
a& as he sees fit.

The fifth is, to give the Person accused a Copy of the Process, suppressing
the Names ofthe Deponents, so that when he sees the Deposition5‚ he may
conjetfture who it was that deposed so and so against him. On this sometimes
he names several as his mortal Enemies, affigning the Reasons ofit‚ and pro-
ducing his Witneffes. If he gueffes at any, the inquisitor enquires the Causes
of the Enmity·‚ if they are not sufficient, he rejths them; if they are, he
examines the Witneffes privately, who, upon not giving legal Proof are re·
jebted. This is performed with the Advice of the Learned. And this Me-
·thod is generally observed.

The fixth is, that when the Person accused says, upon giving him a Copy
ofthe Process‚ that he hath many mortal Enemies, names them, and affigns
the Reasons of such Enmity‚ the Diocesan and Inquifitor hold a Council of
‚Divines and Lawyers, cause the whole Process to be read over by the Notary‚
discover to them the Names ofthe Witneffes and Deponents, and oblige them
by Oath‚ or under Penalty ofExcommunication, not only to give found Ad-
vice, but also to observe perse& Secresy. After this 'tis debated amongst
them, whether they fully know the Person accused, and the Witneffes‚ and
whether there is mortal Enniity between them? If they fully know them,
their Counsel and Advice is stood to, and whosoever are adjudged by them
to be mortal Enemies, are rejedted from giving Evidence 3 and those who are
adjudged not to be so, are admitted. If the Counsellors do not fully know
the Person accused and the Witneffes‚ two, three or four Persons of Reputa-
tion, well acquainted with the Criminal, are chosen by their Advice, out of
the City, where the accused Person dwelt. One of these at least, or tvm,
must be Parish-Priests, and another, if it can conveniently be, a Religious, and
the others Layicks‚ reputable Men, zealous for the Truth. These are secretly
called together by the Biihop and lnquifitor, and being obliged to speak the

Truth by Oath, or under Penalty of Excommunication‚ are interrogated, con-

aster they have well and carefully considered the Matter amongst themselves,
they rejeet from being Evidences such as these Persons say and prove to be the
Accuseds mortal Enemies, and admit these which they say are not. This is
the usual Method, and seems to agree with the Determination of the Council of
Biterre, Cap. 10. But let Care be taken of this, as the Apostolick See hath carefully
delernzined, that the Names qf the Witneffi’s be not discovered by any An or Word.
But if the Perstm, under Inquzfition, inststs on it, and says that poffibly he may have
Enemz'es‚ or that some Persons have conspired against him, let the Nam& offitch E-
nemies or Conspirators, and the Occafion and Truth of such Enmities and Conspiractes
beso drawn out of him, as that the Safety of the PVitncff’s, and the Persons αζΙὸ to be
con-vinea, may be provided for.
