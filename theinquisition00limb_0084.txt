³· 7-Jud.2. adored. And elsewhere he declares, That [mages and PiHures in Churches, were
{1³40st very useful for the Instruinon of the Ignorant, who could not read. Sergius, after
mm· this, repaired the Images of the Apostles. John Vll. adorned a great many
Churches with the Pictures and Images of the Saints. And at length, in the
Reign ofth'lippiczts, Constantine the Pope, in a Synod held at Rome, decreed‚
That Images should be fixed up in the Churches‚ and have great Adoration
paid them. He also condemned and excomniunicated the Emperor himself for
Heresy ·, because he erased the Pietures ofthe FatherS, which had been painted ’
on the Walls of the Church of St. Sophia at Constantinople3 and commanded,
that his lmages should not be received into the Church 3 that his Name should
not be used in any publick or private Writings, nor his Effigies stamped upon
any kind ofMoney whatsoever.

This Superstition of bringing Images into Churches was warmly opposed, and⁵
gave Occasion to many Disturbances and Murders. The Emperor Leo Isaurus
greatly dis-approved this Praeiiee, and published an Edi& by which, he com-st
manded all the Subje&s of the Roman Empire‚ to deface all the Pifmres, and
to take away all the Statues of the Martyrs and Angels out of the Churches,
in order to prevent Idolatry, threatning to punish those who did not, as publick‘
EnemieS. Pope Gregory ΙΙ. opposed this EdiCt, and admonished all Catho-
licks, in no m .nner to obey it. This occasioned such a· Tumult aze-Ravenna*
in Italy, between the Partisans of the Emperor and the Pope, as ended in the
Morder of Paul, Exarch of Italy, and his Son ·‚ which enraged the Emperor in
an high Deg¹ ee·‚ so that he ordered all Persons to bring to him all their Ima·
ges of VVood, B ass and Marble, which he publickly burnt 3 punishing with
Deam, all such as were found to conceal them. He also convened a Synod at
Constantt'nopl83 where, after a careful and full Examination, it was unanimous·
ly agreed, that the Interceffion of the Saints was a meer F able 3 and'the Wor-
ship of Images and Relffls was downright Idolatry, and contrary to the Word·
os God. And as aermonus, Patriarch of Constantinople, favoured Images, the
Emperor banished him, and substituted Annianus, who was of his own
Platin· Sentirnents, in his Room. Gregory 111. in the Eeg‘nning of his Pontificate‚

ass'embled his Clergy, and by their unanimous Consent, deposed him on this·-
Account, from the Empire, and put him under Excomrnunication 3 and was
the first who witi-,drew the Italians from their obedience to the Emperors of
Constantinosle, calling in the Affistance of Charles King of France. After this,
he placed the Images oi Christ and his Apostles in a more sumptuous Man-
ner than they were before upon the Altar ofSt. Peter, and at his own Ex-
pence, made a golden Image of the Virgin Mary, holding Christ in her Arms,
for the Cameli ofSt. Illary ad Proesepe.

Constantine Copronymus, Leo’s Son and Succeffor in the Empire, inherited his
Father’s Zeal against the Worship of Images, and called a Synod at Con an-
tinople, to determine the Controversy. The Fathers being met together, to
the Number of 330, aster confidering the Do<strine of Scripture‚ and the
Opinions of the F‘athers, decreed‚ Thac every Imago, of whatsoever Materials
made and formed by the Artist, fhould be cast out of the Christian Churrh as a strange Θ
and aboifzinable Thing 3 adding an Anathema upon all who should make [ilrgzages or

ibium.
