Hence proceeds the Maxim, that Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks‚
which some are not afraid openly to teach·, altho’ those who are more wise
in Gerfnany, France, and the Low Coumries, endeavour to wipe off this Spot
from their Church. But the Spaniards, tho' they can’t be daily charged with
this Perfidiousness, because they have none whom they 6311 Hereticksliving
amongst them, yet affert it in plain and open Words, without diffembling,
and are not afhamed to defend and confirm it by the Praetice of the
