that Hereticks hold private Conventicles‚ if he goes to them but once, he will
incur the Suspicion os believing them, unless he discovers it to the Bishop or
Inquisitor. Because in this latter Case he is judged to approve what he might
have prevented‚ if he had made a Discovery to the Ecclefiastical Judges, ag
he ought to have done.

Schismaticks have a very near Agreement with Hereticks, and they are thus
distinguiihed by Simancas.

“ Schismaticks are either consummate Hereticks, or near akin to Here-tit, 53,
“ tick8, viz. who only depart from the Unity of the Church, and the obe-5 425·
“ dience of the chief Pontiff. These differ but little from Hereticks. For
“ they believe that there may be Salvation and true Sacraments without the
“ true Church, and many other schismatical Things. These are to be pu·-

“ nistied with almost the same Punilhments as Hereticks themselves.

“ Others are without BIame, and have a just Excuse 3 viz. they who, thr0’§. 90
‘³ probable or insuperable Ignorance, believe a Person to be Pope who is not
‘⁶ rightly ele&ed ·, which sometimes happens upon a doubtful Eleffiffion, when
“ two or more contenti for the Pontificate. One of these may, with a good
“ Faith, be owned for true Pope, though not justly elected? After Simm-
cas hath thus explained the Matter‚ he pronounces a cruel Sentence against
the modern Hereticks‚ i. e. against all in this Age, who live without the Com-
munion oi the Church of Rome, in Germany, ance, the Netherlands, and some
other Northern Countries.

“ The modern Hereticks are not united. There are many Schisms amongst5· 12⁴³
“ them, so that in one House you may find several Belicfs, the Huspand,

“ Wife, Children, and Farnssy, all believing differently.

‘⁶ Against these impious Fanaticks, who endeavour to defile all divine

“ Things‚ the Laws rise up with revenging Fire. These pestiferous Here-§.143
“ ticks are driven out of Spain, who rejeffing all that antient Discipline,
“ which the holy Spirit taught, which so many Ages, the Consent of so ma-
“ ny Nations, so many great Men, famous for their Piety and Learning‚ have
“ delivered down to us, instead of retaining the true Method of *governing
“ the Christian Commonwealffl, throw all T hings into Disorder, and more
“ than Babylonifh Confuston.’'

The Punishments of Schismaticks are Privation of Ecclefiastical Power,Carena<,'
Excommunication, Incapacity for all Offices for the future, and finally Deathtp· ²-- τ· 3,
And the Doctors observe, that when Schismaticks are impenitent‚ the secularff· ¹2·
Judges may in such Case punish them, if Clergymen, without degrading them.
They add, that all Lords and Magistrates, as well Ecclefiastical as Secularffl, 49·
who sall into or raise Schistn, ought to be punilhed likewise with Death ·‚ ac-
cording to the Bul] of Paul IV. beginning, Cum ex Apostolatus officio, in which

first Offence, as the very Relapsed themselves. But if they repent, the Iri-9. 13:
