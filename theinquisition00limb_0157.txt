The DEDJCATJoN,
Hopes and Eyes of all good Meu upon Yon, and for

which You are now an Ornament to Your Profeffion 3 the
great Goodness of Your Minci, so highly becomiug an
Evangelical Pastor, gives a happy Presage to the Refor-
mation., even now in Dauger‚ and lately almost oppressed.
For such is the Integrity of Your Life, such the Simplici,
ty and Candor of your ssehaviour, such Your Charity and
Benevolence to all, such Your Wisdom from long Expe-
rience, that You seem to have been chosen by Divine 'ffro-
vidence, by Your Condust to unite and strengthen the
reformed Chumhoe, to heal- their DifferenceS, and to ad»
vance and defend the Gospel Liberry and Christian Reli-
gion against the Attempts and {hvage Cruelty of the Papists.
For You not only approve, but are a Patrem of true Goo
spel Charity. You oppose the Papal Tyranny and Barba.»
rity, by Purity of Life and Gentleness of Dispofition, the
, very Methods by which Christianity formerly overcume
and> destroyed Idolatry‚ and the Heatheu Impiety and Ty,
sauny, and by which it always will txiumph oves its hue-
mies. Icould not therefore submit this Work to any bue
Your Grace’s Proteffion⁷ and persuade my self You wi'tl
with me judge it to be seasonable 3 especially in this Stat-e
of AffairS, in which the Papacy is eudezwouring³ especially
in Englaml, to ere& it self again, and usurp the sole Doss
minion3 thatin this Treatise all Men may see, as in a
GlasS, its living and genuine Representation, and never
suffer themselves to be deceived by a false and (higuised
Appearance, but acknowledge it to be what it really ia,
viz. an Affemhly and Combination of cruel and b]oo;.³y
Men, who affe& and usurp, whereaeexer they σου,λ a Do»
'minion over Conscience‚ and thus ere& a Kingdom ορμον
