The HtsTORY ofthe INQulsiriom

Raymond‚ also Earl of Τὸοίοῑςκῖ), quite oppreffed with the ‚several M'isfortunes
we have before related, submitted his Neck to the Papa-l Yoke: ·For he fig-
nified to the Pope, that he defired that heretical Pravity might be quite de-
stroy’d‚ and wholly extirpated out of his Dominions. The Pope highly ex-
tolled him for so pious a Zeal·‚ and to oblige him, as 'ne says, commanded
the Bifhop of ΛΞΜ, to make Inquifition after, and punish the Hereticks of
Tholeufh. le'lliam (ie Pado Laurentii, as Rzzynald cites him, relates‚ that Ray-
mom? order’d about eighty Persons‚ who either confesse& or were convicted
of Heresy, in Judgment before him, to be burned with Fire in the City of
Agar, in the Place called Berlczz'gas. But he did not long survive it, dying
in the Year 1249. and was the last Earl of ‘Tholouse of that Line. After his
Death, the Earldom went to his Son-mlaw, the Earl of Peiffiers, and he
dying without Issue, it devolved to the Kings of Frmzce.

The Office of the Inquisition was more than ten Years before this brought
into Lombczrdy. Imzocent IV. An. 1247. willing to establish it, commanded

'Friar John lfa-cutinus, a Predicant, that he ssiould constantly oppose the He-

reticks in Lombcmly, and gave haim Power to absolve those who would abjure
their Heresy, and return to the Church‚ and of granting Indulgencies to such
who would attend upon his Sermons 3 and forbid that any of the Superiors of
the same Order, the Provincial, or Master General, should hinder him in the
Office of the Inquifition‚ or remove him from it.

From the neighbouring Province of Tholouse the purer Doeirine had spread
it self into the Province of Narbonae and Aragon .· Wherefore Innocent IV. in a
Letter‚ sent to Raymond Penniafortz'us‚Master of the Predicants, and to the Pro·
vincial ofSpaz'n, commands that they ffiould depute, by the Pope's own Autho-
rity, some of the Friars of his Order in the Kingdom ofAragon, to be Inqui-
sitors of heretical Pravity, in the Province of Narbonne, in that DistriCt only
>that was subject to James, King of Arag0n3 and enjoin them, that they
,should effectually proceed against Hereticks‚ their Abettors, &a fearing no
one in this Affair, but God, according to the Form published by Gregory‚ and
renewed by himself.

But Luke W'czdding relates, That in the Year 1232. Inquifitors were ap-
pointed in Aragon, by the Command of Pope Gregory IX. the King defiring
them of the Pope, at the Instigation of Raymond Penniafortius, his Confeffor.
Not long after a Synod was held at Tarracon, which made many Decrees
against Heretick33 and an Inquifition was there set up, after the Manner
of that at Tholouse, which was carried on with t=he greatest Rigour against
the Hereticks which arose in that Time, and which lasted more than an
whole Age. For in the Life of Nicholas Eymerick, a Predicant Monk, and
Author of the Directory of the Inquifitors‚ 'tis related, that Eymerick flou-
riafhed in the Times of Urbem V. and Gregory XI. Popes, and of Peter IV. King
of Aragon .· That he was created Inquisitor General about the Year of our
Lord 1358. and succeeded Nicholas Rosell‚ An. 1356. and made a Cardinal:
That he died the 4th of January, An. 139 3. having strenuoussy kept up the

Office of the Inquisition against Hereticks, 44 Years succeffively. Upon his
, 1

Death
