that no one should entertain or feed them 3 and if any one out of Compaffion

did this, he was b‘urnt, with his entire Family.

ξ. 8. 98. Hunerick, the Arian King of the Vandals in Africa, among other Cruelties
he exercised on the Catholicks‚ threw an immense Multitude of them one
upon another, like Heaps of Locusts, into strait and vile Places, where they
had no Conveniency for eafing Nature, but were forced to do it amongst one
another as they lay, so that the Stench and Terror exceeded all other kinds
of Punishments. Victor relates these Things„ who himself was an Eye-wit-¹
ness to them.

3, 7„ The same Vic‘lor relates other kinds of Cruelty praetised by Hunerick ;

⁵ but it would be too tedious to recount them all. 'Tis enough to add, that
some had their Tongues cut out, others their Hands, others their F eet chopt
off ; others their Eyes dug out, and others were miserably ssain through
the Extremity of their Turtures. See also Hisl. Tripart, b. 5. c. 32. and
b. 4. c. .

Austirffilso, in his 50th Epistle to Bonifaoe, and in his 68th Epistle, and in
other Books which he wrote against the Donatists, recounts the various
Cruelties of the Donatists and Circumcellian53 so that the Christians seemed
only to be employed in mutual Butcherings of one another; and acted as
though the whole Perfection of the Christian Life consisted, not in the Ho-
liness of their Manners, but in a bitter and imprudent Zeal 3 so that Ammianus
Marcellinus, an Heathen Writer, describing those TimeS, relates of Julian
the Emperor, b. 22. Thac he ordered the Christian Bishops and People that were
at Variance with each other, to come into his Palace, and there admonished them,
that they should every one profeſs his own Religion, without Hindrance or Fear‚
whilst they did not disturb the publick Peace by their Divzfions3 which he did
for this Reason, because as he knew their Liberty would increase their Divistons,
he might now have nothing to fear from their being an united People ς having found

ians are to eac ot er.

The Eccleslastical Doctors give very pathetick and odious Descriptions of
the Persecutions of the Arians. 'Tis abundantly plain from the Writings of
the Orthodox, which now remain, that their Edists were far from being
vain and harmless Terrors. And if we now had the Writings of the Arium,
we should not probably find softer Things related by them of the Orthodox,
than the Orthodox in their Writings relate of the Arians: But by reason
of the severe Ediets against keeping their Books, their Works are entirely
destroy'd ς and we have now no Remains of the History of those Times but
what we find in the Writings of the Orthodox. And though these were in
some Respefts great Men, yet their Actions and Writings abundantly testify,
that they were far from being free from human Pasfions, Hatred‚ Anger, and
the Study of Revenge 3 especially when they had to do with their AdversarieS,
and those who differed from them in Matters of Religion. This hath been

, . the Unhappiness of all Times, that it is too generally true of Divines‚ what
