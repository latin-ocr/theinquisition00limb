tween Catholicks and Protestants, chosen on each Side for this Purpose.⁴ For
he believed that the Council, and especially that of Trenz‘, had declared ma-
ny Things as Matters of Faith, which did not at all belong to it ·, particular-
ly as to justification and Grace, as an inherent Qality‚ and the Efficacy
of the Sacraments, ex opere operato, and many others. That the Articles·
which he called Fundamental, were such only as were necessary to Salva-
tion, and not such as were controverted between both Parties 3 and that there-
fore he who denied them was not a Member cut off from the Church, but a.
living one, andjoined to it in Faith and Charitys From whence he concluded‚
that notwithstanding this Difference‚ there might be a Union and Agree-t
ment between the Church of Rome and the Protestants. All these Things he
guarded by this Rule, that the holy Scripture, as far as clear and express,v
was an adequate Rule ofFaith, and in Dese& of this, such Tradition as was
certain, and that therefore no Christian Man ought- to believe, with a divine
Favith, any Thing not expressed in holy Scripture without any Obscurity,
and Difference of Catholick Explications ς or not delivered by the Apostles
or Apostolick Men to the Church, without any Ambiguity whatsoever 3 and
that¹ beyond this Rule every Man was free to follow his own Opinion.

When he had answered that he had said and believed these Things, the
Congregation of the Cardinals General Inquifitors thought proper to consult
the Censors of Theological Propofflions, who, examining the Affair before·
the Cardinal of Cremona, unanimoussy pronounced the Propofitions heretica]-⁴
And as there was farther a vehement Suspicion that his Abjuration was seign-
ed, he was interrogated, whether he would perfist in the said Herefies ?‘ He
said, N0; but that he repented of them, and'was ready to detest and abjure'
them, as far as they should be declared Herefies by the Apostolick See,
Whilst his Cause was in'*this State, and during ‘the Time allowed him to make
his Defence‚ and for grantingihim his Process, as he was consulting his Ad-
vocate, he fell into a very grievous Distemper, which so encreased on him,-
that the Phyficians despaired of his Life, and the rather, onaccount of the
Season of·the Year, and the Greatness of his Age, being‘fixty-fix Years olda
He abjured however before the Cardinal of Cremona, and other Officials of
the Inquisition, the'Herefies he had confeffed, and all other33 and having
given Signs of Repentance‚ and received the Sacraments, and sent a Mess'en»
ger to the Pope, to give him Thanks, in these Words, That by the Prefficre
of his Confinement, he had given him Opportunity seriousty to think of the Salvation of
his SouZ, and to behold theLz'ght, which he was too blind to discern before, [md that
therefore he was indebted to him, that by the Mercy of God he died with a good
Hope, after these Things he departed this Life. His Bowels‚ in order tome-
