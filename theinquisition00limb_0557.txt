 

The HlsTonY ofthe INQU1s1T10N. 127

“ Years, who, according to a common Superstition‚ dwelt in a Desm: in a
“ certain Chapel, upon the Account of Religion. Hearing in his Chapel of
“ the great Number of those who were taken up every Day at Sta-ville by the
“ Inquifitors, for what they call the Lutheran Herefies ·, having heard also
“ ofthe Decree of the Inquifitors‚ by which he was commanded, under the
“ Terrors of Excommunication, immediately to discover to the inquisition
“ whatsoever he knew ofthofe Things, either as to others or himself, the
‘⁶ poor stupid Hermit comes to Seville, goes to the Inquifitors and accuses him-

“ self, because he thought the said Inquifitors would use singular Clemency
“ towards those who thus betrayed themselves. His Crime waS, That where-

“ as, being about twenty Years before this at Gema, and hearing a certain
“ Brother of his disputing about a Man’s Justification by Faith in Christ ·, of
“ Purgatory, and other Things ofthe like Nature, he did not wholly condemn
“ them, tho’ he never thought of them afterwards. He therefore aelmow-

“ ledged his Crime, and came to ask Mercy. When the Lords Inquisi-:ors
“ had received his Confeffion, they commanded the poor Hermit to Jayl,

“ where, after a long Confinement‚ he was brought out in publick Proces-

“ lion, and was sentenced to wear the Sanbenito, to three Years Imprison-
.“ ment, and the Forfeiture of his Effetffts.''

’ Sometimes also they usea certain Stratagem to draw Persons to a volun- Ibam,
tary Appearance before the Inquifitors. ‘⁶ When they have apprehended
“ any remarkable Person, who hath been the Teacher of others, or who
“ they know hath been resorted to by many otherS‚ upon account of his
‘⁴ Doctrine and Learning, as being a Teacher and Preacher of great Re-

“ pute; 'tis usual with them to cause a Report to be spread amongst the
“ People, by their Familiars, that being grievoussy tortured‚ he had disco-
“ vered several of those that had adhered to him, suborning some Persons
“ out of the neighbouring Prisons, to affert that they heard his Cries amidst
“ his Tortures, in order to give the greater Credit to the Report, These
“ Reports are spread for this Reason, that such who have attended on his In-
‘ss-struCtions, or have been any ways familiar with him, may in time go to «
“ the holy Tribunal, confess their Fault, and implore Mercy, before they
“ are sent for, or apprehended. By this Means they impose on many, who,
“ if they had waited for their Summons, had never been summoned at all² ,

“ Or if it should have happened that they had been summoned, would not
“ have been dealtwith more severely than ‚they generally are who trust to ,
ff, the Inquifitors Promises. ’
