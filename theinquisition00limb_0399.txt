the Kino’s Ministers, who, by prohibiting his Book, had presumed to lay hold

of the ffcclefiastical Authority. After this, Paul V, being created Pope, June
13th ofthe same Year, the Cardinal wrote a long Letter to the King of Spain, in
which amongst other Things‚ he afferts, that it belonged only to the Pope, to
approx’re or disapprove all manner of Books, and especially Ecclesiastical ones ς

and grievouss y complains that his Majesty’s Ministers had prohibited his Book

in Italy, to the great Reproach and Contempt of the Eccleslastical Authority.

The King sent the Cardinal no Answer, but privately approved the Edi& of

his Ministers. In the Year 1607. the Cardinal published his Twelfth Volume

of Annals, and could not contain himself, but in an entire Digreffion rea

the Church‚ and Authorz‘ty of the Catholick Faith, because in these most unhnppy ᾗ· 29·
Times the King's Ministers have dared to do, what is dreacfful to relate, and herri- §- 84,
hle to affl, viz. to censure Writings that have been approved by the Pope, st) that the
Booksellers are not sttffered to fell them, without Leave first obtained from them, which
sometimes they deny at Pkasure, prohibiting the Sale of them, and thereby manifest

to theWorld that they ιιὲἳ contrary to Right and Justice. What else is this, but what

*tis Impiety to say, to wrest one of the Keys given by Christ to Peter, viz. the Key

of Knowledge‚ out of the Hands of his Succeffors, and tosnffer it to be ufhrped by a
Lay Hand, and Lay Princes. The Spanish Senate‚ according to Custom, pro-2»
ceeded ssowly, and with mature Advice, and waited three whole Years. But

in the Year 1610. the King published an Ediet, by which he condemned
and prohibited the said Book, and treated the Cardinal in the same manner 35Δ

he had done him and his Predeceffors. And to give that Decree the greater
Authority, he commanded it to be published in Sicily, by Order of Cardinal
Dorici, who confirmed it by subscribing it with his own Hand ·, and which.
was printed, and every where dispersed about and sold. The Court of Rome
was greatly disturbed at it, and especially because 'twas put in Execution by

the Cardinal’s Command. However the Spaniards would never revoke the
Decree.

Thus we see that the K'ing of Spain vindicated his Authority, and the How
nour of his AncestorS, because the Controversy was about the Right ofEm-
pire. But this is the only Instance of this Nature, and which the King could
not pass over without injuring his own Majesty. In all other Cases the Power of
prohibiting Books is left wholly to the Inquisitors, which, as werhave seen, is
very large in the Kingdom of Spain,
