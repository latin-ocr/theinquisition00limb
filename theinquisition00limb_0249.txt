who contradi& and rebel against them. We also grant them the Power to restraz‘n,
under the same Censure, from the Office of Prmcth, which by κο means belong to
them, the questuary Predz'ccznts, whose Bustneſs it is stmply to ask only charitable Sap-
ports‚ and to sell an Indulgence, if they should hoppen to have one.

In the same Year 1235. 17 Cal. June, Pope Gregory commanded the Bishop
of Huffm, the Prior of Βανεεῖοηίι, and F riar Wzlliam Barbarmm a Predicant‚ that
they should not suffer the Office by any Means to relax, but should make In—
quifition against Hereticks in the Province of Tarracon, and proceed according
to the Canons. He also appointed Friar Robert, a Predicant, inquisitor Gene—
ral against Hereticks in the whole Kingdom of Hence, and commanded him so
to proceed in the Causes committed to him, as that the Innocent should not pe-
·rish, and that Iniquity should not remain unpunished. The Bull of this Coma
miffion is extant, dated at Perouse‚ 10 Cal. of September, and 9th Year of his
Pontificate ·, in which he prescribed the F orm of Penance to such as abjured
their Heresy, and ordained many other Things against Hereticks, and com-
manded the Provincial of the Teutonick Order of Predicants, that he should
chuse fit Persons out of all Germany, to preach in every Place the Wordos the
-Cross against the Hereticks and Sarmens.

Concerning the first Hz'ndrances to the Progrefi of the INQJISIT10N0

Ltho’ the Pope perpetually pressed the Inquifition, yet it was with great
Difficulty admitted. The Novelty of the Tribunal, by which the Laity

were excluded wholly from all Judgment against Hereticks, greatly offended
Men. They were indeed willing to leave to the Ecclefiasticks the Affair of
Doctrine, to judge what was orthodox and what heretical. But they con-
tended that the Judgment of their Persons belonged to them ·‚ viz, to deter-
mine whether any Person profeffed any opinion, condemned by the common
Judgrnent of the Clergy‚ and so became an Heretick 3 and especially they be-
lieved that it belonged to their Tribunal to pronounce Sentence against the
guilty. Whereas they now found themselves wholly excluded from all Share
in it by this new Tribunal‚ which the Pope was endeavouring every where to
erest. All the Power left to the secular Magistrate was only to put to Death
those who were condemned for Hereticks by the Ecclesiasticks‚ whereby he
became a mere Slave to the Inquifitors‚ as being obliged to execute their Sen-
-tence wirh a blind Obedience, without any Cognizance of the Crime. This
was the Case even of some, who otherwise were zealous Defenders of the Pa-
pal Authority. Amongst others, Lewis King of France made a Law, by Raynald.·
which he commanded, that his Subjects‚ when cited before the Ecclefiasticala- 1236.
Tribunals, should not appear to plead theIr Cause ; and that if they were cen· §- 3¹, &e-
