feffing a Crime which had never been committed. Thus ferrerius reports,
that a VVoman confeffed, that in the Night she took a certain Infant srom the
Breasts of its Mother, and carried it into the Ass'embly of the VVitches,
where it was killed by her and her Companions. But upon examining the
Mother of the Insant, she declared that no such Accident had ever happened
to it. Now the Reality of the Offence is proved by the Judgment of skil-
ful Physscians, if they do clearly determine that the Disease is not natural,
but poffibly and probably a Witchcraft, and there be legal Proofs that the
Witchcraft is committed by the woman. After this the Inquifitor may
proceed to Imprisonment‚ first taking Advice of the Counsellors. After
Imprisonment he searches her House with a Notary, to see what Things they
can find in the Coffers and Betis, both for the Aslistance of the Person inqui-
sited, as whether there be Crowns ἦ Divine Services, Books of Devotion and
the like3 and for the Affistance also of the Fisca13 as whether there be
any Images of &Vax run through with Needles, Powders, Ointments,
Papers with Croffeb‚ Boo-ks containing Witchcrafcs, Bones under Ground,
Poysons, Bonos of dead l'ersons, and all extraordinary Things found unJler
the Thressiold‚ and in the Beds. This Search must be made by the Mini-
sters of the holy Office, in the Presence of the Notary before the Inquifitor.
None of the Famiiy of the Person accused of Witchcraft must be present.
And here they advise that all unusual Things found in Beds are not to be
looked on as a Tokcn of XVitchcraft3 sor some such 'l'hings may naturally
happen ·, and therefore such Things can cause but a very light Suspicion, un-
less whatthey find in the said Places are in themselves, and, according to the
common Use of Witches, fit to perform magical Operations. As for Instance,
if halfof an human Skull is found in the Bed or on the Pillow of the Witch,
and another half exaffly answering to the former, is found in her Chest, a
very considerable Suspicion would from hence arise against such Person, as
the prudent Judge shall determine, and certainly greater than if no such
half Skull had been found at all. These and other Thmgs, too tedious to
mention, the Inqu'fitor is commanded to take prudent Notice of‚· least he

glousld proceed against any Person as a Witch, rashly, and without just
au e.
