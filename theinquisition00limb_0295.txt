t'hat that Appeal¹ was made to escape Justice, and would occafion great Scan-
dal and Danger‚ and therefore intimated to the Pope what was neceffary [ο
preserve the Faith, and besought him that he would not suffer any Persons‚
by frivolous Pretences, to bring the ordinary Jurisdiffion of the Holy Offi ce
into Contempt. The Pope was not ignorant that the Causes of the Bishops,
when guilty of Heresy, belonged to the Apostolick See, but however did not
cite thern to Rome, but appointed the Biffiop of {Tonrnay his Nuncio or Com-
miffary 'm Spain, who should examine the Cause jointly with the Inquifitor,
and report the whole Affair upon the Judiciary Process to the Apostolick See,
and waic for the Determination of his Holiness thereupon, but ordered that the
Inquifitor should proceed upon all otherS, who were not Bishops‚ accused of
Heresy, according to his Office. This was granted, says Snrita, at that Time

of the Wise Men, was granted the Space of four Years‚ within which they
were either to be converted to the Catholick F aith, or sell all their Ef-
fests, and depart- from Spain, with all their Goods and Chattels they had pur-
chased with Money. For, as Paramus says, they were not allowed to carry Mo-
ney out of Spain, either Silver or Gold, because it had been prohibited by Law
long before for the publick Good. This Edi& was render'd more severe by
a new Constitution of Thomas Turrecremata, Inquifitor General of the F aith, in Bzovius,
