The His-rom( of the INQtJl-SITION.
ὁ( There is frequent Mention made of canonic-al Purgation‚ in the Papal

“² '· ‘² Lzuv, and tho’ in all other Crimes ’tis grown into Disuse, yet in the Crime

Μ of Heresy 'tis now praftised, and is very common in the sacred Court of

ἐς the Inquisitors. For which Reason Godosredpraises Spain in these Words.
“ Persons suspected of Heresy are punished in the most religious Kingdoms
“ of Spain, triumphing especially in these Times, and worthy of fingular
‘⁴ Praise, because it suffers not only no real Heresy, but even no Suspicion of
“ Heresy. to remain even a ⁴Mon] ent without a suitable Censure.''

¹In the Cause of Canonical Purgation they proceed accordssng to this Manner
and Custorn. The Inquisltors, Bishop, or his Vicar and Affeffors, or the
learned Council meet together, and aster discuffing the Proofs, condemn the
Criminal to purge himself by certain VVitnefi‘es. The Number of these Wit-
ncsses is arbitrary, and not precisely determined. Sometimes two Abbots
were deputed. 'Cap² in Juventute de purgat. Canon. Sometimes there have
‘been fourteen Compurgators. Eod. tit. Cap. Inter sollicitudines. In the same

«ε n. Place thereare twelve named, and in the Chapter Ex tuarum, seven or five

are prescribed. The Judge is to consider the Nature of the Person, Crime

{3 and Infamy, and then to ,order the Number of the Compurgators to be grea-
αἱ ter or less. For as to Persons of greater Power, or of more Note, or who
⁰ -labour under greater Infamy, more are required, than from other mean and
vunknown Persons, who can’t so easily procure a large N umber of Compurga-

tors, to purge themselveS, because all Compurgators must come in volunta-
rily, and can't be compelled as other Witneffes. But ‚yet ordinarily the Num-
beris determined, that every Criminal shall purge himself with about seve-n
Witnesses, with this Addition‚ that if he fails in one, tWO, three or more, he
shall be looked on as fully convifted of the Crime.

4 ⁴ Formerly, he who was defeftive in only one Expurgator, was condemned
‘⁶ as a Convict, because he was not purged by all. But when that was found
‘⁶ to be very dangerous, and, as it might be said, that he was purged by all
‘⁶ who was purged by the greater Part, it was agreed on, that at the same
‘⁶ time when the Number of Purgators were agreed on, it should be deter-
“ mined, that if any one failed either of one, two or three, or more of them,
‘⁴ he should be esteem’d as an Heretick Convict. For both these Things are
‘⁶ entirely at the Pleasure of the Judgeff'

These Witneffes must be of the same Order as'the accused or defamed Per-
son himsels, i. e. if he be a Religious they must be religious; if of the secu-
lar Clergy, they must be of the secular Clergy·, if a Soldier, they must be
Soldiers. But here they take the Word Order in general, but don't extend
it to any particular Divifions under ir. So that if a Bishop is to be purged,
Abbots and religious Presbyters may be admitted with Bishops in the Purga-
tion. And so in the others. But if such Compurgatots are not to be found,
there must be chosen some other good Men, Citizens or others. The Corn-

. purgators must be Catholick Men, of anapproved Life and good Reputation,

who have not only been acquainted with his present, but with his ,former

f'Conversation and Life, and who ‚probably will not conceal the Truth, or ,

say
