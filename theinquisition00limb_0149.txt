that this was his great Comfort‚ that be had not fhzmned to decim-e tlfe Ctunfil

of God. lf then the inspired Apostles were to confine themselves to what τὴνεγ
received from God, and had no Power to make Atticles os Faith, and fix

Terms of Communion and Salvation, other than what they were imme-
diately ordered to do by Christ, it is absolutely impoffible that the Clergy

ean have that Power now‚· who have, as Ι apprehend, no immediate Com-

miffion from Christ, nor any dire& Inspiration from his Holy Spirit. Nor

is there any Thing iu the Circumstanees of the World to render such a power
defirable‚· because the Apostles have shewn us allThings that we need believe

01· praflise as Christians‚and commanded the Preachers of theGospel to teach

no other Dossrines but what they received from them. Hence St· Peter’s Ad-

vice to the Elders‚ that they ssiould jeed tlse Flock ο] God, not as lerding it over 1 Pet. v. 3,
the Heritage. And St. Paul, in his E'pistles to Timothei, instruffing him in the
Nature of the Gospel Doftrines and Duties‚ tells him, that hy putting tke1Tim.i·.‚

These were the Things to which Timothy was to confine himself, and to com-

mit to others, that they might be continually preached in the Christian
Church3 and ofConsequence ’tis the same Apostolick DoC‘ttine that the
Bithops‚ or ElderS, or Ministers of the Chureh, are to instruet their Hearers

in now, as sar as they understand it, without mixing any Tliing of their

own with it, or of any otherPersons whatsoever.

The great End and Defign of the ministerial Office, is· for the pet-fissili& Acis Π,
of the Sanus, and the ediffing ofthe Body of Cluvst. Hence the Elders are com- ἰδ’·
manded to take Heed to themselves, and to the Flock over which the Holy chst‘ had
made them BISHoPs, to seed the Church ofGod. They are likewis‘e exhorted to
bold fast the faithful Word, as they had been taught, that by found Donrme thei· may
be able toexhort and convince others. They are to give Attendame to Restm,

Truths of the GospeI, charging them, before the Lord‚ not to strive esbout
unprofttable Word s, but to be gentle to all Men, and in Affeekness to instruc‘} evei-2
t‘hose who oppose. They are to contend earnestly sor the Faieh, as well as other
Christians, but then ’tis for that Faith which was once delivered ro tlse Saints ,-
