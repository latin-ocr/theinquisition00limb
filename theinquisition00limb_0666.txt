other Ecclefiastical Persons, whom you shall think fit to entrust with the Affair, cau-
fing also the Counts, Barons, Rulers and Consuls of Cities and other Places, to swcar,
that when it shall be required of them, they will faithfully and effectually affist the
Church against Hereticks and their Accomplices, according to their Office and Power,
and* bona fide, endeavour to exterminate with all their Might, out of the Places
subjec‘i¹ to their Jurisdic‘lion, all such Persons as shall be marked for Hereticks by the
Church. And ‘cchoever shall relapss after such Abjuration, and fhall not observe and

Bsut the Instruffion of Valadolid, made An. 1488. c. 12. says thus: Likewisie
they have appointed, that such who are not come to the Age of Discretion, as well
Males as Females, shall nothe obliged to abjure publickly, till after the said Y ears of
Discretion, which is the twelfth Year of Women, and the fourteenth of Men. And
in this Sense is to be understood the Statute cs the Seville Instruc‘t'ions, which regulates
this Matter. And when they shall have exceeded the aforesaid Y ears, let them ab·
jure what they have offended in when they wereof younger Y ears, if they have been
capable of Deceit. From whence it may be coIlected that Boys and Girls might
abjure before this Age, tho' not publickly. Fina11y‚ the Council of Nar·
bonne hath thus decreed, cap. 6. Cause all Persons to confess and abjure their
Faults publickly in an Aſjembly of the Clergy and People‚ and to swear according to
what is more fully contained in the Apostolick Commands, and in the Statutes of our
Lord the Pope of Rome, unless where the Slightneſs of the Fault, and the Enormity
( poffibly it should have been read the Smallness) of the Scandal, should be thought in
Reason to defi’rve an Abatement of this Rigour. And as to every one of them, let
there be drawn up publick Instruments containing the Crimes, Abjurations, Promi-
ses and Penances of the said Persons, lest the Truth, long concealed, but now so won-
derfully and mercifully discovered, should fartherperifh or distzppear.

Ifthe Crimina} knows how to write, he must subscribe his Abjuration; if he
doth not know how to write, or can’t, the Inquifitor and Notary must subscribe
for him. This is prescribed by the Inquifitors of Spain, by the Madrid In-
struction, An. 1561. c, 42. Let the Abjuration which the Criminals make, be put
at the End of the Sentence, and the Pronunciation of it, which the Criminals fhall
subscribe, if they know how to write, putting their Names to it 3 but if they know not
how to write, then one of the Inquisttors and the Notary shall subscribe for them.

When the Abjuration is made, because every Herenck is excommunicated‚
they are absolved from Excommunication upon this Condition, viz. if they
return to the Unity of the Catholick Faith with a true Heart and Faith un-
feigned, and observe the Commands injoined thern3 which is expressly ad-
ded, that if they should not observe them, it may appear that they were not
absolved.

Those who commit heretical and apostate Faus, must be thus reconciled ac-
cording to the Praffice received in the Tribunal of the Inquisltion. If they
voluntarily appear and say, that they did not believe they ought to do s0, but ’
retained the Faith in their Heart, then they abjure as vehemently suspeeted,

and have other salutary Penancesinjoined them. 1f they say that they btgihi
