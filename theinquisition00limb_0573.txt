Messenger, to the Office of the Inquffidon, where, when they come, they
are legally examined. First, they take an Oath upon the Scriptures to speak
the Truth. After this he is asked by the Inquisitor, whether he knows, or
can guess the Cause of his Citation and present Examination? It· he says yes,
he is interrogated how he knew it? If he says 110, he is interrogated, whether
he hath known, or doth now know any one or more Hereticks, or Persons
suspeeted of Heresy, or at least is able to name any such? whether he
knows N? What was the Occafion ofhis Acquaintance with him ? How long
he hath known him? Whether he hath been used to converse with him?
Whether he hath heard at any time any Thing from the said N. concerning
the Catholick Religion ?‘Whether ever he was in such a Place with the said N.
and whether the said N. did or said there such and such heretical Things, or
savouring of Heresy? Who were present when N. did or said the aforesaid
Things? How often he saw them said or done, and on what Occasion, and
how? Whether the said N. spoke the aforesaid Things in Jest, or without
thinking, or thro' a Slip of his Tongue, or as relating the Herefies of some
other Person or Persons? Whether he said any Thing which ought not to
have been said thro' Hatred or Love, or omitted and concealed somewhat that
ought to have been explained? He is farther admonished to tell the single
Truth, because, it he is detected of speaking falsely, he will be made to
suffer the Penalties, not only of Perjury, but of favouring Heresy, and that
therefore he ought to tell the Truth, and beware of L?es. Because, ifit ap-

conceals and hides them, jhe may be confined, and compelled to give Securi-
ty, and to oblige himself not to depart from that City and Place where he is
examined, and under a Penalty, fixed by the Inquiffior, to make his Ap<-
pearance as often as and wheresoever the Inquifitor ssiall command him.
When the Truth cannot be found out from the Mouth of the Wssmess and Canna,
these general InterrogatorieS, the Italian Inquifitors come to particular Inter-Amohlbi‘fi³
rogatories concerning the Place and Person denounced, that sothe Truth
may be discovered, after which the Witness is dismiffed, being first injoined
Secrecy upon Oath, and signing what he bath said. Al] these Things are
taken down by a Notary, and inserted into the Acts of the Process. 8251>sz-
cas gives a short Account of this Matter‚ Tit. 44. ᾗ. 1 1⁰

“ When the Witnesses come to the Inquisltors, to testify against Here-
“ ticks or suspe&ed Persons‚ they are to be exhorted and admonished‚ that
“ they don't dare to give false Witness thro' Hatred, Enmity, or other evil
“ Affection. And besides, it must be declared to them, how heinous a
“ Wickedness all false Witneffes commit, but especially those who desitne
“ innocent Persons with the Crime of Heresy, But ifthey affirm that they
“ are moved only by a Zeal for the Catholick Faith‚ their Testimonies are
.“ to be written down.''

’Tis the Custom in some Inquisitions, that before the Criminal is appre-

hended, the Witnesses named by the Denouncer should, aster two orDtlirce
