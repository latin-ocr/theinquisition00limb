“ licite her Confessor, but to make a full Confestim, accuses her self, by

“ discovering a lustsul Mind towards the Confeffor himself, or towards any
“ other Person, and the Confeffor says, We will talk of this when your Con-
“ feffion is ended, and then immediately solicites her. Secondly, If a Con-
“ seffor persuades a VVoman to consess to him with an Intention of soliciting
‘⁶ her, and immediately aster the Confeffion tempts her to dishonourable
“ Affions. Thirdly, lf immediately after Confeffion he says to the Peni-
“ tent, repeating t'ne Sin confessed by her, since you have carnally lain with
‘⁶ another Persou, do me also the Favour and lay with me. Fourthly, if a
“ Conseffor solicires a ssoy, after he hath consessed and absolved him, by car-
“ rying him immediately, aster Confeffion, into his House or Chamber, to
“ give him a figned Copy os his Conseffion. Fifthly, IfaConfeffor enjoins
‘⁶ Penance to a 'Woman that hath confeffed to him, viz. to be whipped na-
“ ked by the Confefl'or himself, and when the Penance is to be done, he him-
“ sels whips her with his own Hand or with aScourge. Sixthly,1fa Confeffor
‘⁶‘ persuades a VVoman to ssiew her Privy Parts to him, which, in her Confes-
“ sion, she declared to be affeffed with a certain Disease.''

'Tis the same with those, who, tho' they do not solicite in the very A& of
Conseffion, yet do it in the Place appointed to hear Confeffion, according to
the Constitution of the General Inquifition, before Paul V. July 10.
1014.

Women thus solicited are admitted to prove this Offence, viz. if the Wo-
man be of an approved Life, and the confessor be given to the Sins of the
Flesh ·, but not if the WVoman be scandalouS, and a Whore ·, and if they do
not appear voluntarily before the Inquifitors, but are forced by their Confes-
sors, upon their Refusal to absolve them, unless they discover the evil Con-
feffor. Hence it comes to pass, that the Depofition of several Women is not
sufficient for the Conviffion os a Confessor. Thus Carencz reports, that by
Order os the sacred Congregation of the supream Ronlanjnquifition, a Parish
Priest at chples was not accounted as convicte& though several Women de-

Congroegation, and, ycvrffeffing nothing, suspended for a Year from his Cure.

However, the Depofition ofa Wonran only is not sufficient Proof for the
Apprchension or Torture of the Confeffor‚ unless he himself hath a bad Cha-
taeter, because they never proceed to torture, unless the Crime be half pro-
ved. So that as they teach, s1nce two Women are not enough to make a full
Proof, one cannot be sufficient for the half Proof,

But if the Crime be half proved, the Confeffor may be tortured, to make
him consess the Αξὶ. If he confeffes it, or is fully conviered of it, and denies
an heretica] Intention‚ he is to be tortured as to his Intention‚ viz. to disco-
ver whether he believed, that it was lawful to abuse the Sacrament of Pe-
nance ro lascivious Affions, and to use the Sacrament as a Mean-5 to obtain
such Purposes.
