leave nothing for the Children of Hereticks, tho’ they prove Catholicks, no
not so much as seems due to them by the Law ofNature. ·
The next Puniihment that follows this Confiscation ofGoods, is the difinhe-
riting the Children‚ insoniuch that tho' they are Catholicks, they can never
inhesit the Estates of their Fathers who died in Heresy. Cap. Vergentis in seni‘-
um de haeret, Neither ought any Pretence of Compaffion to prevent this severe Cen.
fitre of distnheriting even their orthodox Children, fince in many Cases the Judgment of
God lh proceeds, as thot the Children cire temporczlly pnnifhed for their Fathers‚ and
becrzitse, according to the Cononicc-zl Sanffims, Crimes are revenged not only upon the
Auth‘ors of them, hut upon their Posterity. Zonchinns adds, that the Children of
[fiereticks are incapable of succeeding to any of their Kin, or toother Per-
sian, whither they die with a Will or intestato. John Royas adds, that* the Chil-
dren of Herfflcks, tho' born before the Commiffion of the Cffirne, are cotn-
prehended under the canonical Penalties and Prohibitions, and says·this is the
common Opinon of the Docffirs. The Reason is, because Heresy is &spiritual
Critne, and doth not derive its Original from the Flesh ·, and therefore it figni-
fies noihing whether the Children be of the infected Root or not. But if a Son
accuses his heretica] Father‚ as his Reward‚ he is freed from the Penalties or·
darined'against the Children of Hereticks‚ according to the Law of the Emperor
Es‘cclerick. W e don’t exclude from the Bozmds of our Mercy such who, far from follow·-
ing she Heresy of their Fathers, shall discover their Wickedness ; fh that to whatever
Panishment the Fothers Guilt is fitbjeJL let their innocent Children be freed from it.
The third Punissumenr is, their being rendred infamous. Cap. Excommuni-
camus. 1 ξ, Credentes. de haeset. There, amongst other Things‚ 'tis said, Le!
him be ipso jure, infomous ·‚ let him not be admitted to any puhlick Offices, cr Coun-
selo, nor to chnse any into them, or to hear W itneſs ; let him also he Intestahle ἦ so that
he can have no Power to make anl‚ or to inherit by Virtue of one. Farthmnore,
let no one be forced to answer him upon any Affair‚ bnt let him he forced ⁴to answer
others. If heshonld hoppen to he chnclge, let his Sentence be void, and 'no Couse b'e
referred to his Hearing. If he be an Aci-vocate, let him not be admitted to plead. If
a Notcny, let no Instrumenn, drawn hy him, be valid‚ but condemned with their con·
detained Aiithor. And in all like Coses we command the some to he ohfi’rved0'.
· The fourth Punissiment is, that they are deprived of all Dominion, natu-

· rai, civil, and that which is introduced by the Law of Nations. First, they
‘ are deprived of that natural Power they have ove1⁴> their Children. Cap, Qi-
,’ cunq3 ὃ. ult. de haeret. 1.,6. Being thus deprivedofthenatural Power of Parents,

they lose all Authority over their Children,wh0, becoming as it were Sti-angers
and Foreigners frorn their Fathers Family‚ are under no Obligation to obey
them as before. This CrimeofHeresy in the Father‚ even before ’tis decla-
red by the Church, frees the Son from his Father’s Power, according to the,
Gloss in Cap. Qiicunq5 §. ult. verbo desierint, de haeret. l. 6.

Farther, they are deprived of that civil Power which they have over their

wiw8sp·3·Servants, and of that political Power, which they have over any others sub-
