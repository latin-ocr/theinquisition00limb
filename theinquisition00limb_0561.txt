 

The Hm-onr ofthe INQUISITION. ¹3¹

If the Criminal be not defamed of the Crimes laid in the Articles of the
inquisition, and he makes this Exception, the Promoter F iscal and the De-
nouncer must necessarily prove the Defamation.

Ifthis cannot be done, the Criminal is absolved from all farther ConcernBrun. de
in Judgment. He may also prove himself to be a Person of good Reportssaeret·1·4
For Instance, if he is accused of being defamed for defending the Doctrineffis· §⁵¹¹⁴
osan Heretick, by some VVriting that he published, he may prove that
he confuted such Dotftrine by writing against it ·, or if he be accused of har-
bouring an Heretick, in some House belonging to him, he may prove that
he hath no Home in that Place, nor ever had since such Person hath been
taken for an Heretick. He may likewise object, that such evil Report was
raised of him by loose and infamous Persons, Enemies, Conspirators, and the like.

But if the Inquifitor proceeds and inquifits not at the Promotion, Denuncia- ς, 12.
tion or Instance of another, but ex mero officio, the Criminal is not to be heard
when he excepts, that he is not defamed of the Crime objected to him ·, nor is
tlie Judge obliged to regard such Infamy3 for there is no Person who can oblige
him to do it, unless the Criminal appeals, In this Case the Judge must inform
his Superior of the Infamy of the Appellant. If also any one departs from
the common Conversation of the Faithful in divine Worship, he is not to be
heard, if he alledges that he is not defamed. For Inquisition may be made

Brunus. Peter, Bishop of Elvas, gives it in a somewhat different Manner, in his420·
first Consultation. “ Let this Manner be observed as to a private Inquisi-

“ tion. First, let the Parson of the Place or Country be sent for, and car-
“ ried to a secret Place, and be required upon Oath to declare the Truth.
“ When this is done, he must be asked if there is a Report that any Per-
“ son is an Heretick‚ or suspeeted of the Faith in his Distriek, or a Fa-
“ vourer or Receiver of them; and if he says there is, he must be asked‚
“ Whether the Report be general ? 1f he can form any probable Coniectures
“ from him, the Inquifitor commands him to name some good and reputable
“ Perfons‚ Men and Women, and makes also Inquiry of them upon Oath. If
‘⁶ they agree, and it appears that they proceed not thro' Hatred‚ Envy or
“ Revenge, he enjoins them Secrecy, and tells them he will keep the Mat·
“ ter secret himself, and that they need not sear. After this the defamed
“ Heretick must be called to a private Place, in the Presence of some
“ few Friars, and a Notary of a good Charaeter, and be told ⁴, You are ac·
“ cused and named to rne as an Heretick, or a Favourer or Receiver. But
“ Iam willing to proceed with you in a way of Peace and Secrecy, and
“ therefore desire you will abiure every wicked Heresy, and give sufficient
“ Security that you will not return to them. The inquisitor must be care·
“ ful not to discover the Accusers to the Persons accused. He must also say,
“ 1f you will swear, and do what Idefire you, I am ready to grant you my
“ Letters Testimonial, that you are of the Number ofthe Faithful. Butif

‘f you will not do it, Ι will declareS bzefore the People that you are anuleltcizcrlz
