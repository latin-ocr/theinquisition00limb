The Jews, as we have before observed from Bzovius, were admitted by

John II. ›King of Portugal‚'under certain Condstions, into his Dominion. ⁶⁶ Ema-
⁶⁶ nuelsucceeded KingJohn II. who in the Year ofour Lord 1497. commanded
⁶⁶ by a publick Edi& all the Jews to depart out of the Kingdoms of Portugal,
⁶⁶ under the Penalty of forfeiting their Liberty‚ as his Predeceffor had before
⁶⁶ him3 and although they incurred the Penalty, yet such was the King’s
⁶⁶ Clemency‚ that it was not inflisted. Many of them indeed departed ·, but
⁶⁶ others, either dreading the bad Treatment they apprehended they should ro-
⁶⁶ ceive from the Officers, Mariners, and others, who were to transport thern in
⁶⁶ their Ships, or else hoping to receive great Advantage from the F ruitful-
⁶⁶ ness of the Country where they dwelt‚ defired to become Christians‚ but
⁶⁶ upon this Condition3 That they should not be liable to any Inquifition
⁶⁶ concerning the Faith, till after twenty Years: And upon this Condition
⁶⁶ they were baptized. But as these Jews did not profess the Catholick F aith
⁶⁶ truly and heartily‚ but seignedly and externally‚ they remained as much
⁶⁶ Jews as they were before ; and so much the more dangerous‚ because con·
⁶⁶ cealed. Thus they brought up their Children in their old Errors of Ju-

‘⁶ King Emanuel was succeeded by John ΙΙΙ. An. 1521. who observing that

“ as proceded from them, but those who ¹were: ancient Christians, were in-
⁶⁶ fected with the Poison of their DoEtrine, contemned the Sacraments of the
‘⁶ Church, did not receive them in the Article of Death, treated with great
⁶⁶ Irreverence holy Images, and especially some ofthe Virgin Mother of God,
⁶⁶ the Lady of Angels (they are the Words of Soustz) confidering these Things
⁶⁶ in his Mind, he desired of -Pope Clement V ΙΙ. the holy Tribunal of the In-
⁶⁶ quifition in his Kingdom. And although this Pope‚ for a long while, and
‘⁶ ostentimes refused it, through the vigorous Endeavourspf the Jews, who
⁶⁶ to their utmost opposed the-royal Petition (for the Jews always hated this
⁶⁶ holy Tribunal, as others do to this Day, for what Reason they best know)
⁶⁶ yet at length, with Difficulty he granted it in F orm of Law, Jan. Cal. 16,

‘⁶ 1531.

⁶⁶ Immediately after this Grant‚ An. 1533. they obtained from the same

‘⁶ Clement VII. a general Forgiveness of all Crimes committed against the
⁶⁶ Catholick F aith, which however had not then its Effeet. But when Cle—
⁶⁶ ment was dead, they obtained in the Year 1534. from PaulIII. his Succes-
⁶⁶ sor, by their importunate Prayers, continu'd Negotiations‚ and the Help
⁶⁶ of those, who by their strenuous Solicitations with the upright Pontiff,
⁶⁶ were best able to affist and defend them3 that the In uisltors of Portugal
