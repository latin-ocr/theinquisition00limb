any Means to any other Office ancl Serviee, that may hinder them in the Exercifh of
this.

But as the Cities thought themselves aggrieved by this Charge, and openly
refused to bear it, the confiscated Effeets of Hereticks have been applied to
these Uses, and the Cross-bearers have bound themselves by V ow, that they
will expend their own Estates for the Defence of the Faith. But that it may·
be more distinffly understood how these Effeets are applied to the Uses of the
Inquifition‚ Ι shall endeavour to trace this whole Affair from the Beginning.

When the delegated Inquifition was first constituted, the Sentence concern- „ly-35⁶
ing the Confiscation of Effectts in the Dominions of the Church, was pro-p. 3·
'nounced by the Ecclefiastical Judge3 but in other Countries by secular Prin-com· 1480
ces, as appears plain from the Text in cap. Vergentis. de haeret. Bac in the
Countriessubjeffl‘ to oar temporal Jurisa'iclion, we orclaz'n that the Goods of Hereticks
shall be exposed to Sale3 and in other Countries we command that it shall be done by
the fi’cular Powers and Princes, ancl zf they appear negligent, we will and command
that they shall he compellecl to do it hy Ecclcfiastical Censure, without Benefit of Ap-
peal. But in a Course of Years it was, without any Difference‚ provided that
the Declaratory Sentence concerning such Confiscation, should every where be
paffed by the Ecclefiastical Judge, who judges of the Crime3 and farther‚
that the Execution of such Confiscati0n‚ viz. the Seizure of the Goods‚ should
be made by the Ecclefiastical Judge, viz. by the Bilhop or Inquifitor ε T he Ex· Cap. ue

ecution ofsuch Confiftation‚ or the Seizure of the Effecls themselves shall not he made Inquisttiff
by Princes‚ or other temporal Lora's, before the Sentencefor such Crime shall have ΜΠ· ,
been publzfhed hythe Bishop of the Place, or some other Ecclefiastz'cal Petjfim, who g Pr⁰7³²7
hath Power in this Affaz'r. C. Cum secundnm leges. §. fin. de haeret÷ lib. 6. ibid. emus.

Whether Hereticks repent οι· not, whether they are converted before they
are delivered to the secular Court‚ or afterwards, their Effeels are ipso saffo,
confiscated. The Goods of Hereticks, who offend more grievoussy, horriblv, and dch. Com
testably than others, we, with the Advice of our Brethren‚ decree to be, 'ipso juffisbcundum
confiscated. Neither doth it fignify whether the Heretick harh perfisted in hisss'5151·tdl⁶6.
Heresy for a longer or fhotter Time3 because Heresy is notjudged of by '²¹⁰' “ ’
the Length of Time.

But if any voluntarily return to the Church, before they are accused 01·
denounced, or if immediately after they are apprehended‚ they make a full

and entire Confeffion of themselves Kar? otherS, whom they know to begge- ·
