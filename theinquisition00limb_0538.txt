’ have determined therefore faithfully to give my Reader whatsoever the Po-

pish Doctorsssand the Inquifitors themselves have with great Labour gathered
together from the Laws, Papal Bolis, and their instructions, concerning the
Method of Proceecing, and to illustrate the Whole by such Examples as
offer themselves to me. And that Ι may omit nothing, I will trace this
Matter from the very Beginning, viz. from the very first Moment in which
the Inquisitor begins his Office‚ down to the Acts of Faith‚ in which the
Sentences are pronounced upon all the Prisoners, and actually put in Ex-
centron.

NVhen the Inquisitor is first constituted by the Pope, he must present

ar himstlf to the King‚ or temporal Lord of those TerritorieS, in which the
· Inqnisitor is deputed by the Apostolick See, and exhibit his Apostolick

2. Commiffion. Then he must demand his Protection for himself, his Colleague,

Notary, servants and their meas, and his orders to his officials ω’
obey the Inquifitor in apprehending Hereticks, their Believers, Receivers,
Defendcm Favonrers, and such as are defamed for Heresy‚ and that they dos>
all :ind singular Matters that belong to their Office in making Execution⁷
against the aforesaid, to extirpate heretical Pravity‚ and to extol the Catho-
lick Fairh, whensoever, and as often as they are required by the Insquifitor,
or in his Name.

When he hath obtained these Letters‚ he must likewise exhibit his Aposto-
lici< Commiffion to the Arch-Bishop and Metropolitan of the Province to»
which he is deputed 3 as also to all the Bishops and their Vicars, to whose-
Dioceffes he is sent. After this he must stiew the Letters which he hath ob-
tained from the King or tem-poral Lord of the Place, to his officials, and
require of them, according to the Law of the Emperor Frederick, that at the-
Desire of the Inquifitor‚ or other Catholick Men, they will apprehend He-
reticks, and when taken, strictly keep them, till being condemned by the
Ecclesiastica] Censure, they perish with an accursed Death. Finally, he takes
an Oath from 'these Officials for their defending the Church against heretical
Pravity, and that they will obey the Inquifitor with all their Might‚ fot-2
whichsEnd he summons them before him by Letters. If they appear, he

that Purpose, upon their bended Knees, and their Hands upon the Book.
of the Gospels. If the Officials desire Time to confider, and refuse afterx
the Expiration of it to take the Oath, the Inquifitor, a few Days after„
must cite them before him, and demand of them to take the Oath, under the
Penalty of Excommunication. If they appear. within the fixed Terin, and
consent to swear, the same Form of the Oath is shewn them. If they do
not appear, after the said Time is elapsed, they are declared excommuni-
cate, and the Excommunication is ordered to be published in the Cathedral
Church. After the denouncing the Excommunication‚ they are absolved
from the Sentence of it if they will take the Oath, and enjoined som} hard
