complains, that whereas formerly the Pope sent his Inquifitors to the Princes-
with Apostolick Briefs, requiring them to prote& and defend them by their
Favonr, as is even yet done in the Confirmation ofa new Bishop ·‚ yet that

now the Council of the Inquifition at Rome gave their Inquifitors such Orders‚

as tho' they sent them into their own Dominions and Territories, and will not.
suffer any ContradiCtion to their Commands.

At length Sixlus V. Aa. 1588. by a Constitution beginning, Immensa AE-

terni Dei, &a appointed 15 Congregations of the Cardinals of the holy Ro-

man Church‚ and affigned to each of them their proper Busmess. He ap·
proves the first Congregation held in the City for Inquisition of heretical
Pravity‚ and confirms their Authority over all Prelates and Inquifitors‚ in
Matters ofI-Ieresy, whether manifest or suspeeh and the Privileges of their Mi-
nisters, and exhorts the Princes to support it, but so, that no Innovation should

be introduced into the Office of the Inquisnim, ere&ed in the Kingdom of
Spain, without consulting the Pope.
