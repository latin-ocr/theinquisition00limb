The INTRODUCTION.

let me add fanher, that this Praetice of impofing Subscriptlons, hath
been the Occafion of innumerable Mischiess in the Chureh of God. ’Twas
the common Cry of the Orthodox and Arians, and all other Hereticks‚ in
their Turns of Power, Either subscribe or depart from your Churches. This
enflamed the Clergy against each other, and filled them with Harred, Ma-
lice and Revenge. Por as by iinpofing these Subscriptions, Inquifition was-
made into the Consciences of others; the Refusal te submit to them was' a
certain Max-k of Heresy and Reprobation; and tne Consequence of this was
the Inflifflm] of all spiritual and temp-oral Punishments- 'Twas impossible
but that such Prot-edures should perpetuate the Schisms and Divifions of the
clun-ch, since the Wrath of Man cannot work the nghteousness of God,
and {Ince Civil Punishments have no Tendency to convince the Conscience,
but only to enflame the Paffions against the Advisers and Inflie‘ters of them..
And as ecclefiastical History gives us so dreadful an Account of the melan·-
c‘lioly and tragical Effe&s of this Pratfftice, one would think that no Nation,
who knew the &Vorth of Liberty, no Christan Prmestant Church, that hat'n
any Regard for the Peace of the Flock of Christ, should ever be found to
nuthotize and continue it-

VI. What Security then ffiall we have left us for Truth and Orthodoxy,'
when our Subserlptions are gone? Why, the sacred Scriptores, those Oracles
of the great God, and Freedom and Liberty to interpret and understand
them as we can3 the Consequence of this would be great Integrity and Peace
of Consciencc‚ in the Enjoyment of our religious Principles, Union and
friendship amongst Christianus, notwithstanding all their Differences in Judg-
me nt, and great Respe& and Honour to those faithful Pastors, that carefully
seed the Fioek of God, and lead them into Pastures of Righteousness and
Pence. We {hail lose only the Incumbi‘ances of Religion, 0111· Bones ofCon-
tention, the Shackles of our Conseiences, and the Snares to Honesty and Vir-
tue 3 whilst all that is {ubstantially good and valuable, all that is truly divine
and heavenly, would remain to ern-ich and bless us· The Clergy would indeed
lose their Power to do Mischief3 but would they not be happy in that Loss,
especially as they would be infinitely more likely to do good? They would be
no longer loolted on as Fathers and Distators in the Faith ς but still they
might remain Ambassadors for Christ, beseeching Men, in Christ’s stead, to
become reconciled to God. And was all human Authority, in Matters of Faith,
thus wholly laid afide‚ would not the &Vord of God have a freer Course‚
and be much more abundantly glorified? All Christians would look upon
Scripture as the only Rule of their Faith and Praffloe, and therefore search
it with greater Diligence and Care, and be much more likely to understand
the Mind cf God therein. The main Things of Christianity, would unque-
flionably be generally agreed to by all ; and as to other Things‚ Points of,

'Speculatiom and difficult Qiestions‚ if Christians differ'd about them, their

Differences would be of no great Importance, and might be maintained,
confistent with Charity and Peace.
