in the Year following, 1436. Uladissaus Jagell0‚ King of Polam, confirmed·
and enlarged, by a Royal Edict, granting them the most ample Power‚ and
commanding all the Magistrates to give them all Manner of Assistance in
the Execution of their Office.

At this Time the Inquifition began to decline in France ·‚ but as therewas Raynald.
a pretty large Number of the Valdenfhs‘remaining in Daupheny, and their Re- ‘²- 1375·
ligion began to spread wider, Gregory applied himself to Charles King os5‘ ²6²²⁷‘'
France. He put him in Mind of the Examples of his Predeceffors in de-
stroying Hereticks‚ and admonished him to suppress the Nobles of Daupheny,
who took the Hereticks under their Proteffion ·, and that he should support
the Authority of the Inquiskors, not only by severer Edico, but by sending
some Royal Officer to their Affistance. King Clam-les yielded to [116 Pope’s
Defires 3 and after the Manner ofhis Anoestors, by a Royal Edicit, command-
ed that Hereticks should suffer the severest Punishments ·, and that the Mau
gistrates in Daupheny should affist and aid the Officers of the Holy Inquifition.¹
⁴ Antonius Maffimus, Apostolick Inter-nuncio, acled in this Affair with such
Zeal‚ that the Prisons vvere scarce sufficient to hold the Criminals·‚ nor was
their Provifion enough for their Support. Gregory having been consulted in
this Manet, order’d‚ That as the great Number of Hereticks was owing to
the Negligence of the Prelates‚ the Revenues of the Churches should be ap-
plied to that Use 3 and commanded new and stronger Jails to be built at Ades,
Ambrune, menne, and Avign0n‚ and granted Indulgences to the Faithful who
should contribute to the Work.

From anoe, those who were called *Turelupini‚ went into Savoy: And
therefore the Pope commanded Amedoeus, Count of Savoy, to condemn them
to the Flames, and asfist the Inquisitors. Bzovius adds, It came to pass, thatsszovius‚
this savage and bruta} Sed} was condemn'd, burs-2⁹52, and wholly extirpated this Tem. a. 1372·
And again ε Many osthefh Hereticks were hurn'd in France at the Pope’s Command. §- 7·
But this horrid Cruelty could not last long, and proved at last fatal to the Raynald.
Judges themselves. For in Savoy the Inquifitors were killed, by those un· {23⁷5
questionably who were afraid that the like Cruelty would be praftised towards ’
themselves·, which when the Pope heard of, he endeavour'd to render the
Murderers hateful to Count Amedoeus, putting him in Mind, that he had
given a most excellent Example of defending the Faith by his Victories over
the Yurks, and recovering Callipoli from them3 and that therefore he hoped
he would not suffer the Blood of those Orthodox Prelates‚ who were ssain out
of a real Hatred to Piety, to be shed with Impunity.

* Some of the Followers of the Valdenste53 so called, according to Popish ἎῙι-ἰὲπε, because
they inhabited only those Places which were exposed to wolves, Du Fresne in Voce.
