Os Soliciting CONFESSORS.

’ξ”ἰ- Y these are understood such Confessors, who, in the SacramentalConfeffiom ⁷
. 5}]} solsscite and provol<e‚ or attempt to solicite and provoke Women to dis-

lionourable Acstions. Paullv. Aa. 1561. Ap. 16. published a Bull against
such Persons, directed to the Arch-Bishop ome-wile, beginning, Cum ficut su—
per, and Pius IV. another, Ap. 6. 1564. and the supream Inquifitors General
an Edist, approved by Clement. Vm. But those Bulls, and that Decree seem
only to take place in Spain, because the Bulls were directed to the. Arch-
Bishop of Seville, and the Decree of the sacred Congregation expressly re-
strained to the Places of Spain. But in the Year 1612. in the Month of A-
pril, it was deereed by Paul V. that all the Inquifitors should be admonished
to command the Conseffors, to abstain from all and every sort of Solicitation,
and to proceed rigoroussy against all those who did not. And finally, there
is extant a Constitution of Gregory XV. published Aug. 30, 1622, beginning,
Univeifi dominici, in which he confirms the Letters or Bull of Paul IV. ‘and
commands it to be firmly and inviolably observed, not only in the Kingdoms
os Spain, but in all other Parts of the Christian World. And because the
Words os that Bull about the Middle of it, Whatfhever Peisons, mid whosoever
theyfhall be which they solicite, are general, from this Generality of the words
they conclude that they extend also to Confeffors, who solicite Boys in the
Sacramenta] Confeffion.

The Incontinence of the Priests gave Occafion to these Edieoe and Bulls,
viz. because, as the Words are in the Bull of PazslIV. Certain Priests in the
Kingdomof Spain, andinthe Cities and Diocefts thereos, having Cure of Souls, or
exercifiiigsuch Cmefor others, or otherwise deputed to hear the Coififfoiis of Peni-
ienis, hove broken out into so heinous aiz Iniquity, asto abiise the Sacrmnent ofPe-
nance in the-very Λῖἶ of hearing Cmfhffions, and thus are not afraid to injure this
Sacramenl itsffl, and him who laath appointed it, the Lord God mid our Saviour
Jestis Christ, by enticiiig andprovoking, or trying and procm'ing to elitice and pro-
voke pendent [Vomen to lewd Afflions, whilst they are hearing their Confaeffion.

When this Eull was first brought into Spain, all Persons were commanded ⁴

by a publici< Edicit, solemnly published throughout all the Churches of the
Arch-Bilhoprick of See-ille, that whosoever knew or had heard of any Monks
or Clergymen who had abused the Sacrament of Confeffion to these Crimes,
or had in any manner atsted in this vile Manner at Confeffion with their Daugh-
ter or Daughters, they should discover him within thirty Days to the holy
Tribunal ·, and very grievous Censures were annexed to such as should neglect
or conternn it. When the Decree was published, so large a Number of Wo-
men went to the Pal-ace of the Inquifitors in the City os saville only, to make
their Discoveries os these most wicked Conseffors, that twenty SecretarieS,
