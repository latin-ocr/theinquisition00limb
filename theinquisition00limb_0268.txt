‘⁶ the Church. of Rome, who don't renounce the Things that they possess, nor
‘⁶ give the Goods of the Church to their Parents, Kinssolk, and FriendS. This
‘⁶ Church he says is that carnal Church of which John speaks in the Revelations,
‘⁶,- which he calls Babylo-72 the great Whore. Item, It is that Beast of which
“ John there speaks, which hath seven Heads and ten Horns, because she hath
“ seven mortal Sitis, and keeps not the ten CommandmentS. Item, It is that
“ &Voman of which John there speaks, which had the Golden Cup in her Hand,
ιι soll Of [he Abomination omes. Item, He expounds the double State of
‘⁶ the Church, where, amongst other Things, he says, that there can be no
“ Sanc‘tiry where there is not true Poverty. So that from the Time that the
“ State of Poverty ofChrist and his Apostles was changed under Pope silvester,

‘⁶ Sanctity was taken away.

“ Asci·xva1*ds the aforesaid Peter being judicially required that he would

“ swear to speak the Truth, showed himself very backward to swear, saying
‘⁶ that he was afraid sor his Constience, and sayingto the Inquifitor, that he
“ should see and beware of sinning by making him swear, because God had
“ forbidden Swearing in the Gospel. Item, After some Days the aforesaid Peter
‘⁶ being judicially required that he should take an Oath to speak the Truth,
“ would not, and wholly refused to swear, saying that he repented that he had
“ sworn before the Inquisitor, and believed that he finned by swearing‚ saying
‘⁶ that his Consciencc was confirmed that he ought not to swear, and in this
‘⁶ Obstinacy he continued for a Month and more, saying that St. James in his‘
⁶‘ canonica} Epistle, and Christ in the Gospel, had forbidden us to swear, and
“ he read ilie Words of St. James in his canonical Epistle, and the Words of
‘⁶ the Gospel. And when it was said and expounded tov him that the Apostle
“ Paul swore, and the Angel, and that the Catholick Chu‘rch had determined
“ that it was lawful to swear for Affirmat-ion of 'the Truth, and that it was
“ the Decree of the Church, that whosoever‚ thro' a damnable Superstition,
‘⁶ should refuse an Oath, and will not swear, shall for this alone be adjudged
“ Hereticks, and suffer thejust Punishment of such, notwithstanding the afore-
“ said, he the said Peter absolutely refused to swear, saying that the making
“ such a Statute or Order seemed to him erroneous. Being interrogated, if
“ he believed that the Pope, the Vicar of Christ, could make any Statute or
‘⁶ Order, by which he and other Christians shouldbe obliged, fince the Pope
“ hath the Power of Binding andLoofing on Earth‚ he answered that ᾖε
‘⁶ heard a certain learned Pastorsay, that-some misunderstood these Words of

⁶‘ the Gospel, thatsoever γε fhall bimi on Eam, δῖε. because they were 'so to
‘⁶ be understood, that as the Pontiff or Priest in the Old* Testament-'Wa's to

‘⁶ judge between Leprosy and Leprosy, so the Pope and Bishops have' no
“ other Power but to discern between Sin >··an'd Sin, ι’. e. between those* who
‘⁶ are to be bound, and those who are to be loosed, because otherwise
‘⁶ they take upon them the Pride of the Pharisees, because they mortify Soul‘s
‘⁶ they ought not to mortify, and enliven Souls they ought not to enliven.

“ Some D.1ys after this he oftentimes obstinately refused to swear, tho’ at

“ length,with greatDifficulty, he consented to swear the 7th of the Calends of

‘⁶ November,
