The H'r STORY of· the snoursmro Ν.
“ Di05, por vida de Dios, voto a Dios, malgrczdo aya Dios, 0 despecho de Dios,
“ and the like, i. e. let it trouble God, by the Life of Gon, I vow to God, God’s
‘⁶ Curse on you, or Godspite you, are not heretical‚ because not opposed to a

“ Confeffion of the Faith, although they are absolutely Blasphemies. Ther
“ Punishment of these belongs to the ordinary Judges.'' In Italy also 'tis

' ⁷· ‘¹ not reckoned Blasphemy : if any one says, Al corpo di Dio, ο dira vel pu-

“ tana dz' Dio becco ·‚ vel al dispelle dz' Christophero, or putana della virgine Cio-
“ ταινίας i. e. Body ofG0d‚ or he willfizy, ὅτε. or in spite of Sl. Christopher 3
or the W'hnre of the Virgin Joan. v

'Tis disputed amongst the Doctors whether this be Blasphemy, Al dispetto,
che non vo dir cli cilo, or, putam, cheno vo dir (Zella V. ῘἉ. In spite, not meaning
G0d3 or Where, not meaning the Virgin Mary3 which some deny, and
others affirm, But these are accounted heretical Blasphemies: Diopczrtefasw,
δῦ) putanti della Virgine, i. e. ‘Ibe IVhore of the Virgin, altho' the Word
Mary is not pronounced·, as is also this·‚ Dio becco diavolm if pronounced
by any one who is accustomed to utter heinous Blasphemies against God.
According to Royczs, ‘⁶ Heretical Blasphemy, though spoken conditional:-
“ ly, is to be punilhed by the Inquifitors of the Faith·, as for Instance,
“ I do not believe in God unless I will strike you. Because this conditional
“ Blasphemy contains in it a pure affirmative Impliciteness, viz. that if hev
‘⁶ could not kill him without not believing in God, he was prepared wil-
“ lingly to do so. They also proceed very severely against an execrable
‘⁶ Curioni that hath crept into the Kingdoms of Arragon and Valencia, viz.
‘⁵‘ of swearing by the Members of God, which is greatly blasphemous; and
‘⁶ by the Members of Christ, which is great lrreverence, and from both
“ these there arises great Suspicion os Heresy.'' To these may be added
that execrable Species of Blasphemy‚ related by Arnold Albertz'nus, in his ,
Book de Agnos. Affert. haeret. Q. 6. ᾗ. 21.

These Blasphen‘ries, according to the Qality of the VVords and Persons,
and the Circumstances of Times and Places, are esteemed more or less wicked
and horrible. Pegncz “ thinks those are to be reckoned amongst the greatest,
“‘ which are uttered against the most holy Many, Virgin Mother of God.
“ And altho' Blasphemers regularly think differently in their Mind from

“ what they say, yet they belong to the J-udgment os the Inquifitors, be-v
U cause by blaspheming they are thought to put on the Person of one who<

⁸ thinks agreeable to what he himself had spoken·, and since by the exter-

“ nal A& they give some Token of Infidelity, therefore certain Blasphe.
“ mies are subjetft to the Jurisdic‘tion of the Judges of the Faith, that they
‘·‘ may understand, whether Blasphemers do really think as they speak.''

Heretical Blasphemers are punished in this Manner by the Inquifitors. If
the Blasphemy be very heinous‚ and the Blaspherner a mean Person, he is
mad-e to wear an infamous Mitte, hath his Tongue tied, and pinched with an
Iron or Wooden Gag, is carried forth as a publick Spectacle without his
Cloak, whipt with Scourges, and banished. But if he be a Person of better

condition, or Noble, he is brought forth without the Mitre, thrust {or a
⁴lffle
