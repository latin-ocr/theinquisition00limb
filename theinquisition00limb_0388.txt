The H1sToRY ofthe INQU151T10N‚

Pravity‚ committed to your Care, may happily prosper in your Hands, to the Glory
of God, and Increase of the Catholici< Ruth, we by Authority of thesi}² present, grani
to you, and every one of you, the Power of compelling by the Ecclefiastical Censure,
either hy your selves, or by others, whom you or any one of you shall jua'ge proper for
this Busineſs, all thoſs? coho have, or have had any Writings or Instruments of the
Inquzfition, or belonging to this Office, made hitherto by any, or to be made, against
Hereticks, their Believers, Receivers, Favourers or Defenders‚ to deliver them to
you, or some oneof you, without any Difficulty or Danger of Delay‚ without allow-
ing them any Benefitof Appeal.

From this Rescript they infer, that the CrhninaL in a Cause of Heresy, is
obliged to deliver the proper Instruments against himself to the Fiscal, from
which he may gather his Intention, and form his Accusation3 although re-
gularly the contrary is determined by Law3 and not only against himself,¹
but against every other Person the Fiscal proceeds against 3 which though it
doth not take place in other Cases, yet doth in Favour of the Faith. So
that if Titius is apprehended for Heresy, and delivers an heretical Book, or
the like, to Sempronius, Sempronius is to be compelled to produce it not only a-
gainst himself, but against Titius too. And what in this Case is said of Books
and Writings, extends toall other Things which may help to find out the
Truth, which are to be all given in, in Favour of the Faith.

Excomrnunication also is a Branch of the Inquifitorial Power, which they

ooo vo— have a very ample Power ofinfliffing, because their ExcommunicatIOn is more

heavy than that of others, and that in a sourfold RespeCk. First,. because

Ι. whoever- are excommunicated by them, must be put under the Ban by a

publick Edi& and Proclamation. Secondly, their Effeeks must be confisca—
ted, and the Inquifitors may compel the Magistrates and Governors to both.⁴
This appears from a certain Privilege of Innocent IV. beginning, Cum Fra·
tres Praedicatores ·‚ in which he writes to the Barons, and other Lords‚ and Go-
vernois, and CitieS, saying, We have thought it meet to hcstech, exhort and ad-
ayorgissglffl 2322 fi'zfistfissfitz‘itztztth bZn‘ZJussefflfffftffkii‘ingte {ZZff'memd

for defendier& receiving, or favouring Hereticks, be put under the publick Bau,- ,and

have all their Effee‘ts confiscated. Thirdly, because such who are excommuni-
cated by the Inquisitors, and perfist with an obstinate Mind for the Space of-¹
a Year under Excommunication, must be judged as Hereticks, and become,
subiect to the Punishments published against Hereticks. As appears from
the⁵ Law oi the Emperor Frederick, beginning, Patarenorum ·, and from many
other Laws. Fourthly, because they can excommunicate with the greater.
Excommunication all who partake with Persons excommunicated by them,.
such as Hereticks, their Believers‚‚Fav0urers, Receivers and Defenders, ac-
cording to the Bulls of Innocent and Alexander IV. beginning, Noverit universt-
tas vestra. But if any shall contemptuousty resuse to avoid such Persons‚ after being
marked out by the Church, let them be excommunicatori, and otherwise punished with.
due Severity.
