must take him into his Custody, and use him according to the Laws made
about Prisoners. If any one is to be brought from very distant PlaceS, they
don’t think it safe for him to lodge in Inns, or private Houses, because by
this Means he might easily make his Escape 3 and therefore the Executor is
usually charged, to go to the Bishops of the Place, if there be any, or to the
secular JudgeS, that the Criminal may be placed and kept in their Jayls. And
this the Inquifitor fignifies by his Letters given to the Executor to the Magi-
strates, through whose Territories the Criminal isto be carried, and exhorts
them to give the neceffary and convenient Affistance to the Executor. And
that no one may dare to oppose him, and that the Criminal may be kept in
sure and safe Custody, they defire he may be attended with a proper Guard.
But this Caution is not necessary in the Cities of Spain. For as soon as ever
the Executor ss1eWS‚ that he is to apprehend any one by Command of the ho·
ly Office, no one dares oppose him. And ifany one should, the Mob would
immediately run together to iend an helping Hand to the holy Office‚ and so
over-power him, that unless he would undergo the severest Treatment, he would,
of his own Accord‚ offer himselfto be taken up by the Executor. All these
Things are largely settled by the Toledo Instruction, An. 1561. Cap. 10, 12,& 13.

in by the Beadle, with his Head, Arms and Feet naked, and is followed

by one of the KeeperS. When they come to the Chamber of Audience,

the Beadle enters first, makes a profound Reverence before the Inquifitor,

fit down on a Bench at the other End of the Table over against the Secretary.

The Inquifitor s1ts on his right Hand. On the Table near the Criminal lies

a Missal, or Book of the Gospels, and he is ordered to lay his Hand on one

of them, and to swear that he will declare the Truth, and keep Secrecy.

After taking this Oath of declaring the Truth both of himself and othersst't'ffflff,
