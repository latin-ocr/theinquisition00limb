Sinners ς, but that they can give to those they receive, the Holy Spiriss in order to

theigssgvsstlzgrtthmony: Yhat it is always sinful, and cannot be without Sin 3 and fol. 40.

was never appointed by the good God. Also: That carnal Matrimony betweenfil. 82. b.
a Man and Wman, is not true Matrimony, nor good, nor lawful‚ nor appointed
by God ; buta quite dffrentspiritual Matrimony. .

As to the Incarnation os Christ z That the Lord dia' not take a real humane Bo· sol. 40‘
dy, nor real humane Flelh of our Nature 3 and that he did not really arise with it,
nor do other Things relating to our Salvation3 nor stt down at the Right-hancl of
the Father with it, but only with the Likeneſs of it. They affirm also: T hat the
most holy Virgin Mary, the Mother of our Lord, neither is, nor was a carnal Wo-
man, but their Church, which they say is true Penitence ; and that this is the Vir-
gin Mary. Or as we head elsewhere ε· That God ¹never enter'd into the Womhftt. εμὲ,
of the bleffed Virgin Mary ; and that he‘only is· the Mother, and Brother, and
Sister of God, that keeps the Commands of God the Father.‹ Likewise, that is was 1⁶01· 120, b,v
impoffihle for God to be incarnate 3 because he never humbled himself so much, as to
put himself in the Womb of PVoman.

Concerning the Resurrection of‘ the Dead :· They are charged'with clenyingfi,1‚ 120· ὃ,
the Refitrrefftion of Bodies. Or : There will be no future Resurreb't‘t'on of humane fot, 14⁶·
Bodies 3 and altho' the Souls of Men shall come to Judgment, they shall not come in their
Bodies„ Which is elsewhere more distinffly explain'dz- That they imagine cz fot. 40,-
Sort ofsp'iritual Bodies, ancla‘Sort of an inward Man 3 in which Bodies Persons
are hereafter to rise. One of the Albigenſses is said to have believed, that when fil, 1460.
the Souls of wicked Men are gone out of their Bodies‚ before and after Judgment,
they go through los Bauffes, and los Tertres, i. e. over Rocks and Precipises 3 and

, that the Devil throws· them headlong from the Rocks. Also‚ T hat the Souls of Men,

even after their Separation from the Boa'y, have Plesh and Bones, Hands and Feet,
and all Members 3 which though they are thrown by Devils headlong from the Roeks,
and by this Means tormented‚ yet can never die.

As to the Adoration of the. Cross : That no Man ought to adore the Croſs:fi›l. 685!
Which in another Place is very odioussy represented, viz. T hat the Sign of thesol. ς,
holy Croſs, which the universal Church worships as the Emhlem of our Salvatz‘on, and
the Reprcssentation os our Lord’s Paffion, is a detestahle Emhlenz of the Devil. And
the Reason of this ie added elsewhere ε That the Cross of Chrzst ought not fel· 176,-
to be adored ·‚ because no Man worships the Gallows upon which his Father was
han ecl.
