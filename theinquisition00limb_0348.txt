180 The H1sT0RY ofthe INQmsi-TioN.

if the Notary or Inquifitor doth not understand the Language ofthe one or
other, the Inquifitor must have a skilful Interpreter. For it may hap*
pen that a Frenchmnn, a Spaniard, an Englz' oman, or a German may be exa'-
min'd before an Italian Inquifitor. The Depofitions of the Witneffes and the
Confeffions of the Criminals, are to be written down by the Notaries, in the
same VVords in which they are deliver'd. And when there are several· Wit-
nesses, 'tis not sufficient that the Notary, when he hath particularly wrote
down the Depofitions of the first Witness‚ says, that the second or third says
entirely the same as the first ; but he must write down the particular Words of
the several Witneffes, because oftentimes the Case before this Tribunal is the
Proof of formal H‘eresy. Clement VIII. in a general Congregation of the In-
quifition, November 9, 1600. hath particularly commanded the Inquisition
not to omit any os the Interrogatories which are made by the Judge, in th‘e
Examination of the Witneffes and Criminals, but to write them down at‘large..
[Yea, so favourable are they to this Affair of the Faith, that though the No·-
taries should make one false Libel‚ yet all their others are valid, whils’t they
Ex clos. are kept in Office ·‚ although when the Author is condemned, the Book is conr-
in cap. , monly condemned too. Ibid.]
Fraterm- ‘⁶ These Notaries are to be chosen of the Laity ; but in Caufes ofHeresy, the
‘²⁰⁵‘ ‘⁶ Clergy and Monks, and also others in holy Orders may discharge this Office.
“ And although in Spain they usually· take them from amongst the Laity, yet

§- 7· “ from the Clergy, because they would wantless than thosewho have W1ves and'·
“ Children ς for the Salary is scarce sufficientfor one. They are also obliged
⁶‘ to register in a certain Book, all the Commands of the Inquifflors, given
“ to the Executors and Receivers, against Hereticks, and, their Effects 3·
‘⁶ that if any Qestion should arise concerning these Things, they may be
“ able, from those Registers, to determine it. Belides, they must be con-
“ tent with their Salary, and receive nothing for their writing, except th²e
“ Notary of the forfeited Effecsts, who may demand'hislawful Dues, because
“ he hath no Salary. They must also travel at their own Expences within
“ their proper Province, to ratify the Depofitions of the Witness'es, the Proof
“ of the Defences, and the Exceptions against the Witneffes, as it is contain’d
“ in a certain Decree of the Council.'' C. ut Officium. §. ad conscribendum. de

Pegna, in, Heretofore the Roman Pontiffs made several Provisions to support Persons
aare& ΨΜ· to register the Aets of the Inquifition, because the Inquifitors were poor, and
3· “m’' ²0· could not maintain a certain Notary, who should be appropriated >tothis Bust-
ness ·‚ sometimes dispenfing with the Clergy and Religious‚ who were Notaries
before, that they might exercise the Office of Notaries in the Cause of the
Faith 3 sometimes allowing that two proper Persons should register the
Transaffions, to whom full Credit should be given. This was decreed by the
Council of Biterre. Cap. IV. Take Onths from thofi’, who being thus cited before you,
