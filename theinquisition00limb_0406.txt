The Hieroni( of the INQUISITION.

mined upon his being apprehended, they give out the Order to that Officer,
who, according to the Custom of the holy Office, is to take up Criminals·,
and his Order is subscribed by the Inquisitors. If several Persons are to be
taken up the same Day and Time, they give an Order for each Person, which
is inserted in their respective Proceffes, that such Acts, which are ol? great>
Weight, may appear openly.

As to the second. All Criminals have not alike Places of Imprisonmen't,
their Cells being either more terrible and clark, or more easy and cheat-ful, ac-
cording to the Qality of the Persons and their Offences. ln Reality there is
no Place in the Prison ofthe Inquisition, that can be called pleasant or cheat·
ful, the whole Jayl is so horrible and nasty.

'l'hese Jayls are called in Spain and Portugal, Santcz Cafiz, i. e. the holy House.
Every Thing it seems in this Office must be holy. The Prisons are so built, as
the Author of the History ofthe Inquisition at Goa describes them, that they
will hold a great Number of Persons. They consist of several Porticoes, every
one ofwhich is divided into several small Cells of asquare Form, each Side
being about ten Foot. There are two Rows of them, one being built over
the other, and all of them vaulted. The upper ones are enlightned by Iron
Grates, placed above the Height of a tall Man. The lower ones are under
Ground, dark, without any Window‚ and narrower than the upper ones. The
Walls are five Foot thick. Each Cell is fastned with two Doors, the inner
one thick, and covered over with Iron, and in the lower Part of it there is an
Iron Grate. In the upper Part of it is a little small Window‚ through which
they reach to the Prisoner his Meat, Linnen, and other Neceffaries, which is
shut with two Iron Bolts. The outer Door is entire without any opening at
all. They generally open it in the Morning, from six a Clock till eleven, in
order to refresti the Air of the Prison.

In Portugal all the Prisoners, Men and Women,without any Regard to Birth
or Dignity, are ssiaved the first or second Day of their Imprisonment. Every
Prisoner harh two Pots of Water every Day, one to waih, and the other to
drink, and a Besom to cleanse his Cell, and a Mat made of Rulhes to lie upon,
and a larger Vessel to ease Nature, with a Cover to put over it, which is
changed once every four Days. The Provisions which are given to the Pri·
soners, are rated according to the Season, and the Dearness or Plenty of Eata-
bles. But if any rich Perlon is imprisoned, and will live and eat beyond the
ordinary Rare of Provisions, and according to his own Manner, he may be
indulged, and have what is decent, and fit for him, his Servant, or ServantS,
ifhe liath any, with him in the Jayl. Ifthere are any Provilions left, the Jayl-
Keeper, and no other, must take them, and give them to the Poor, But
Reginald Consalvius observes, p. 106. that this Indulgence is not allowed to
Prisoners of all forts, but to such only as are taken up for small Offences,
who are to be condemned to a Fine. But if they find by the very Accusation
that any Persons are to be punilhed with F orfeiture of all their Effects, they
do not suffer them to live so plentisully, but order them a small Penfion for
their Subfistence, viz. about thirty Maravedis, of the Value of ten Dutch

Stivers.
