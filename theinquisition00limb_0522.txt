The H1 sTORY ofthe INQmsmroN.

then the secular Judge may punish the same Persons for Crimes cognisable in
his C< urt.

They say there are two Ways of discovering these WitcheS. The fi'rst is
the Confestim, and Accusation of their Companions„ For as these Women
know one another when they are met at their Affemblies, they are able to
dete& each other, But that such Accusations may gain Credit, 'tis necessary
that several of them separately, each making a Confeffion without the other’s
Knowledge, do agree in the several Circumstances of the Accusadon, viz. as
to thesame Person, Time and Place, and that they do severally affirm the
same Th{ng before the Person accused, one after the other separately„ with-
out the other's knovsing of it. And yet at the same time they confess themselves,
that this sort ofProos is very uncertain, because it may happen that the Devil
may sometimes assume another Person's Shape, and appear in these Affems
blies under that Form, in order to render her infamous, though at the same,
time she may be entirely innocent, and far from being concerned in such a.
Crime. Por which reason they make use of another Way, viz. Conjectures
and Presumptions to detect and discover them. Andos these they have seve-
ml, viz. their bewitching Children, causing Distempers and other Harms to
Men and Women, to Cattle, and the Fruits of the Earth, the Grapes ok
Vineyards, and the Fruits of Trees. When therefore skilful Phyficians by
ztny Conicelures or Circumstancesjudge, that a Damage ofthis sort doth not
huppen sromany natural Defect, nor from any natural intrinsick Cause, but
from something external, and yet not from any venemous Infection 3 or when
they see any Disease to be incurable, so that the sick Person cannot be relieved
by any Medicines or Remedies, but rather grows every Day worse and worse„
this they think is a sufficient Proof that 'tis the Effee't of Witchcrast. In like
manner, when any Men or Women, who are ignorant of the Art of Phyfick„
preventthe Esi'ects of such Witchcrafts‚ and heal Diseases, they say ’'tis a,
Sign that these Things are done by the Co-operation of the Devil.

To this they add another Sign, which is greatly uncertain. When, say
they, any Person, whether in a Qarrel or not, threatens another, and says,
Because you have done to me so and so, I will do something to you that shall
make you know whether you have done well by me or not3 or Ι will make
you repent it·, or you shall see the ill Effeets ofir, or any Thing to the like,
Purpose. ls the Thing comes to pass, 'tis a Sign that such an Effe& is pro—
duced by the Affistance of the Devil, especially if it can't be known how such
an Effe& could otherwise follow. And therefore when such Threatnings are
attended with their Effects, 'tis a very great Presumption and Reason to con-
clude, that the Person who utters such Threatnings is a Witch, and dedicated„
to the Devil by a Denial of the Faith. This is a sufficient Proof to proceed
to Torture.

But certainly if such Signs be sufficient to put Persons to -the Torture, what
Innocence can be safe? ''sis easy to extort a Confeffion from such who are
:most innocent, by the Cruelty of these Tortures‚ with which they punish

without End or Mea-sure, those whom they suspect, as the very Plagues of
uman
