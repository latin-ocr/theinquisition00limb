straint on their Sins, as that there may be some to repent that they have finned,
So that tho’ he intercedes for them that they should not be put to Deam, yet
the only Punissiment he would have Hereticks exempted from is Death.
Hence in his Epistle to Cresconius the Grammarian, b. 3. c. 50. he saith: No
good Men in the C atholick Church are pleased, that any one, even an Hereuck, should
be punifhed with Death. But as to all other Methods of Persecution‚ Austin is
so far from being against them, that he recommends them, as a Remedy pro-
per for the Extirpation of Heresies. Hence in his first Book against Gau·
demtus, c. 5. he says: God forbid that this should be called persecuting Men,
when 'tis only a persecuting their Vices‚ in order to deli-ver them from the Power
of them ·‚ just as the Phystcian treats his distemper'd Patient.

This then is the so much admired Clemency of Austin, that he interceded
with the Proconsuls‚ that the Donatists should not be punished with Death 3
whilst at the same Time he not only approved of all other Penalties except
Death‚ such as Banishment, the denying them Power to make Wills, to in·
herit their Patrimony, or to receive what was left them by others, of ma-
king Contraets, buying and selling‚ and the like ·, but he himself accused them
to the Proconsuls, that if they perfisted in these Opinions‚ they might suffer
these Puniihrnents. Who doth not see, that under such Circumstances, Life
is sometimes worse than Death ? And that, as Arcadius and Honorius decreed
with respect to the Children of those condemned for Treason, Life would be
a Punishment, and Death a real Relief? 'Tis much more terrible to pine away
in Poverty, Banishment, and other Miseries‚ and then perish by a lingering
Death, than to be killed outright‚ tho' in a cruel and bloody manner. Yea
sometimes, such hath been the Cruelty ofPersecutors, that they have denied
those they have persecuted‚ Death, that they might not seem to give them the
Honour of Martysdom ·‚ whilst they have invented and exercised on thern
all manner of Miseries and Tortures, that by the Weight and Length of
their Puniihments, they mIght force them to a Denial of their Faith. There
is no need to produce many Proofs or Examples of this Nature, or to search
into Antiquity for Instances. Ι shall only produce two fresh ones, one of which
now presents it sels to us in France,. There we see that the miserable Reform³d
are not punish’d with Death, but given> up to the licentious Abuses of Sol»
diers, and that they have no End os their Troubles, unless they abjure the
Reform'd Religion. And yet all the Reform'd unanimoussy agree, they ne·-
ver suffer'd aimore grievous Persecution. Bohemicz will afford us another In-
stance of Persons forced by the like Cruelty toApostacy. We read in the
History of the Bohemian Persecution, c. 99. that when the Vice Chamberlain
of the Kingdom had solicited the Inhabitants of the City Tusta in vain to Aposta·
cy, and was complaining of their Obstinacy in the jesuits College at Progne, one
Martyn de litanda, a Spaniard, was present, and laughed at it, and promised to
