' are said to do, deserve no Belief, because they don’t seem poffible to be done.

Their Confeffions are ¹osten extorted by the Violence of their Torture, and
conceived in such Words, that any considerate Person >³nay see they are form-

ed by the Inquifitors themselves, viz. to encrease the Honour of the bles-

sed Mam, and ofthe Sacraments, as though the Devil had a particular Spight

to the Worship of them.· And this is so evident and manifest, that many of

the Papists themselves are persuaded, that most of those are innocent, whom,

on this Account, they have seen condemned to the Fire. Yea, a certain

Popish Divine published an entire Book, entitled, Cautionis criminalis, in which

he tells us that many innocent Persons were burnr. 3 and this he affirms, not:
